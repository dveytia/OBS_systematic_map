   Social-Ecological Resilience of Coastal Fishers-A Case Study of
   Bangladesh},

Abstract = {The importance of recreational fishing, in many coastal areas and less
   developed nations, is increasing rapidly. Connecting fisheries to
   tourism can create innovative tourism products and provide new income
   sources. The present study is the first to explore the concept of
   coastal fishery-based ecotourism (FbE) to enhance the social-ecological
   resilience of coastal fishing communities in a specific tourist spot in
   Bangladesh. A combination of primary (quantitative and qualitative) and
   secondary (literature databases) data sources were used in this study.
   It applied a social-ecological system (SES) and social-ecological
   resilience (SER) concept to collect quantitative and qualitative data
   (120 in-depth individual interviews, four focus group discussions, and
   strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats-SWOT analyses) and frame
   their interpretation. The study found that Bangladesh needs to adopt a
   firm policy to utilize tourism's potential in national economic
   development and societal progress. The findings show the considerable
   potential of the concept that integrates business, education, and an
   environmental conservation perspective in Bangladesh, specifically for
   Saint Martin's Island: 32\% of interviewees expressed that increasing
   employment opportunities and the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) is the
   primary potential, whereas 31\% said it would attract fishing tourists
   and 23\% believed it would develop the local infrastructure and
   facilities for fishing and tourism. Similarly, most of the respondents
   (31\%) thought that the lack of awareness and promotional activities is
   the main limitation preventing this initiative from being well accepted.
   Moreover, based on the findings, specific measures for strengthening the
   social-ecological resilience of the coastal fishers via FbE at the local
   level were suggested, including building communal links, developing
   community infrastructures, revising prevailing rules and regulations,
   offering alternative means of generating income for fishers during
   disaster periods, and more active sharing of responsibility between
   stakeholders and government for the management of FbE. Finally, with its
   focus on the prospects and challenges of coastal FbE development on
   Saint Martin's Island, this article provides a useful reference point
   for future discourse on similar social and economic strategies. While
   this study focuses on Bangladesh's coastal fishing villages, the results
   are possibly applicable more broadly in similar contexts and developing
   countries worldwide.},

Title = {Evaluation of Cost-Benefit and Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic for
   Incoming Travelers Through Tests in Origin in Spain},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe World Health Organization has promoted preventive measures
   for reducing the impact of the pandemic. One of these measures was tests
   in origin for travelers. Testing strategies for COVID-19 facilitate the
   overall public health response to the pandemic and contributes to
   minimize the infection among the population COVID-19. GoalIn this work,
   we assess the efficiency of diagnostic testing of incoming travelers in
   the Canary Islands, Spain, during a period of 4 months, with a focus on
   the economic impact for the regional government. We study the
   cost-benefit of this measure as well as the potential influence on the
   number of positive cases in the population. MethodsWe processed the real
   data in the Canary Islands of pre-flight PCR and antigen tests that were
   required to the residents when traveling back to the Canaries from
   anywhere in Spain in a period of 4 months, from 14 December, 2020 to 4
   April, 2021. As a result, we calculated the economic impact of doing
   those tests and compare them with the estimated costs of passengers
   under the hypothesis of entering the islands without testing. The
   cost-benefit was obtained for different scenarios, where the incoming
   passengers generated hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) costs
   directly and via transmissions. ResultsThe incoming testing funded by
   the government, if applied during the bad evolution of the pandemic with
   1.2 ratio of transmission, clearly saved money to the public health
   system. In addition to the economic impact of this measure, we estimated
   the potential influence on the number of positive cases in the
   population according to different scenarios of the propagation of the
   pandemic. At the beginning of February 2021, the savings were about
   euro130.551,47, with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) of
   euro24.677,94-236.425,00. By the end of April 2021, the savings were
   above euro2,000,000 (euro2.284.788,50 on average and 95\% CI of
   euro2.092.914,84-2.476.662,16) and the savings increased as the pandemic
   evolved. At the end of the period, the savings were twice the expenses.
   ConclusionsTesting in origin has proved to be a good measure that helped
   to mitigate COVID-19 spread among regions. Our results confirm that the
   free PCR or rapid antigen tests produce relevant savings to the public
   budget. We studied 61.990 reported data during 2020 and 2021 from the
   travelers from national flights, against 346.449 of total incoming
   travelers to the Canary Islands in this period. The measure pursued by
   the Government of the Canary Islands of providing free tests for
   residents showed a clear benefit for both, limiting the propagation of
   COVID-19 and reducing the costs of the hospitalizations and ICU
   admissions. It should be noted that the free testing measure in this
   period was before starting the vaccination campaigns. As measure of
   public health in the airports, testing helped to control and make the
   mobility of travelers secure.},

Title = {Early increases in artisanal shore-based fisheries in a Nature-based
   Solutions mangrove rehabilitation project on the north coast of Java},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {267},

Abstract = {We studied nearshore diurnal fish catches and fisheries development in
   the early stages of mangrove rehabilitation around the village of
   Timbulsloko on the central north coast of Java, Indonesia. Mangrove
   rehabilitation was part of a Nature-based Solutions project to
   re-establish ecological and economic resilience by combining coastal
   engineering measures with ecological recovery in conjunction with
   sustainable land and resource use. Creel surveys were conducted during
   the onset of the monsoon season October-December 2017 to document yields
   of the three main fishing gears targeting mangrove finfish in a 419 ha
   mangrove backwater basin. These were accompanied by structured
   interviews to obtain fisher views on developments in these fisheries.
   Analysis of satellite images and GIS-mapping were used to follow
   developments in mangrove coverage and effort in the estuarine lift-net
   fishery. Mangrove recovery between 2005 and 2018 achieved 8.5\% of its
   maximum possible (historic) cover potential in the basin and followed an
   exponential growth curve. The increase in lift-net installations
   targeting finfish lagged in comparison to mangrove increase, remaining
   virtually zero till 2014, after which it rapidly increased. A baseline
   study in 2015 found no mangrove-associated finfish fisheries occurring
   in our study area. The 51 fishers surveyed in 2017, indicated that
   fishing activity in the area had strongly increased since 2015, with
   45\% of fishers stating to having started fishing this area a year
   earlier or even more recently. A significant majority of 87\% of
   respondents with more than one year of experience at this location,
   stated that their catches had changed in terms of either fish size,
   quantity or composition since they started fishing, while 86\% indicated
   improvement in terms of either size or quantity. Fishing generated about
   1.05 +/- 1.11 (SD) USD/hr worth of catch to professional fishers using
   either of the two net-types studied. As per 2017, fishing had become
   profitable in our study area, whereas this kind of fishery practically
   did not exist prior to 2014. We suggest that higher profitability may
   partially explain the rapid growth seen in fishing activity in the
   mangrove rehabilitation area. However, for 12 of the 18 larger species
   caught, the mean size in the catch was lower than mean size of
   maturation, indicating that these fisheries were principally targeted
   towards immature nursery fish. The results highlight the need to manage
   this currently developing fishery, otherwise any benefits to the local
   community might be nullified by overfishing.},

Title = {Hull fouling as an invasion vector: can simple models explain a complex
   problem?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {P>1. The most effective way to manage nonindigenous species and their
   impacts is to prevent their introduction via vector regulation. While
   ships' ballast water is very well studied and this vector is actively
   managed, hull fouling has received far less attention and regulations
   are only now being considered despite its importance for introductions
   to coastal, marine systems.
   2. We conducted comprehensive in situ sampling and video recording of
   hulls of 40 transoceanic vessels to assess propagule and colonization
   pressure in Vancouver and Halifax, dominant coastal ports in Canada.
   Concomitant sampling was conducted of harbour fouling communities to
   compare hull and port communities as part of a vector risk assessment.
   3. Although this vector has been operational for a long time, hull and
   harbour communities were highly divergent, with mean S circle divide
   rensen's similarity values of 0 center dot 03 in Halifax and 0 center
   dot 01 in Vancouver, suggesting invasion risk is high. Propagule
   pressure (up to 600 000 ind. ship-1) and colonization pressure (up to
   156 species ship-1) were high and varied significantly between ports,
   with Vancouver receiving much higher abundances and diversity of
   potential invaders. The higher risk of fouling introductions in
   Vancouver is consistent with historical patterns of successful hull
   fouling invasions.
   4. The extent of hull fouling was modelled using ship history
   predictors. Propagule pressure increased with time spent in previous
   ports-of-call and time since last application of antifouling paint,
   whereas colonization pressure increased with time since last painting
   and with the number of regions visited by the ship. Both propagule and
   colonization pressure were negatively related to the time spent at sea
   and the latitude of ports visited.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A major challenge for applied invasion
   ecology is the effective management of introduction vectors. We found
   that hull fouling has a strong potential for introduction of many
   species to coastal marine habitats and that management should be
   considered. Simple variables related to the vessels' hull husbandry,
   voyage, and sailing patterns may be used to predict and manage hull
   fouling intensity. The results presented here should interest policy
   makers and environmental managers who seek to reduce invasion risk, and
   ship owners seeking to optimize fuel efficiency.},

Title = {Modeling complexometric titrations of natnral water samples},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Complexometric titrations are the primary source of metal speciation
   data for aquatic systems, yet their interpretation in waters containing
   humic and fulvic acids remains problematic. In particular, the accuracy
   of inferred ambient free metal ion concentrations and parameters
   quantifying metal complexation by natural ligands has been challenged
   because of the difficulties inherent in calibrating common analytical
   methods and in modeling the diverse array of ligands present. This work
   tests and applies a new method of modeling titration data that combines
   calibration of analytical sensitivity (S) and estimation of
   concentrations and stability constants for discrete natural ligand
   classes ({[}LIT and Q into a single step using nonlinear regression and
   a new analytical solution to the one-metal/two-ligand equilibrium
   problem. When applied to jointly model data from multiple titrations
   conducted at different analytical windows, it yields accurate estimates
   of S, {[}LIT, K-i, and {[}Cu2+] plus Monte Carlo-based estimates of the
   uncertainty in {[}Cu2+]. Jointly modeling titration data at lowand
   high-analytical windows leads to an efficient adaptation of the recently
   proposed ``overload{''} approach to calibrating ACSV/CLE measurements.
   Application of the method to published data sets yields model results
   with greater accuracy and precision than originally obtained. The
   discrete ligand-class model is also re-parametrized, using humic and
   fulvic acids, L-1 class (K-1 = 10(13) M-1), and strong ligands (Ls) with
   Ks much greater than K-1 as ``natural components{''}. This approach
   suggests that Cu complexation in NW Mediterranean Sea water can be well
   represented as 0.8 +/- 0.3/0.2 mg humic equiv/L, 13 +/- 1 nM L-1, and
   2.5 +/- 0.1 nM Ls with {[}Cu](T) = 3 nM. In coastal seawater from
   Narragansett Bay, RI, Cu speciation can be modeled as 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg
   humic equiv/L and 22 +/- 1 nM L-1 or similar to12 nM L, and similar to9

Title = {Review of plausible chemical migration pathways in Australian coal seam
   gas basins},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {280-303},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Coal seam gas (CSG) or coal bed methane production has grown
   exponentially in Australia over the last two decades with currently
   nearly 7000 productive wells and another 18,750 wells planned over the
   next five to ten years. To address concerns over environmental
   contamination by hydraulic fracture fluids (HFF) attributed to (i)
   incidents involving poor surface handling of HFF and other fluids with
   potential migration pathways in soil and shallow groundwater, and (ii)
   leakage pathways arising from HFF injection into coal seams and
   unintended migration of these chemicals, the National assessment of
   chemicals associated with coal seam gas extraction in Australia (the
   Assessment) was undertaken. The Assessment included a review of
   international studies on unconventional gas migration pathways to
   provide prior knowledge and comparison for use in the Australian study.
   The international literature highlighted that accidents with HFF were
   mainly due to surface operations and included leaking equipment and
   spills. Contamination risks of groundwater from hydraulic fracturing
   itself were found to be very small based on analysis of micro-seismic
   and groundwater hydrochemistry data; geologic modelling of vertical
   fracture growth further reveals a low risk of leakage pathways
   developing in aquifers confined by deep shale formations. This is due to
   limitations on the fracture growth vertically across aquitards often
   hundreds of meters thick, retention within the shale of limited amounts
   of injected fluid, and preferential fracture growth at shallow depths in
   the horizontal direction. These arguments are broadly applicable to
   Australian CSG basins. However, important differences exist, such as the
   reduced thickness in Australia of the aquitards that separate the
   targeted gas resource from groundwater. Also, hydraulic fracturing in
   Australian coal seams is practised only when permeabilities are too low
   for gas extraction to be economical without stimulation. From the nearly
   10,000 CSG wells drilled in the Bowen and Surat Basins in Queensland,
   only 6\% have received hydraulic fracturing to date. The reduced risk of
   leakage pathways developing during CSG production in Australian basins
   is further corroborated by geologic criteria based on modelling and
   observations. Criteria include encountering certain favourable
   conditions during drilling/injection, i.e. (i) interfaces, such as
   natural fractures, faults, and bedding planes, which promote offsetting
   and branching, or rock layers with higher fracture toughness causing the
   cessation or reduction in fracture growth, (ii) narrow fractures due to
   a relatively higher elastic modulus, leading to higher viscous flow
   loss, (iii) high permeability layers, and (iv) overlying layer (s) with
   a higher confining stress. In addition to the leakage pathways
   considered in North American shale gas basins involving (i) pre-existing
   fractures and faults, or (ii) flow up the production well due to poor
   casing or cementing, plausible chemical migration pathways in Australian
   CSG basins are due to (iii) connectivity via a fracture in or extended
   out of the coal seam formation between CSG wells and water bores
   co-located in the same formation, and (iv) poor integrity water bores
   enhancing inter-aquifer connectivity. These plausible pathways are
   described and used in subsequent work as the basis of risk assessments
   for contamination at the local- and regional scale.},

Abstract = {Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play a major
   role in fish development and metabolism, and several studies have
   allowed discernment of a complex and tissue-specific collection of
   salmonid IGF-I transcripts (Ea-4, Ea-3, Ea-2, Ea-1), which are the
   result of the alternative splicing of the E-domain region. However, the
   pattern of IGF-I expression is different in non-salmonid fish, and only
   one or two transcripts (Ea-4, Ea-2) have been detected in hepatic and
   extrahepatic tissues of common carp, barramundi, black sea bream and
   gilthead sea bream. Despite this, when comparisons are made within
   Mediterranean fish species (European sea bass, common dentex and
   gilthead sea bream), plasma IGF-I levels are consistent with fish
   species differences in growth rates. Changes of growth rates, and plasma
   IGF-I and GH levels are also found in response to changes in diet
   composition and ration size, which may serve to assess the suitability
   of feeding regimes in aquaculture practice. Regulation of plasma
   somatolactin (SL) levels is also examined in gilthead sea bream, and the
   resulting plasma SL profile differs from that of GH. Thus, in contrast
   to GH, plasma SL levels augment with the increase of ration size and
   fish size (advancement of age). A transient increase in plasma SL levels
   is also found in short-term fasted fish, and this fish peptide may act
   as an anti-obesity hormone helping to expedite growth-reproductive
   processes following replenishment of fat stores, and/or mediate the
   adaptation to fasting until the lipolytic action of GH and/or other
   endocrine factors is fully accomplished. This agrees with the known
   increase of plasma SL levels during acute stress and exhaustive
   exercise. However, a causal link between SL and energy mobilisation
   (lipid metabolism) remains to be established, and further research is
   needed to determine the extent to which SL and GH act in a complementary
   manner to make available metabolic fuels and to regulate body fat mass
   and feeding behaviour. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Title = {EST-Microsatellite Types and Structural Scenarios in European Hake
   Fisheries},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The conservation of the maximum genetic background from
   all genomic regions matters for sustainability in the changing global
   scenario. This study focused the importance of integrating such genetic
   variation in order to infer meaningful units for management and
   sustainability. We show that knowledge that can be obtained from
   different marker types should be goal-oriented, i.e., remnant patterns
   of selection pressures and extreme drift episodes (directional markers,
   i.e., the evolutionary genetic background), current evolutionary novelty
   and adaptive potential for fisheries' sustainability (balanced markers,
   i.e., the potential genetic drive of the species), and demographic
   dynamics of genetic relevance for fisheries' management (neutral
   markers, i.e., the present-day fishery structure and connectivity). In
   particular, special attention should be paid to the variation in
   supergenes or balancing markers, which are a rich source of evolutionary
   novelty and can be crucial for species welfare and survival. A fishery's
   structure and connectivity are priors to its effective management. A
   successful description of such processes depends on both the sampling
   design and the choice of adequate genetic markers. EST markers are
   perfusing the studies of marine metapopulations and are believed to
   provide access to functional polymorphisms. However, the assumed
   adaptive role of outlier EST loci might not be generalizable.
   EST-microsatellites represent the upper polymorphic boundary in these
   regions because of their high mutation rate. We have subclassified the
   polymorphisms of EST-microsatellites to assess their structural
   contribution in the European hake, a paradigmatic and highly mobile
   marine species (HMMS). Because of the counterbalanced forces between
   directional markers (15\%) and balanced markers (23\%), the whole marker
   set offers the same structural situation as the one observed with
   neutral markers (62\%), i.e., k = 2 gene pools. In contrast to outlier
   EST- microsatellites, neutral EST subsets allow one to measure crucial
   population phenomena for fisheries' management. The high
   inter-population divergence of outlier EST-microsatellites is compatible
   with drifted post-selection genomic regions rather than with ongoing
   local selective pressures. The structural scenario in hake is
   explainable by a limited gene flow across the Almeria-Oran Front (AOF)
   and by the within-basin IBD pattern of connectivity plus drift-related
   demographic events. This study highlights how polymorphic properties of
   EST-microsatellite types can be useful to address mutually excluding
   research tasks in fisheries, i.e., to address its evolutionary history
   (directional markers or FAPS: Fossil Adaptive Polymorphic Systems); to
   delineate management units (neutral markers or NAPS: Non Adaptive
   Polymorphic Systems); or to ensure sustainability (balanced markers or
   APS: Adaptive Polymorphic Systems).},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Fish captures from the Red Sea in the Egyptian waters have sharply
   declined from 73,549 metric tons in 2001 to 44,000 metric tons in 2010.
   Our research was conducted using an ecosystem-based fisheries assessment
   (EBFA) approach and a Tier 2 qualitative assessment. The periods 2002
   and 2012 were targeted for assessment the status of fish stocks. Nested
   risk indices, such as objectives risk index(ORI), species risk
   index(SRI), fishery risk index (FRI)-and ecosystem risk index (ERI)were
   also implemented.The results of the reference point indicators were
   compared with those from 2002 and 2012 to show the assessment of
   species, fisheries and ecosystems in both years.Management status for
   year 2012 exhibited significant negative change compared that in 2002
   regarding attributes such as sustainability, biodiversity, habitat
   quality and socio-economics. Seven fish species were chosen as the
   target species and SRI was assessed by the Tier 2 approach. The results
   showed that 80 \% of indicators are found in the safe zone with green
   colour; 18.1 \% are located in the limited range or yellow zone; 1.9
   \%arelocated beyond the safety limits or in the red zone in 2002. For
   2012, 27.6 \% of indicators in safe zone with green colour were
   recorded, with 48.6 \% in the limited range or yellow zone and 23.8 \%
   in out of safety limits or red zone. Purse seine, trawl and longline
   nets accounted for 89.43 \% in 2002 and 80.3 \%in 2012. FRI values were
   recorded at 0.44, 0.79 and 0.46 respectively in 2002 and located in the
   safe zone with green colour. Furthermore, in 2012, FRI values were
   recorded at 1.78, 1.85 and 1.24 respectively and moved to limited range
   or the yellow zone.ERI was recorded at 0.70 in 2002 (safe zone with
   green colour) but in 2012 it was recorded at 1.69 (limited range or
   yellow zone). The results showed significant negative changes in 2012
   compared to that in 2002 based on sustainability of fish stock, catch
   biodiversity, habitat quality and socio-economics. Four management
   objectives are recommended for reducing risk indices and improve the
   ecosystem of the Red Sea.},

Abstract = {The objective of systematic conservation planning is to select areas to
   protect or rehabilitate ecological assets in the most efficient way.
   After setting targets for ecological assets, heuristic algorithms or
   optimization techniques are employed to meet these targets.
   This technique - traditionally only used in terrestrial and marine
   settings - has recently been adapted to river management, acknowledging
   spatial constraints arising from the connected nature of rivers.
   However, terrestrial heuristics and optimization techniques employed to
   solve the minimum-set or maximum-coverage problem in conservation
   planning scenarios have been designed to deal with non-connected
   systems. Therefore, different algorithms will perform better or worse in
   a riverine setting. In this study, we compare the performance of two
   different techniques to identify important cells for meeting ecological
   targets in terms of efficiency, congruence and computational effort.
   The first technique is a heuristic algorithm, often used in classic
   conservation planning problem. Heuristics operate in a stepwise manner,
   selecting for the most taxa rich or the rarest feature first, then
   recalculate the selection matrix and run until all conservation targets
   are covered. To ensure connectivity of planning units is preserved, we
   modified the rules of the heuristic: Isolated planning units in the
   middle of a river system cannot be selected. Instead the entire
   catchment area upstream will have to be protected
   The second method is an extension of the conservation software package
   MARXAN. After allocating a random initial reserve, planning units are
   randomly added to and taken out. Each step is evaluated against an
   objective function that considers the achieved conservation targets, as
   well as cost and compactness of the reserve system. The last measure -
   compactness of the reserve system - is used to accommodate MARXAN to
   lotic systems. Instead of penalising for all boundaries of a planning
   unit, only the planning units that are crossed by a river are counted.
   We found that while the heuristic assigned a higher range of
   irreplaceability values, the areas of high conservation value were
   similar in both algorithms. When comparing the best solutions (also
   termed near-minimum sets), we found that an increasing boundary penalty
   in MARXAN also increases the reserve network. While a run without
   penalty only needs 27 out of 1854 planning units, this increases to 174
   units at penalty 10 and 696 at penalty hundred. At boundary penalty 100,
   not all features were captured, as the penalty for compactness exceeded
   the penalty for not meeting targets.
   The 174 units at penalty 10 take up a slightly smaller area than the
   best solution of the heuristic algorithm. Boundary penalty 10 seems to
   be the optimal penalty in the current dataset. While it is not as strict
   in the upstream protection as the modified heuristic, it still creates a
   network of compact reserves at a configuration that is easier to
   achieve. However, because of the lack in the strict upstream protection,
   the reserve network might not be adequate for some of the targets,
   depending on the strength of upstream disturbance.
   While this is a great step forward to advance river conservation
   planning, more research into the tradeoffs between whole catchment
   protection and practicality will have to be conducted.
   Currently, the node-based approach in the heuristic ensures to find a
   near-optimal set under the constraints that whole-catchment protection
   is needed. With a medium boundary penalty setting, MARXAN can deliver
   more efficient reserve designs, but this could lead to inadequate
   protection. As a future research direction, we recommend to include
   information about the downstream extent of disturbance to ensure
   adequacy.},

Abstract = {A reliance on diesel generated power and a history of imperfect fuel
   management have created a legacy of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination
   at subantarctic Macquarie Island. Increasing environmental awareness and
   advances in contaminant characterisation and remediation technology have
   fostered an impetus to reduce the environmental risk associated with
   legacy sites. A funnel and gate permeable bio-reactive barrier (PRB) was
   installed in 2014 to address the migration of Special Antarctic Blend
   diesel from a spill that occurred in 2002, as well as older spills and
   residual contaminants in the soil at the Main Power House. The PRB gate
   comprised of granular activated carbon and natural clinoptilolite
   zeolite. Petroleum hydrocarbons migrating in the soil water were
   successfully captured on the reactive materials, with concentrations at
   the outflow of the barrier recorded as being below reporting limits. The
   nutrient and iron concentrations delivered to the barrier demonstrated
   high temporal variability with significant iron precipitation observed
   across the bed. The surface of the granular activated carbon was largely
   free from cell attachment while natural zeolite demonstrated patchy
   biofilm formation after 15 months following PRB installation. This study
   illustrates the importance of informed material selection at field scale
   to ensure that adsorption and biodegradation processes are utilised to
   manage the environmental risk associated with petroleum hydrocarbon
   spills. This study reports the first installation of a permeable
   bio-reactive barrier in the subantarctic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Three-dimensional discrete element simulation on degradation of air
   voids in double-layer porous asphalt pavement under traffic loading},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {313},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Porous asphalt pavement is credited with a variety of environmental
   benefits, including improvement of stormwater management, enhancement of
   underground water quality, mitigation of heat-island effect, and
   reduction of traffic noise. However, the sustainability of these
   functions is a major practical concern as they are seriously affected by
   clogging in the porous pavement. This study proposed three-dimensional
   discrete element simulation to evaluate degradation of air voids in the
   double-layer porous pavement under traffic loading. Double-layer porous
   asphalt pavement having 25 mm upper layer with 20\% porosity and 40 mm
   lower layer with 22\% porosity was designed. Temperature-dependent
   micromechanical parameters of contact models in asphalt mastic were
   determined by conducting laboratory dynamic creep test. The virtual
   wheel tracking test was verified and performed on the virtual
   double-layer porous asphalt pavement specimen. It has demonstrated that
   the connected voids content is decreased by 19.8\%, 30.2\%, and 1.7\% in
   the whole specimen, within the loading and non-loading areas of the
   specimen, respectively as strain is increased from 0.01 to 0.12 during
   the wheel tracking test. Furthermore, the long-term degradation model of
   air voids in the double-layer porous asphalt pavement under traffic
   loading was formulated. At service life of 20 years, the connected voids
   content is decreased by 9.9\%, 16.2\%, and 0.7\% in the whole specimen,
   within the loading and non-loading areas of the specimen under light
   traffic, respectively. When subjected to medium, heavy, and extra heavy
   traffic for 20 years, the connected voids content within the loading
   region of the specimen is reduced by 18.2\%, 19.5\%, and 20.4\%,
   respectively. The long-term degradation of air voids in the double-layer
   porous asphalt pavement has important implications on its performance
   and functionalities. This study develops a methodology to predict air
   voids degradation of the double-layer porous asphalt pavement under
   traffic loading, which provides useful information for pavement
   engineers in the design of porous asphalt pavement.},

Title = {First long-term and near real-time measurement of trace elements in

Abstract = {Atmospheric trace elements, especially metal species, are an emerging
   environmental and health concern with insufficient understanding of
   their levels and sources in Shanghai, the most important industrial
   megacity in China. Here we continuously performed a 1 year (from March
   2016 to February 2017) and hourly resolved measurement of 18 elements in
   fine particles (PM2.5) at the Shanghai urban center with an Xact
   multi-metals monitor and several collocated instruments. Mass
   concentrations (mean +/- 1 sigma; ng m(-3)) determined by Xact ranged
   from detection limits (nominally 0.1 to 20 ng m(-3)) to 15 mu g m(-3).
   Element-related oxidized species comprised an appreciable fraction of
   PM2.5 during all seasons, accounting for 8.3\% on average. As a
   comparison, the atmospheric elements concentration level in Shanghai was
   comparable with that in other industrialized cities in East Asia but 1
   or 2 orders of magnitude higher than at sites in North America and
   Europe. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to identify and
   apportion the sources of the elements in the PM2.5 mass. Five different
   factors were resolved (notable elements and relative contribution in
   parentheses): traffic-related (Ca, Fe, Ba, Si; 46 \%), shipping (V, Ni;
   6 \%), nonferrous metal smelting (Ag, Cd, Au; 15 \%), coal combustion
   (As, Se, Hg, Pb; 18 \%) and ferrous metal smelting (Cr, Mn, Zn; 15 \%).
   The contribution from the exhaust and non-exhaust vehicle emissions,
   i.e., the traffic-related factor shows a strong bimodal diurnal profile
   with average concentration over 2 times higher during the rush hour than
   during nighttime. The shipping factor was firmly identified because V
   and Ni, two recognized tracers of shipping emissions, are almost
   exclusively transported from the East China Sea and their ratio (around
   3.2) falls within the variation range of V / Ni ratios in particles
   emitted from heavy oil combustion. Interestingly, nearly half of the K
   was derived from coal combustion with high mineral affinity (elements
   associated with aluminosilicates, carbonates and other minerals in coal
   ash). The contributions of nonferrous metal smelting to the trace
   elements are consistent with a newly developed emission inventory.
   Although the precipitation scavenging effect on the mass concentration
   of the trace elements varied among different species and sources,
   precipitation could effectively lower the concentration of the traffic-
   and coal combustion-related trace elements. Therefore, water spray to
   simulate natural types of precipitation could be one of the abatement
   strategies to facilitate the reduction of ambient PM2.5 trace elements
   in the urban atmosphere. Collectively, our findings in this study
   provide baseline levels and sources of trace elements with high detail,
   which are needed for developing effective control strategies to reduce
   the high risk of acute exposure to atmospheric trace elements in China's
   megacities.},

Abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in
   the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of
   global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks.
   The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of
   wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless
   underlie current approaches to the management of living marine
   resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide
   little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current
   management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of
   fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While
   open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for
   many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have
   access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas,
   the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting
   juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent
   stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal
   stocks often support recruitment.
   An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources
   seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the
   basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a
   broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the
   decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of
   marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to
   harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat
   restoration and conservation of genetic resources.
   The new management framework requires co-management and collective
   decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and
   pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that
   decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and
   precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least
   of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested
   in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to
   management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling
   occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce
   productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks
   imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or
   regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion.
   Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based
   systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established
   healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a
   favourable regime.
   In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after
   regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or
   economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be
   possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a
   stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and
   seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific
   access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of
   vessel operations, even offshore.
   More fundamentally, the basic axiom of `enlightened self interest'
   underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an
   increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

   in developed countries but worldwide. Anthropogenic activity has long
   impacted the marine continental shelf down to a depth of approximately
   -200 m. New activities are now affecting this coastal space such as
   renewable energies, recreational uses and aquaculture in addition to the
   traditional ones of navigation or fishing. This evolution raises new
   sources of conflict amongst users which can require state involvement in
   order to manage the different stakeholders and pressure groups. However,
   the coastal space still offers a large potential for development for two
   reasons. Firstly, the physical three dimensional potential of this space
   enables the whole water column to be used, principally to increase the
   fishing productivity as in Japan. Secondly, innovative synergies can be
   created between socio-technical and ecological uses (a ``fourth
   dimension{''}) such as the eco-design of wind turbine foundations in
   order to create fish habitat or sea grass settlement. This new vision in
   ``4D{''} for the design and the management of coastal infrastructure can
   potentially reduce the risk of conflict as different uses of the coastal
   space would not necessarily exclude one another. Indeed, several forms
   of synergy could be developed such as fisheries with aquaculture or
   biological sustainability with social acceptability. Until now, limited
   attempts at such an approach have been done. We suggest this is likely
   due to the absence of a common eco-engineering vision and the lack of
   experience amongst biologists and engineers in the co-construction of
   projects. This eco-engineering, or ``green{''} vision, also takes into
   account the complexity and resilience of the ecosystem in the long term,
   if underwater engineered infrastructures are also ``eco{''}-designed to
   increase ecological gain This new conception, for development within the
   coastal area, provides for an increased bio-oriented complexity to
   engineered structure and therefore a better resistance of the ecosystem
   in the long term to anthropogenic pressures and a reduction in
   multi-user conflicts.},

Abstract = {In intensive integrated crop-livestock farming systems, the surplus of N
   at the farm scale may be large and reflects on the N balance at the
   field scale. A study was conducted to assess the N fertilizer efficiency
   in four private farms in intensively cropped areas of NW Italy, and to
   monitor the effects of agricultural practices on the mineral N
   concentration of the soil solution, sampled every 2 weeks for 2 years
   and considered as an indicator of potential leaching. Two cultivation
   systems were compared in each farm, one involving continuous maize
   rotation, the other assuring a continuous soil cover (permanent meadow
   or winter cereal-maize double cropping system). The fertilization level
   in the arable crops was high (369-509 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) compared to
   the crop removals, and resulted in a low efficiency, as indicated by the
   four examined efficiency indexes (calculated N surplus, N
   removal-fertilizer ratio, N apparent recovery, N use efficiency). The
   soil-water-nitrate concentration showed large temporal variations in the
   range of 1-150 mg l(-1) for five out of the eight cropping situations,
   while concentrations smaller than 10 mg l(-1) were always recorded in
   the meadows and in one of the four soils (Aeric epiaquept). The
   fertilizer management that characterized each cropping system affected
   the soil-mineral-nitrate content in shallow arable soils. The longer
   soil cover duration in double-cropping systems did not result in a
   reduction of soil N compared to maize as a single crop, not even in
   winter (the bare-soil intercropping period in maize-based systems).
   However, the temporal oscillations of the concentration were buffered by
   the crop cover duration and by the presence of a shallow water table (1
   m deep) in the soil profile. The average nitrate content of the soil
   could be predicted by the N uptake of the crop, the N removal-fertilizer
   ratio, the soil pH and sand content, however no simple explanatory
   relationship was found with the experimental factors. Hence, in farm
   conditions, in the absence of sufficient data for a deterministic model
   approach, the target of reducing the risk of leaching should be achieved
   by maximizing the fertilizer efficiency. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {Variability in foodscapes and fish growth across a habitat mosaic:
   Implications for management and ecosystem restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Riverine ecosystems in their natural state are complex mosaics of
   habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape
   features filter prevailing hydrologic forcing. Yet, through
   anthropogenic alteration many large river systems have become simplified
   through the construction of levees and dams that reduce lateral
   connectivity and flow variability. The extent to which shifts in habitat
   mosaics create conditions that support different trophic responses that
   manifest in differences in fish growth across the landscape remains
   largely untested. This is primarily due to limitations in linking
   habitat features, dynamic physical processes, and trophic transfer of
   energy to higher taxa at the landscape scale. Here, we conducted
   large-scale enclosure experiments across varying habitats on a fluvial
   floodplain as a model system to measure factors that influence
   habitat-specific growth rates in multiple Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha) stocks important to fisheries and of conservation concern.
   Using an ecosystem approach, we reveal that landscape context, water
   residence time, and habitat type (agricultural, wetland, river channel)
   result in different hot-spots of primary and secondary food production.
   This variation in the aquatic foodscape resulted in significant
   variation in salmon growth rates and ultimate size and morphology across
   the landscape. Floodplain habitats generally exhibited higher water
   residence times as highlighted by higher specific conductance, salinity,
   and chlorophyll-a values. Pelagic invertebrate abundance was 10 to 100
   times more abundant in the off-channel habitats compared to the river
   channels. The average daily growth rates of the juvenile Chinook Salmon
   ranged from 0.15 mm day(-1) and 0.01 g day(-1) in the riverine habitat
   to 0.55 mm day(-1) and 0.07 g day(-1) in the off-channel habitat. These
   data were used to build mixed effects models that showed the influence
   of chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature and pelagic
   invertebrate composition on fish growth across locations throughout the
   experiment. As landscapes become increasingly simplified there is
   increased risk of losing the mosaic of habitats necessary to achieve
   enhanced fish growth and phenotypically diverse and sustainable salmon
   populations. This in-situ experimental and modeling approach can be
   applied to other systems to develop ecosystem indicators such as
   habitat-specific fish growth rates to manage landscapes and processes to
   support resilient fish populations.},

Title = {The digestive tract as an essential organ for water acquisition in
   marine teleosts: lessons from euryhaline eels},
Journal = {ZOOLOGICAL LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Adaptation to a hypertonic marine environment is one of the major topics
   in animal physiology research. Marine teleosts lose water osmotically
   from the gills and compensate for this loss by drinking surrounding
   seawater and absorbing water from the intestine. This situation is in
   contrast to that in mammals, which experience a net osmotic loss of
   water after drinking seawater. Water absorption in fishes is made
   possible by (1) removal of monovalent ions (desalinization) by the
   esophagus, (2) removal of divalent ions as carbonate (Mg/CaCO3)
   precipitates promoted by HCO3- secretion, and (3) facilitation of NaCl
   and water absorption from diluted seawater by the intestine using a
   suite of unique transporters. As a result, 70-85\% of ingested seawater
   is absorbed during its passage through the digestive tract. Thus, the
   digestive tract is an essential organ for marine teleost survival in the
   hypertonic seawater environment. The eel is a species that has been
   frequently used for osmoregulation research in laboratories worldwide.
   The eel possesses many advantages as an experimental animal for
   osmoregulation studies, one of which is its outstanding euryhalinity,
   which enables researchers to examine changes in the structure and
   function of the digestive tract after direct transfer from freshwater to
   seawater. In recent years, the molecular mechanisms of ion and water
   transport across epithelial cells (the transcellular route) and through
   tight junctions (the paracellular route) have been elucidated for the
   esophagus and intestine. Thanks to the rapid progress in analytical
   methods for genome databases on teleosts, including the eel, the
   molecular identities of transporters, channels, pumps and junctional
   proteins have been clarified at the isoform level. As 10 y have passed
   since the previous reviews on this subject, it seems relevant and timely
   to summarize recent progress in research on the molecular mechanisms of
   water and ion transport in the digestive tract in eels and to compare
   the mechanisms with those of other teleosts and mammals from comparative
   and evolutionary viewpoints. We also propose future directions for this
   research field to achieve integrative understanding of the role of the
   digestive tract in adaptation to seawater with regard to
   pathways/mechanisms including the paracellular route, divalent ion
   absorption, metabolon formation and cellular trafficking of
   transporters. Notably, some of these have already attracted practical
   attention in laboratories.},

Title = {Nitrate reduction mechanisms and rates in an unconfined eogenetic karst

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {This study integrates push-pull tracer tests (PPTT) with microbial
   characterization of extracted water via quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction (qPCR) and reverse transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) of selected
   functional N transformation genes to quantify nitrate reduction
   mechanisms and rates in sites with different redox potential in a karst
   aquifer. PPTT treatments with nitrate (AN) and nitrate-fumarate (ANC)
   were executed in two wells representing anoxic and oxic geochemical
   end-members. Oxic aquifer zero-order nitrate loss rates (mmolL(-1)h(-1))
   were similar for AN and ANC treatment, ranging from 0.030.01 to
   0.050.01. Anoxic aquifer zero-order nitrate loss rates ranged from
   0.030.02 (AN) to 0.130.02 (ANC). Microbial characterization indicates
   mechanisms influencing these rates were dissimilatory nitrate reduction
   to ammonium (DNRA) at the anoxic site with AN treatment, assimilatory
   reduction of nitrate to ammonium (ANRA) with ANC treatment in the water
   column at both sites, and additional documented nitrate reduction that
   occurred in unsampled biofilms. With carbon treatment, total numbers of
   microbes (16S rRNA genes) significantly increased (fourteenfold to
   thirtyfold), supporting stimulated growth with resulting ANRA. Decreased
   DNRA gene concentrations (nrfA DNA) and increased DNRA activity ratio
   (nrfA-cDNA/DNA) supported the assertion that DNRA occurred in the anoxic
   zone with AN and ANC treatment. Furthermore, decreased DNRA gene copy
   numbers at the anoxic site with ANC treatment suggests that DNRA
   microbes in the anoxic site are chemolithoautotrophic. Increased RT-qPCR
   denitrification gene expression (nirK and nirS) was not observed in
   water samples, supporting that any observed NO3-N loss due to
   denitrification may be occurring in unsampled microbial biofilms.
   Plain Language Summary Nitrate is an abundant contaminant in many
   freshwater aquifers, such as the Upper Floridan Aquifer (UFA). The UFA
   covers approximately 260,000km(2) and provides municipal, industrial,
   and agricultural water supply for a population of 17.9 million people in
   Florida alone. Nitrate concentrations in North Florida springs have been
   increasing. Increased nitrate presents a potential human health hazard
   and may be linked to ecological shifts that increase algae in springs
   and downgradient water bodies such as streams, lakes, and estuaries.
   Increased understanding of what conditions reduce nitrate in the natural
   environment helps water managers evaluate how to best mitigate
   contamination. However, direct estimates of nitrate reduction rates and
   mechanisms in aquifers are limited. This work revealed that nitrate
   reduction pathways are more diverse than previously reported and nitrate
   reduction may be occurring where conditions are presumed to be
   unfavorable. Microbial communities in the aquifer may be converting
   mobile nitrate into immobile ammonium to retain nitrogen for their
   growth. This has significant implications for managing nitrate
   contamination in the UFA, assessing aquifer vulnerability to
   contamination, and protection of sensitive freshwater spring ecosystems.},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {241-269},

Abstract = {Questions: What are the selective landscapes structuring
   inter-population variability on the Haida Gwaii archipelago? How much
   morphological variability is functional given the common potential for
   stochastic founder effects when new habitats are colonized?
   Organism and sites: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from
   56 isolated watersheds with separate marine ancestry encompassing 102
   freshwater localities ranging from large oligotrophic mountain lakes to
   darkly stained bog lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago,
   western Canada.
   Field data: Biophysical attributes of the habitat (lake volume, depth,
   percent light transmission at 400 nm, calcium availability, pH, distance
   to marine waters, predation regime including puncturing, compression,
   and grappling species), morphological traits of the fish (body size,
   body depth, lateral plate number and position, dorsal spine length,
   pelvic girdle size, ascending process height, cross-sectional diameter,
   basal and lateral plate structural overlap), and geographical distance
   between localities. Based on previous surveys in this archipelago, we
   predicted the greatest expression of post-capture defences in lakes with
   high water clarity and the greatest reduction in small stained ponds, as
   this characterizes regular shifts in the predation landscape.
   Analyses: Principal components, univariate linear models, and Akaike
   Information Criterion (AIC) analyses.
   Results: Populations range from 30 to 90 mm in adult male standard
   length, from full-plated to naked, and from full-spined to un-spined.
   Again and again, populations converge towards functional multivariate or
   univariate phenotypes predicted by the biophysical attributes of each
   habitat, primarily lake volume, aquatic spectra, and predation regime.
   Across a broad diversity of lake volumes, body size is larger in stained
   lakes and we hypothesize that this is a defence adaptation for increased
   burst velocity and rapid access to the aphotic zones near the water
   surface. Defence armour is well developed in clear lakes, independent of
   lake volume, and in large stained lakes. Completely plated populations
   are only found in clear habitats. Reduction in posterior plates is
   associated with accentuated armour development in the anterior trunk in
   large lakes where predatory vertebrates are common. Anterior armour,
   including lateral plates and spines, is progressively reduced towards an
   unarmoured condition in shallow, stained ponds.
   Conclusion: Threespine stickleback from pristine lakes and ponds on the
   Haida Gwaii archipelago demonstrate remarkable morphological
   differentiation among populations associated with habitat differences
   that is largely consistent with changes in predation regime, potentially
   mediated through a shift from post-capture to pursuit adaptations. Thus,
   even if founder effects occur when new populations are colonized,
   natural selection is a major determinant of morphological evolution. Our
   study emphasizes the efficacy of selective landscapes in this adaptive
   radiation and provides an opportunity for informed integration of
   emerging genome-wide data of these populations.},

Title = {Endosymbionts of Metazoans Dwelling in the PACManus Hydrothermal Vent:
   Diversity and Potential Adaptive Features Revealed by Genome Analysis},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities are dominated by invertebrates,
   namely, bathymodiolin mussels, siboglinid tubeworms, and provannid
   snails. Symbiosis is considered key to successful colonization by these
   sedentary species in such extreme environments. In the PACManus vent
   fields, snails, tubeworms, and mussels each colonized a niche with
   distinct geochemical characteristics. To better understand the metabolic
   potentials and genomic features contributing to host-environment
   adaptation, we compared the genomes of the symbionts of Bathymodiolus
   manusensis, Arcovestia ivanovi, and Alviniconcha boucheti sampled at
   PACManus, and we discuss their environmentally adaptive features. We
   found that B. manusensis and A. ivanovi are colonized by
   Gammaproteobacteria from distinct clades, whereas endosymbionts of B.
   manusensis feature high intraspecific heterogeneity with differing
   metabolic potentials. A. boucheti harbored three novel
   Epsilonproteobacteria symbionts, suggesting potential species-level
   diversity of snail symbionts. Genome comparisons revealed that the
   relative abundance of gene families related to low-pH homeostasis, metal
   resistance, oxidative stress resistance, environmental
   sensing/responses, and chemotaxis and motility was the highest in A.
   ivanovi's symbiont, followed by symbionts of the vent-mouth-dwelling
   snail A. boucheti, and was relatively low in the symbiont of the
   vent-periphery-dwelling mussel B. manusensis, which is consistent with
   their environmental adaptations and host-symbiont interactions. Gene
   families classified as encoding host interaction/attachment, virulence
   factors/toxins, and eukaryotic-like proteins were most abundant in
   symbionts of mussels and least abundant in those of snails, indicating
   that these symbionts may differ in their host colonization strategies.
   Comparison of Epsilonproteobacteria symbionts to nonsymbionts
   demonstrated that the expanded gene families in symbionts were related
   to vitamin B12 synthesis, toxin-antitoxin systems, methylation, and
   lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, suggesting that these are vital to
   symbiont establishment and development in Epsilonproteobacteria.
   IMPORTANCE Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are dominated by several
   invertebrate species. The establishment of symbiosis has long been
   thought to be the key to successful colonization by these sedentary
   species in such harsh environments. However, the relationships between
   symbiotic bacteria and their hosts and their role in environmental
   adaptations generally remain unclear. In this paper, we show that the
   distribution of three host species showed characteristic niche
   partitioning in the Manus Basin, giving us the opportunity to understand
   how they adapt to their particular habitats. This study also revealed
   three novel genomes of symbionts from the snails of A. boucheti.
   Combined with a data set on other ectosymbiont and free-living bacteria,
   genome comparisons for the snail endosymbionts pointed to several
   genetic traits that may have contributed to the lifestyle shift of
   Epsilonproteobacteria into the epithelial cells. These findings could
   increase our understanding of invertebrate-endosymbiont relationships in
   deep-sea ecosystems.},

Title = {An efficient neuro-evolutionary hybrid modelling mechanism for the

   Australia},

Abstract = {This research paper aims to develop a hybrid neuro-evolutionary
   wrapper-based model for daily global solar radiation estimation in the
   solar-rich Sunshine State of Queensland, Australia. To design a robust
   hybrid modelling mechanism, the Interim-ERA European Centre for Medium
   Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data are employed to train
   and cross-validate the estimation model that is formulated by an
   evolutionary -type algorithm: the Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO)
   integrated with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. The hybrid
   CRO-(ELM) algorithm is applied in two stages: first for the feature
   selection process guided by an ELM algorithm (a class of fast training
   neural network tool) as the model's fitness function to screen an
   optimal set of predictor variables and second, for the estimation of the
   solar radiation using the optimally screened variables by the final
   hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system. To benchmark the performance of the hybrid
   CRO-ELM algorithm for this estimation problem we apply an alternative,
   yet a similar feature screening approach: the Grouping Genetic Algorithm
   encoded into the ELM-based model (GGA-(ELM) used as the predictor
   mechanism). After the feature selection process is performed by the CRO
   algorithm that extracts the data patterns for accurate estimation the
   alternative objective algorithm is applied (in this case the ELM again)
   to formulate the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM modelling system. To provide a
   rigorous evaluation of the CRO-(ELM)ELM hybrid system, alternative
   estimation approaches are considered: the Multivariate Adaptive
   Regression Splines (MARS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the
   Support Vector Regression (SVR). The hybrid CRO(ELM)-ELM system is
   tested in a real problem where the results are evaluated by means of
   several statistical score metrics and diagnostic plots of the observed
   and the estimated daily global solar radiation in the testing phase. We
   show that the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM model is able to yield promising
   results; thus improving those attained by the 7 alternative models
   (i.e., hybrid CRO-(ELM)-MARS, CRO-(ELM)-MLR and CRO-(ELM)-SVR and the
   GGA equivalent models). The study ascertains that the CRO-based hybrid
   system where a large pool of predictor data are carefully screened
   through a wrapper-based modelling system and the ELM model is applied as
   a objective estimation tool can be adopted as a qualified stratagem in
   solar radiation estimation problems. The proposed hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM
   system exhibits clear advantages over the alternative machine learning
   approaches tested and also over the other machine learning algorithms
   used without the feature selection tool; thus advocating its scientific
   utility in renewable energy applications.},

Title = {Predictive Analytics for Identifying Land Cover Change Hotspots in the

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Understanding land cover change dynamics and potential pathways of
   change is of critical importance for sustainable resource management, to
   promote food security and resilience on a range of spatial scales. Data
   scarcity is a key concern, however, with the availability of free Earth
   Observation (EO) data, such challenges can be suitably addressed. In
   this research we have developed a robust machine learning (random
   forest) approach utilizing EO and Geographic Information System (GIS)
   data, which enables an innovative means for our simulations to be driven
   only by historical drivers of change and hotspot prediction based on
   probability to change. We used the Mekong region as a case study to
   generate a training and validation sample from historical land cover
   patterns of change and used this information to train a random forest
   machine learning model. Data samples were created from the SERVIR-Mekong
   land cover data series. Data sets were created for 2 categories both
   containing 8 classes. The 2 categories included-any generic class to
   change into a specific one and vice versa. Classes included the
   following: Aquaculture; Barren; Cropland; Flooded Forest; Mangroves;
   Forest; Plantations; Wetlands; and Urban. The training points were used
   to sample a series of satellite-derived surface reflectance products and
   other data layers such as information on slope, distance to road and
   census data, which represent the drivers of change. The classifier was
   trained in binary mode and showed a clear separation between change and
   no change. An independent validation dataset of historical change pixels
   show that all median change probabilities are greater than 80\% and all
   lower quantiles, except one, are greater than 70\%. The 2018 probability
   change maps show high probabilities for the Plantations and Forest
   classes in the `Generic to Specific' and `Specific to generic' category,
   respectively. A time-series analysis of change probability shows that
   forests have become more likely to convert into other classes during the
   last two decades, across all countries. We successfully demonstrated
   that historical change patters combined with big data and machine
   learning technologies are powerful tools for predictive change analytics
   on a planetary scale.},

Title = {Vertical Line Requirements and North Atlantic Right Whale Entanglement
   Risk Reduction for the Gulf of Maine American Lobster Fishery},
Journal = {MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the U.S. western Atlantic Ocean, North Atlantic right whales
   Eubalaena glacialis are subject to gear entanglement in fixed-gear
   vertical line fisheries, with mortality risk increasing with line
   strength and spatial density. U.S. federal management agencies have
   mandated vertical line strength limits (235.033-kg-m {[}1,700-ft-lb]
   breaking strength) to curtail the injury and mortality risk that
   entanglement poses to right whales. Limiting the strength of vertical
   lines used in the trap fishery for American lobster Homarus americanus,
   however, could negatively impact the economic resilience of New England
   fishing communities if it forces the purchase of new equipment or
   increases the incidence of break-offs and lost gear. We provide a novel
   look at the spatially distinct vertical line strength requirements for
   the Maine American lobster trap fishery. The hauling load requirements
   of the fishery were modeled using measurements of strain put on vertical
   lines used in typical lobster trap operations to determine the minimum
   strength necessary to fish safely and avoid dangerous line breaks. New
   regulations on minimum trawl lengths (number of traps fished per
   vertical line) taking effect in 2022 will cause increases in lobster
   fishery vertical line loads across all fishing grounds, considerably
   increasing with depth and distance from shore. Our models indicated that
   inshore areas can be safely fished with vertical lines within the
   recommended whale-safe 235.033-kg-m (1,700-ft-lb) breaking strength
   specification, whereas the offshore lobster fishery will need a suite of

Title = {Behavioral Avoidance Response of Daphnia to Fungal Infection Caused by
   Metschnikowia Species in a Temperate Reservoir},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The negative effects of fungal infection on the survival
   and reproduction of cladocerans, a representative prey community in
   freshwater, are unexplored. In this study, we hypothesized that the
   winter migration pattern of Daphnia pulicaria, observed in the Anri
   Reservoir in South Korea, is the host's defense response to fungal
   infection. Daphnia pulicaria was mainly distributed in the central
   bottom layer of the reservoir before winter (summer to autumn) but
   migrated to the littoral area during winter as fungal infections in the
   communities gradually spread in the bottom region. However, when the
   spread of infection was low, D. pulicaria did not migrate. The migrated
   individuals with dormant eggs were mostly infected and are believed to
   have migrated to the littoral area to freeze their dormant eggs. We
   found that dormant eggs of D. pulicaria obtained from ice crystals had
   lower hatching and infection rates than dormant eggs obtained adaptively
   in Daphnia mothers. Such a strategy is an efficient response of D.
   pulicaria to avoid the spread of fungal infection in communities and to
   maintain their continuous population growth. Morphological or behavioral
   defense mechanisms are important evolutionary strategies for the
   survival of prey. Studies have focused on predation and competition, but
   infection has been overlooked, despite being a determining factor of
   distribution and species diversity of prey. We hypothesized that the
   winter migration of Daphnia pulicaria is a community defense strategy to
   avoid fungal infection. To test this hypothesis, environmental variables
   and the Cladocera community, including D. pulicaria, were monitored in
   three study sections of the Anri Reservoir in the Republic of Korea
   during September 2010-August 2015. During three winter seasons, the
   density of infected D. pulicaria increased in all study sections, and
   they migrated from the central to the littoral area. Most of the
   infected individuals had dormant eggs in sexually reproducing mothers.
   However, when the proportion of non-infected individuals was higher than
   that of infected individuals, winter migration was not observed.
   Additional microcosm experiments showed that dormant eggs of D.
   pulicaria obtained from ice crystals in the littoral area had lower
   hatching and infection rates than those obtained from mothers moving
   from other zones. Therefore, the migration of D. pulicaria during winter
   is an active response to avoid intergenerational fungal infection.},

Title = {A very-high resolution (20m) measurement-based dust emissions and
   dispersion modeling approach for the Oceano Dunes, California},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {218},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {This study shows the results from very high-resolution (20 m) dust
   emissions and transport simulations for the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular
   Recreation Area (ODSVRA), a coastal sand dune complex located in San
   Luis Obispo County, California. Field data from an enhanced observation
   period carried out in May-July 2013 helped estimate the emissions and
   flow conditions over the dune field. Emissions are based on a
   comprehensive emissions grid developed from in-situ measurements using
   the Portable In-Situ Wind ERosion Lab (PI-SWERL). PI-SWERL estimates the
   potential for a soil surface to produce PM ic , dust emissions for a
   range of wind speeds. This approach provided a well-determined PM10
   emissions field as a function of time and space. Wind and turbulence
   fields were estimated using the CALMET diagnostic meteorological model
   constrained with surface stations, upper air soundings, buoys, and the
   North American Reanalysis data. Hourly, three-dimensional wind flow and
   instability objective analysis fields were developed at 20 m resolution
   in order to consider the complex flow over realistic dune morphology,
   land use/land cover and terrain characteristics over and around the
   Oceano Dunes. The dust dispersion simulations were performed using a
   computationally efficient and vectorized Lagrangian Stochastic Particle
   Dispersion Model driven by the CALMET output and the PI-SWERL time-space
   variable emissions. The dispersion model is based on the Langevin
   formulation and includes the turbulent diffusion and stochastic particle
   motion (of millions of particles) in the inertial sub-range, and
   assuming particles as discrete units neglecting deposition. The model
   estimates diffusion of particles from an initial particle releases that
   scale according to the PI-SWERL time-variable emissions estimates.
   Results were then tested at two independent-downwind locations, with
   positive correlations for flow conditions (R-2 = 0.89) and similar
   receptor PM10 concentrations (R-2 = 0.85). Evaluations against those
   observations during mean flow conditions as well as for elevated dust
   events suggest that the model framework can capture the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of mean day-to-day and diurnal PM10
   variability. In this study we describe the details of the model
   framework and its performance as well as its implementation to locate
   the dust sources that have the strongest impact in the receptor sites
   and to evaluate the impact of different dust reduction strategies used
   at the ODSVRA to mitigate PM10 at downwind receptors.},

Abstract = {The main purpose with this review is to summarise present research on
   the microbiology of deep subterranean environments, deeper than 50-100
   m. Included are mainly studies where drilling, excavation, core sampling
   and ground water sampling have been made for research. Studies done in
   environments penetrated for commercial purposes, such as water wells,
   mining, oil recovery etc., have been dismissed because of the obvious
   risk for contamination during the penetration. Different measures that
   can be applied to reduce the risk of microbial contamination of sampled
   specimens by the access operations are discussed. The requirement for
   reliable estimations of the present microbial biomass, its activity and
   diversity in subterranean ecosystems, is fundamental. An array of
   different methods to achieve this goal are presented. The depth limit
   for subterranean life is suggested to be set by temperature, provided
   there is energy available for microbial life. If so, it should be
   possible to enrich thermophilic bacteria from deep hot ground waters
   which also has been done. There are only a few sites where the
   subterranean microbiology has been studied in multidisiplinary programs
   including chemistry and geology. The two most extensively published
   sites are the sediments of the Atlantic coastal plain of South Carolina,
   USA, studied in a subsurface program, initiated and sponsored by the
   U.S. Department of Energy, and crystalline bed-rock in Sweden studied in
   a program concerning the safety of future underground repositories for
   nuclear waste.
   This review presents an array of independent reports suggesting that
   microbial life is widespread at depth in the crust of earth-the deep
   subterranean biosphere. The obvious consequence is that microbes may be
   involved in many subterranean geochemical processes, such as diagenesis,
   weathering, precipitation, and in oxidation or reduction reactions of
   metals, carbon, nitrogen and sulfur-just as they are in most terranean
   environments.},

Title = {When the waters recede: the economic impact of tsunamis in the
   Graeco-Roman world},
Journal = {REVUE BELGE DE PHILOLOGIE ET D HISTOIRE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-68},
Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of ancient tsunamis on the ancient
   World. Nowadays, the effects of such events on contemporary economic is
   easy to assess and investigate, thanks to the amount of information
   available. More complicated is the picture for pre-modem societies.
   The aim of this paper is precisely to focus on the economic
   consequences, if any, of tidal waves on certain regions and periods of
   the classical world.
   As a matter of fact, the study of natural disasters has been a popular
   topic for modem scholarship of the Antiquity. Along the Mediterranean
   basin, ancient tsunamis usually devastated regions with high levels of
   seismic activity, such as the Balkans, the South-East, the Levant or the
   central and eastern islands. Most of the archaeological evidence from
   tsunamis and earthquakes, however, has been mixed up by a combination of
   geological and human activity, making it difficult to single out which
   is which. Tsunamis were less frequent than earthquakes but their impact
   on human communities and their available natural resources could have
   been more catastrophic, at least in the short-term. The unexpected
   nature of such tidal waves surely produced considerable unrest within
   the affected population, who might have been familiar with the
   devastating effects of earthquakes but most probably were unaware of
   such a rare natural phenomenon. Our main goal, however, is to ascertain
   the economic impact of ancient tsunamis on the `longue-duree'.
   The article is composed of two main parts. In the first one, we examine
   the evidence for tsunamis occurred in the Mediterranean basins from
   fifth century BC till the fourth AD, before the great tsunami of AD 365.
   It is possible to recognize how the Graeco-Roman literature describes,
   in some cases with remarkable accuracy, the basic functioning of what
   geologists know as tsunamis, but generally fails to provide any
   information on the economic impact of them on the ancient societies.
   In the second part, we focus on the tsunami of AD 365, for which we have
   more information, provided by both literary and documentary evidence,
   allowing us to use it as an interesting case study with a particular
   relevance in the ancient history. The final conclusion is that tsunamis
   in antiquity, as far as it is possible to infer from the status of our
   sources, despite having probably a huge damaging effect on the economy
   on the short term, usually did not affect it on the `longue-duree',
   given, most likely, to efficient policies devised by ancient
   civilizations, to cope with such events.},

   Neighbourhood Scale},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},

Abstract = {The spatial composition and configuration of land use land cover (LULC)
   in the urban landscape impact the land surface temperature (LST). In
   this study, we assessed such impacts at the neighbourhood level of the
   City of Edmonton. In doing so, we employed Landsat-8 Operational Land
   Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensors (TIRS) satellite images to
   derive LULC and LST maps, respectively. We used three classification
   methods, such as ISODATA, random forest, and indices-based, for mapping
   LULC classes including built-up, water, and green. We obtained the
   highest overall accuracy of 98.53 and 97.90\% with a kappa value of 0.96
   and 0.92 in the indices-based method for the 2018 and 2015 LULC maps,
   respectively. Besides, we estimated the LST map from the brightness
   temperature using a single-channel algorithm. Our analysis showed that
   the highest contributors to LST were the industrial (303.51 K in 2018
   and 295.99 K in 2015) and residential (303.47 K in 2018 and 296.56 K in
   2015) neighbourhoods, and the lowest contributor was the riverine/creek
   (298.77 K in 2018 and 292.89 K in 2015) during the 2018 late summer and
   2015 early spring seasons. We also found that the residential
   neighbourhoods exhibited higher LST in comparison with the industrial
   with the same LULC composition. The result was also supported by our
   surface albedo analysis, where industrial and residential neighbourhoods
   were giving higher and lower albedo values, respectively. This indicated
   that the rooftop materials played further role in impacting the LST. In
   addition, our spatial autocorrelation (local Moran'sI) and proximity
   (near distance) analyses revealed that the structural configurations
   would additionally play an important role in contributing to the LST in
   the neighbourhoods. For example, the cluster pattern with a small gap of
   minimum 2.4 m between structures in the residential neighbourhoods were
   showing higher LST in compared with the sparse pattern, with large gaps
   between structures in the industrial areas. The wide passages for wind
   flow through the large gaps would be responsible for cooling the LST in
   the industrial neighbourhoods. The outcomes of this study would help
   planners in planning and designing urban neighbourhoods, and
   policymakers and stakeholders in developing strategies to balance
   surface energy and mitigate local warming.},

Title = {Functional trait-based layers - an aquaculture siting tool for the
   Mediterranean Sea},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {532},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Aquaculture, the current fastest-growing food sector, is one of the
   major opportunities that could be reaped to cope with the increased
   demand for proteins from the sea and simultaneously generate economic
   growth while ensuring sustainable use of natural resources. The number
   of tools and approaches suggested to promote the selection of suitable
   areas focusing mostly on the management of potential conflicting uses at
   sea is rapidly increasing. However, to date, there is a lack of
   information regarding spatial planning according to a trait-based
   approach encompassing the functional and biological data of farmed
   species; a gap that may lead to selecting unsuitable areas for farming.
   To fill this gap, our study builds on a functional trait-based
   mechanistic approach based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory
   allowing to generated species and site-specific predictions of
   aquaculture performances and the related environmental impact. We
   applied this approach to a commercial species farmed in the
   Mediterranean Sea, namely, the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax).
   We used three seeding sizes (1.5, 2, 2.5 g) to run model simulations and
   answer a crucial question for farm management, i.e. the selection of the
   best seeding size. A sensitivity analysis coupled with our simulations
   allowed to spatially represent the performance growth and environmental
   impact per seeding size across Mediterranean countries. The accuracy of
   the model's outcome was strengthened by using high-resolution satellite
   data over a wide area of investigation (c.a. 302,000 km(2)). The novel
   informative obtained layers combine both the modelling of aqua culture
   performance and related environmental impact to fill a lacking
   perspective within both AZAs (Allocated Zones for Aquaculture) and AZEs
   (Allowable Zones of Effect) concepts. Our approach allowed
   discriminating the best zones for European sea bass aquaculture at
   country level for each of the tested seeding sizes. High-resolution
   predictions of aquaculture performances and impact were provided for
   each of the nineteen Mediterranean coastal countries, zooming at
   Exclusive Economic Zone scale (EEZ). We highlighted pole-ward negative
   patterns with the best values in the Southern basin; Libya, Tunisia and
   Egypt in particular. Our spatial contextualization through high
   resolution mapped outcomes represents an effective and salient tool for
   stakeholders and policy makers, based on the translation of complex
   computational modelling results into easy-to-read maps. The highlighted
   patterns may provide scientific evidence for proactive capacity-building
   programmes at country level in the future.},

Title = {WHY MARINE MAMMALS MATTER TO YOUR TERRESTRIAL EXPORT PIPELINE PROJECT},
Booktitle = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL PIPELINE CONFERENCE - 2014, VOL 1},
Year = {2014},
Note = {10th International Pipeline Conference, Calgary, CANADA, SEP 29-OCT 03,
   2014},
Abstract = {Increases in export pipeline development can result in a corresponding
   increase in marine transportation activities and the potential to
   escalate adverse interactions with marine wildlife. Ship traffic
   introduces risks of vessel strikes as well as the amount of underwater
   noise produced in the marine environment. Growing public and scientific
   concern over the potential effects of increasing ship traffic on marine
   wildlife mean that even terrestrially-based pipeline projects need to
   start considering the effects of shipping in developing environmental
   mitigation programs for their export operations. Northern Gateway is
   proposing to construct and operate twin pipelines between Alberta and
   British Columbia, and an associated tank and marine terminal for export
   operations. While Northern Gateway will not own or operate any of the
   tankers, they have committed to implementing a comprehensive marine
   mitigation, monitoring and research program, including measures to
   reduce ship strikes and effects of underwater noise on marine mammals.
   Vessel strikes can cause severe or fatal injuries. Higher relative
   risk,exists where shipping traffic overlaps with increased densities of
   marine mammals. Vessel speed has been positively correlated with the
   degree of risk and injury; consequently, Northern Gateway has set
   maximum year-round speed restrictions of 10-12 knots for all
   Project-related tankers calling at the marine terminal, with further
   restrictions of 8-10 knots in key areas. Other large vessels in this
   region currently travel at speeds of 16-21 knots. Mandatory speed
   restrictions will also reduce the Project's contribution to underwater
   noise. Effects of underwater noise on marine mammals include temporary
   habitat avoidance, reduced feeding efficiency, behavioural change,
   increased stress, and communication masking. Acoustic modeling conducted
   for the project predicted that reducing vessel speeds from 15 to 9.6
   knots would decrease underwater noise input by nearly 12 dB, making the
   zone of ensonification 2-3 times smaller than in the absence of
   mitigations. Purpose-built escort tugs will use best
   commercially-available noise-quieting technology and speed restriction
   areas will be refined through six-years of surveys and a quantitative
   vessel strike analysis. Vessel traffic is not unique to Northern
   Gateway; however, through minimizing their incremental contribution,
   they hope to serve as an industry example. This approach to minimizing
   effects of routine marine export operations is unique in the shipping
   industry in Canada and the United States. If other proponents were to
   adopt similar types of measures, Northern Gateway believes that the
   marine environment would see some net benefits in terms of a reduction
   in adverse effects on marine mammals.},

Title = {Rapid extraction of total lipids and lipophilic POPs from all
   EU-regulated foods of animal origin: Smedes' method revisited and
   enhanced},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Background Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins,
   dioxin-like chemicals and non-dioxin-like PCBs causing adverse effects
   to human health bio-accumulate through the food web due to their
   affinity for adipose tissues. Foods of animal origin are therefore the
   main contributors to human dietary exposure. The European Union's (EU)
   food safety policy requires checking of a wide range of samples for
   compliance with legal limits on a regular basis. Several methods of
   varying efficiency are applied by official control laboratories for
   extraction of the different classes of lipids and associated POPs, bound
   to animal tissue and animal products in varying degrees, sometimes
   leading to discrepancies especially in fresh weight based analytical
   results. Results Starting fromSmedes'lipid extraction from marine
   tissue, we optimized the extraction efficiency for both lipids and
   lipophilic pollutants, abandoning the time-consuming centrifugation
   step. The resulting modifiedSmedesextraction (MSE) method was validated
   based on multiple analyses of a large number of real-world samples,
   matrix calibration and performance assessment in proficiency testing
   utilizing both instrumental and bioanalytical methodologies.
   Intermediate precision in 12 different foods was below 3\% in chicken
   eggs, egg powder, animal fat, fish, fish oil, poultry, whole milk, milk
   fat and milk powder, and below 5\% in bovine meat, liver, and infant
   food. In comparison toTwisselmannhot extraction, results presented here
   show an increased efficiency of MSE by + 25\% for bovine liver, + 14\%
   for chicken eggs, + 13\% for poultry meat, + 12\% for fish, 8\% for
   bovine meat, and 6\% for infant food. Conclusions For the first time, a
   fast and reliable routine method is available that enables the analyst
   to reproducibly extract ``total{''} lipids from any EU-regulated food
   sample of animal origin within 6 to 8 min. Increased efficiency
   translates into a considerable increase in both lipid and wet
   weight-based analytical results measured for associated POPs, reducing
   the risk of false non-compliant results. Compared to a 4
   hTwisselmannextraction, the extraction of 1000 samples using MSE would
   result in annual savings of about 250 h or 32 working days. Our MSE
   procedure contributes to the European Commission's objective of
   harmonizing analytical results across the EU generated according to
   Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/644.},

Title = {Implications for the seafood industry, consumers and the environment
   arising from contamination of shellfish with pharmaceuticals, plastics
   and potentially toxic elements: A case study from Irish waters with a
   global orientation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {844},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Shellfish are a rich source of minerals, B-vitamins and omega-3 to the
   human diet. The global population is expected to reach 9.6 billion
   people by 2050 where there will be increased demand for shellfish and
   for sustained improvements in harvesting. The production of most
   consumed species of shellfish is sea-based and are thus susceptible to
   in situ environmental conditions and water quality. Population growth
   has contributed to expansion of urbanization and the generation of
   effluent and waste that reaches aquatic environments, potentially
   contaminating seafood by expo-sure to non-treated effluents or
   inappropriately discarded waste. Environmental contaminants as
   microplastics (MP), pharmaceuticals (PHAR) and potentially toxic
   contaminants (PTE) are being identified in all trophic levels and are a
   current threat to both shellfish and consumer safety. Immunotoxicity,
   genotoxicity, fertility reduction, mor-tality and bioaccumulation of PTE
   are representative examples of the variety of effects already
   established in contam-inated shellfish. In humans, the consumption of
   contaminated shellfish can lead to neurological and developmental
   effects, reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders and in extreme
   cases, death. This timely review provides insights into the presence of
   MP, PHAR and PTE in shellfish, and estimate the daily intake and hazard
   quotient for consumption behaviours. Alternatives approaches for seafood
   depuration that encompass risk reduction are addressed, to reflect state
   of the art knowledge from a Republic of Ireland perspective. Review of
   best-published literature revealed that MP, PHAR and PTE contaminants
   were detected in commercialised species of shellfish, such as
   Crassostrea and Mytilus. The ability to accumulate these contaminants by
   shellfish due to feeding characteristics is attested by extensive in
   vitro studies. However, there is lack of knowledge surrounding the
   distribution of these contaminants in the aquatic envi-ronment their
   interactions with humans. Preventive approaches including risk
   assessment are necessary to safeguard the shellfish industry and the
   consumer.},

Title = {Benefits of migration in relation to nutritional condition and predation
   risk in a partially migratory moose population},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {225-237},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The costs and benefits of alternative migratory strategies are often
   framed in the context of top-down and bottom-up effects on individual
   fitness. This occurs because migration is considered a costly behavioral
   strategy that presumably confers explicit benefits to migrants in the
   form of either decreased predation risk (predation risk avoidance
   hypothesis) or increased nutrition (forage maturation hypothesis). To
   test these hypotheses, we studied a partially migratory moose (Alces
   alces) population and contrasted explicit measures of predation risk
   (i.e., offspring survival) and nutrition (i.e., accumulation of
   endogenous energy reserves) between resident and migratory
   subpopulations. We relied on data collected from migratory and
   nonmigratory radio-marked moose (n = 67) that inhabited a novel study
   system located in coastal Alaska between 2004 and 2010. In this area,
   30\% of the population resides year-round on a coastal foreland area,
   while 48\% migrate to either a small island archipelago or a subalpine
   ridge system (the remainder exhibited one of six different
   low-occurrence strategies). Overall, we determined that accumulation of
   body fat during the growing season did not differ between migratory or
   resident modalities. However, calf survival was 2.6-2.9 times higher for
   individuals that migrated (survival, islands = 0.49 +/- 0.16 {[}mean +/-
   SE], n = 35; ridge = 0.52 +/- 0.16, n = 33) than those that did not
   (survival, resident = 0.19 +/- 0.08, n = 57). Our results support the
   predation risk avoidance hypotheses, and suggest that migration is a
   behavioral strategy that principally operates to reduce the risk of calf
   predation and does not confer explicit nutritional benefits. We did not
   directly detect trade-offs between predation risk and nutrition for
   migratory individuals. Yet we identify an indirect life history
   mechanism that may mildly dampen the apparent fitness benefits of
   migration. The proximate factors accounting for differences in
   migration-specific neonate survival are likely linked to accessibility
   of refugial habitats for moose at local and landscape scales, landscape
   factors that affect hunting efficacy of large carnivores, and
   interactions with rural human communities. Conservation of ungulate
   populations can be aided by integrating knowledge about migratory
   behavior, life history strategies, and factors that alter ungulate
   vulnerability, particularly those induced by human activity.},

Title = {Capture-based enrichment of Theileria parva DNA enables full genome
   assembly of first buffalo-derived strain and reveals exceptional
   intra-specific genetic diversity},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Theileria parva is an economically important, intracellular,
   tick-transmitted parasite of cattle. A live vaccine against the parasite
   is effective against challenge from cattle-transmissible T. parva but
   not against genotypes originating from the African Cape buffalo, a major
   wildlife reservoir, prompting the need to characterize genome-wide
   variation within and between cattle- and buffalo-associated T. parva
   populations. Here, we describe a capture-based target enrichment
   approach that enables, for the first time, de novo assembly of nearly
   complete T. parva genomes derived from infected host cell lines. This
   approach has exceptionally high specificity and sensitivity and is
   successful for both cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva parasites. De
   novo genome assemblies generated for cattle genotypes differ from the
   reference by similar to 54K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   throughout the 8.31 Mb genome, an average of 6.5 SNPs/kb. We report the
   first buffalo-derived T. parva genome, which is similar to 20 kb larger
   than the genome from the reference, cattle-derived, Muguga strain, and
   contains 25 new potential genes. The average non-synonymous nucleotide
   diversity (pi(N)) per gene, between buffalo-derived T. parva and the
   Muguga strain, was 1.3\%. This remarkably high level of genetic
   divergence is supported by an average Wright's fixation index (F-ST),
   genome-wide, of 0.44, reflecting a degree of genetic differentiation
   between cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva parasites more commonly
   seen between, rather than within, species. These findings present clear
   implications for vaccine development, further demonstrated by the
   ability to assemble nearly all known antigens in the buffalo-derived
   strain, which will be critical in design of next generation vaccines.
   The DNA capture approach used provides a clear advantage in specificity
   over alternative T. parva DNA enrichment methods used previously, such
   as those that utilize schizont purification, is less labor intensive,
   and enables in-depth comparative genomics in this apicomplexan parasite.
   Author summary
   An estimated 50 million cattle in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of the
   deadly livestock disease East coast fever (ECF), caused by the parasite
   Theileria parva, which imposes tremendous economic hardship on
   smallholder farmers. An existing ECF vaccine protects against strains
   circulating among cattle, but not against T. parva derived from African
   Cape buffalo, its main wildlife carrier. Understanding this difference
   in protective efficacy requires characterization of the genetic
   diversity in T. parva strains associated with each mammalian host, a
   goal that has been hindered by the proliferation of T. parva in
   nucleated host cells, with much larger genomes. Here we adapted a
   sequence capture approach to target the whole parasite genome, enabling
   enrichment of parasite DNA over that of the host. Choices in protocol
   development resulted in nearly 100\% parasite genome specificity and
   sensitivity, making this approach the most successful yet to generate T.
   parva genome sequence data in a high-throughput manner. The analyses
   uncovered a degree of genetic differentiation between cattle- and
   buffalo-derived genotypes that is akin to levels more commonly seen

Abstract = {In the aeronautic industry, some research is currently carried out to
   improve pilot seating and lying comfort, as well as cockpit ergonomics
   and accessibility. Pilots spend indeed a lot of time on their seat
   during a flight. If seats are uncomfortable and pilots are in a wrong
   posture, risks of injuries and fatigue increase a lot. But taking into
   account these comfort requirements for the pilot seat and the cockpit
   design is very challenging. In fact, the very strict aeronautics
   standards for certification may sometimes jeopardize initial design
   ambitions regarding comfort. The necessary innovations to address
   certification and comfort cannot rely on a classical trial-and-error
   approach on real prototypes with human volunteers. This way of working
   presents several disadvantages related to test repeatability and human
   subjectivity. From one real test to another, volunteers' morphology,
   posture and mood may change and sometimes do not represent the range of
   possible occupants. In addition, as tests happen late in the development
   process, at a time where there are limited possibilities to improve the
   seat and cockpit designs, or propose radically innovative solutions, it
   becomes very complicated for engineers to reach their initial
   objectives. To avoid these issues related to real tests, OEMs and
   suppliers are beginning to change their development process to adopt
   alternative ways to iterate earlier in the conception phase. In the
   scope of a project on pilot cabin development, done with Dassault
   Aviation, Safran and ESI Group, a tool dedicated to aircraft pilot seat
   virtual prototyping has been developed to integrate earlier in the
   industrial process comfort aspects and seat integration inside the
   cockpit. It has been adapted from ESI's Virtual Seat Solution already
   used in the automotive industry. This paper will describe an application
   of this virtual prototyping on industrial examples and how designers can
   virtually create a seat model right from the early design phases and
   start assessing its performances. Seating simulations of human models
   have been performed to evaluate static and postural comfort. Those
   simulations can be then extended to address, in a second step, other
   performances such as vibratory or thermal comfort, or static comfort for
   a different seat adjustment such as the reclined posture. Finally, these
   results have been compared to real measurements to give some insights
   into the predictivity of ESI Seat and Interior Solutions.},

Title = {Offshore Oil Slick Detection: From Photo-Interpreter to Explainable
   Multi-Modal Deep Learning Models Using SAR Images and Contextual Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ocean surface monitoring, emphasizing oil slick detection, has become
   essential due to its importance for oil exploration and ecosystem risk
   prevention. Automation is now mandatory since the manual annotation
   process of oil by photo-interpreters is time-consuming and cannot
   process the data collected continuously by the available spaceborne
   sensors. Studies on automatic detection methods mainly focus on
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data exclusively to detect anthropogenic
   (spills) or natural (seeps) oil slicks, all using limited datasets. The
   main goal is to maximize the detection of oil slicks of both natures
   while being robust to other phenomena that generate false alarms, called
   ``lookalikes{''}. To this end, this paper presents the automation of
   offshore oil slick detection on an extensive database of real and recent
   oil slick monitoring scenarios, including both types of slicks. It
   relies on slick annotations performed by expert photo-interpreters on
   Sentinel-1 SAR data over four years and three areas worldwide. In
   addition, contextual data such as wind estimates and infrastructure
   positions are included in the database as they are relevant data for oil
   detection. The contributions of this paper are: (i) A comparative study
   of deep learning approaches using SAR data. A semantic and instance
   segmentation analysis via FC-DenseNet and Mask R-CNN, respectively. (ii)
   A proposal for Fuse-FC-DenseNet, an extension of FC-DenseNet that fuses
   heterogeneous SAR and wind speed data for enhanced oil slick
   segmentation. (iii) An improved set of evaluation metrics dedicated to
   the task that considers contextual information. (iv) A visual
   explanation of deep learning predictions based on the SHapley Additive
   exPlanation (SHAP) method adapted to semantic segmentation. The proposed
   approach yields a detection performance of up to 94\% of good detection
   with a false alarm reduction ranging from 14\% to 34\% compared to
   mono-modal models. These results provide new solutions to improve the
   detection of natural and anthropogenic oil slicks by providing tools
   that allow photo-interpreters to work more efficiently on a wide range
   of marine surfaces to be monitored worldwide. Such a tool will
   accelerate the oil slick detection task to keep up with the continuous
   sensor acquisition. This upstream work will allow us to study its
   possible integration into an industrial production pipeline. In
   addition, a prediction explanation is proposed, which can be integrated
   as a step to identify the appropriate methodology for presenting the
   predictions to the experts and understanding the obtained predictions
   and their sensitivity to contextual information. Thus it helps them to
   optimize their way of working.},

Title = {Bioenergetics of the common seastar Asterias rubens: a keystone predator
   and pest for European bivalve culture},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Losses due to predation are recognized as an important factor affecting
   shellfish stocks, restoration efforts and aquaculture production.
   Managing and mitigating the impact of predators require information on
   the population dynamics and functional responses to prey availability
   under varying environmental conditions. Asterias spp. are well-known
   keystone predators with the capacity to exert a top down control on
   shellfish populations. Asterias spp. populations are extremely plastic,
   booming fast when prey is abundant and exhibiting a remarkable
   individual resilience to starvation and adverse environmental
   conditions. These aspects have led Asterias spp. to be considered pests
   by shellfish producers and fishers and to be catalogued among the most
   devastating invasive species. Assessment and mitigation of the impact of
   Asterias rubens in northern Europe have been the objective of several
   projects. However, there is still a limited understanding of the
   processes behind A. rubens population plasticity and how environmental
   conditions affect individual growth and predation. Under these
   circumstances a comprehensive eco-physiological model becomes necessary.
   These models can integrate available information on biology and
   eco-physiology to gain understanding of the effect of the environmental
   conditions on the impact of A. rubens. In this work, we performed a
   number of eco-physiological experiments and combined them with field
   data from a Danish estuary to estimate and validate the parameters of a
   dynamic energy budget (DEB) model for the whole life cycle of A. rubens.
   DEB models can be used to assess the effects of environmental
   variability on the life cycle and key population traits allowing the
   prediction of the performance, abundance, resource requirements and
   potential distribution of individuals and populations under dynamic
   environments. As such the DEB model presented in this study aims to
   become a tool to be used to assess and manage the impact of A. rubens in
   cultured and natural shellfish populations. The successfully
   parameterised DEB model describes A. rubens as a plastic species, an
   efficient predator with low maintenance costs and, at least while
   feeding on mussels, a high energy yield from its prey. The model
   validation against independent data resulted in the model being capable
   to assess growth, food demand, reproductive output and reserves dynamics
   of A. rubens under experimental and natural conditions. Moreover,
   application of the model to the Limfjorden seastar fishery is used to
   further discuss the use of the model to understand biology and ecology
   of this pest species in the context with the management of shellfish
   stocks and impact mitigation.},

Abstract = {This paper outlines research and design for housing rural-to-urban
   migrants inViet Nam, focused on Da Nang City. Global capital flow in
   primary economic segments - manufacturing, services, and tourism have
   infused developing countries with new knowledge and capital. Global
   forces produce internal migration in developing nations given the
   transition from agricultural to industrial and service economies. Around
   7 million Vietnamese are expected to relocate to urban areas by 2019 to
   seek entry-level employment in the industrial or service sectors, and
   will be challenged to afford housing meeting minimum standards. Also,
   Viet Nam's population is concentrated in low-lying coastal areas
   vulnerable to storm surge and tropical cyclones. Finding a solution to
   housing urban immigrants is critical to stabilize and grow the economy.
   This entails managing the movement, health, and welfare of people and
   minimizing out of country migration. In response, the Vietnamese
   government is implementing sustainable and resilience initiatives, and
   has a low interest loans program to encourage apartment ownership for
   qualifying individuals.
   The research sought design solutions for affordable, sustainable, and
   resilient housing for Viet Nam's urban immigrant workforce. The authors
   led research conducted in summer 2014 under the auspices of a Fulbright
   Specialist Grant in Urban Planning at Da Nang University of Science and
   Technology (DUT) involving a team of DUT lecturers and students. The
   team first researched and documented the development of Vietnamese urban
   infrastructure, planning, housing, and construction. Research on extant
   affordable housing indicated most were lacking in addressing basic needs
   of thermal comfort, sanitation, floor area, and social spaces. From
   these findings, design criteria were formulated, including: (a)
   Affordability - land, construction, energy, and maintenance cost; (b)
   Sustainability - embodied energy, passive shading and cooling systems,
   water re-use, and urban farming; (c) Resilience - structural integrity,
   water resistance, elevated floor levels, and protected building systems;
   and (d) Social Needs - community spaces, urban amenities, and unit types
   addressing varied family types.
   A prototype housing block was designed incorporating the identified
   design criteria. A site was selected in Da Nang's primary industrial
   zone comprised of 395 hectares, 10 km northwest of the city center, that
   includes factory, warehouse, school, park, commercial, and housing uses.
   Housing blocks are subdivided into 5mx20m parcels intended for medium
   density row house development accommodating multi-generational family
   living. The prototype housing block structural bays conformed to the 5 m
   lot width, and 2 story apartment units were stacked and accessed by
   interior ``streets{''}, thereby incorporating row house typology with
   increased density and inclusion of communal spaces. Given the density, a
   primary challenge was addressing human thermal comfort and providing
   public and semi-public social spaces.
   The project was presented to the heads of the Da Nang Urban Planning
   Institute, who noted the merits of the project and who encouraged future
   research to optimize cost, size, and fit to demographic, environmental,
   and other conditions. Overall, the prototype housing design appears as a
   promising first step to find more optimal solutions to the current and
   ongoing Vietnamese workforce housing problem.},

Abstract = {The mission of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is to
   prepare professionals and leaders in an ethnically diverse environment
   along with improving Science Technology Engineering Agriculture, and
   Mathematics (STEAM) instruction and research in the State of Maryland
   while serving a large population of underrepresented minority students.
   The Bioenergy and Bioproducts Educational Programs (a partnership
   between Cornell University and five other universities) at UMES are very
   well aligned with the University of Maryland System's, ``green{''}
   initiative. This program is geared towards helping reform educational
   infrastructure by promoting multidisciplinary activities and content in
   the areas of bioenergy and bioproducts. Such an interdisciplinary
   perspective enhances interactions of investigators, K-16 teachers and
   faculty, and pre-service teachers across disciplinary boundaries to
   provide insight to some of the intractable problems related to the
   environment. During the one-week institute on Bioenergy and Bioproducts
   for STEAM teachers and faculty held at UMES in the summer of 2012,
   various hands-on activities along with bioenergy and bioproducts-related
   curriculum development materials were presented to the ten educators.
   The educators represented middle and high school math, technology, and
   science teachers; and faculty and graduate teaching assistants involved
   with undergraduate science and math teaching at the university. The
   activities implemented at the institute followed Kolb's experiential
   learning cycle with some adaptations. The participants got the
   opportunity to acquire concrete experiences involving teamwork, time
   management, and project execution skills; reflected on their learning
   experiences through presentations at the end of the institute; developed
   concepts related to organic chemistry, engineering design,
   instrumentation, plant sciences, physics, mathematics, and environmental
   sciences; and actively experimented with virgin and used cooking oils to
   generate biodiesel, designed and set up a simple algae photobioreactor
   for culturing algae with the eventual objective of extraction of oil
   from the algal species and converting the oil into biodiesel, and made
   environmentally-friendly soaps from the glycerin produced from the
   biodiesel. Tools and kits were given to the participants to assist them
   in instruction in the classrooms and laboratories and for further
   advancing their STEAM curricula with a focus on bioenergy and
   bioproducts. The evaluation surveys conducted reveal that the educators
   gained substantial knowledge in the fields of bioenergy and bioproducts
   and expressed their interest in implementing the content as well as
   laboratories in their curricula.
   In the context of this project, discussions are already underway to
   promote such interdisciplinary efforts and synergize activities though
   the development of a core facility for bio-energy and sustainable
   bio-products. The project provides a model not just for other
   minority-serving institutions to accelerate reform efforts with
   interdisciplinary projects but also for other institutions that are
   examining best ways to position themselves for the future in order to
   maximize their key strengths. The key issues can also be captured in the
   multidisciplinary dimension of the terms ``biodiesel/renewable
   energy{''} and ``environmental stewardship{''} that have broad overlaps
   with the 21st Century's grand challenges espoused by the National

Title = {Use of a Common Garden Experiment in Selecting Adapted Beech Provenances

Abstract = {Increased frequency of extreme weather events has seriously affected
   forestry operations in south-eastern Europe. A precondition for
   effective artificial restoration of disturbed forest stands is
   site-adapted forest reproductive material (FRM). Common garden
   experiments (provenance trials) may assist in selecting such FRM. The
   main objective of this study was to establish among-provenance variation
   pattern using data from a beech provenance trial. Usefulness of the
   results in selecting seed sources for restoration of European beech
   stands is discussed. The trial was set up in 2007, at a slope of
   Medvednica mount facing north-west at 730-750 m above sea level. Plant
   heights were measured and survival scored in 2008 and 2015. Height
   increments were calculated and processed to determine variance
   components due to various effects. Highly significant
   provenance-by-block interaction was revealed, indicating strong
   microsite effects on provenance performances. Therefore, corrections
   were made and provenance mean height increments recalculated. Provenance
   mean height increment multiplied with survival was used as a measure of
   a provenance's adaptedness. Regression tree (RT) analysis was used to
   determine the pattern of among-provenance variations. A set of
   provenance dusters was grown using climatic variables related to the
   provenance stands of origin as criteria. All analyzed effects were
   significant (provenance: F=2.07, p<0.05; block: F=5.07, p<0.05;
   provenance by block interaction: F=7.32, p<0.001). Data corrections
   reduced the interaction effect, thereby increasing reliability of
   calculated provenance adaptedness indices (AI). Provenances were grouped
   into 4 clusters due to elevation, mean July temperature and summer
   heat-to-moisture index (SHM). Cluster 4, containing provenances from the
   highest altitudes (>750m), had the highest mean AI (143.9 +/- 8.4 cm).
   The lowest mean AI(106.7 +/- 14.8 cm) had cluster 1, containing
   provenances from lower altitudes with lower mean July temperatures (<=
   1.8.4 degrees C). Provenances originating from lower elevations with
   higher mean July temperatures (>18.4 degrees C) were further divided
   into two clusters due to the SHM variable. Cluster 2 had the second
   highest mean AI (141.2 +/- 1.5 cm) and contained provenances from
   relatively wetter habitats (SHM <= 48.2). Cluster 3, containing
   provenances from relatively arid habitats (SHM>48.2), had significantly
   lower mean AI (116.8 +/- 8.6 cm). Established among-provenance variation
   pattern might be used as a tool in selecting seed sources for artificial
   restoration of beech stands at mount Medvednica. It is advisable to use
   FRM from higher altitudes and/or from slightly lower altitudes (up to
   150 m lower than a restoring site) but featured with warmer and drier
   conditions compared to the trial. Generally, provenance trials should be
   utilized as a valuable decision tool in restoring disturbed forest
   stands but may also be misleading if not well designed and analyzed.},

Abstract = {Coastal hazards taken place all over the world have ended up with major
   devastations such as loss of life, property damage and environmental
   degradation more often. Sri Lanka, being an island in the Indian ocean
   is much vulnerable to coastal hazards; the unprecedented human disaster
   that caused by the Asian Tsunami was one of the worst examples. Present
   studies show that there are lot of programs carried out by the
   government and non-government organizations to drag down the adversity
   towards the coastal communities in the country who are much vulnerable
   to coastal disasters, focusing all the segments of basically social,
   economic and environmental aspects. Evacuation of coastal communities
   safely in disastrous situations is one of the main requirements within
   the disaster recovery framework. Having effective multi-hazard early
   warning (MHEW) systems and procedures in place in the coastal regions of
   the country helps to reduce the disaster risk. Although there are
   policies and practices for the evacuation of coastal communities
   including MHEW systems, the present study shows that the attention and
   preparedness towards the evacuation of people with special needs in the
   coastal communities is more or less omitted by the responsible parties.
   Moreover, when disasters strike, people with special needs meet various
   discriminations in terms of evacuation to a shelter or relief points and
   more often are overlooked from the emergency preparedness, response and
   recovery stages. Therefore, the present research focuses on determining
   the gaps in the evacuation of people with special needs in the context
   of MHEW systems during coastal hazards in Sri Lanka. Open interviews and
   telephone interviews were conducted in few major coastal cities and
   understood the likelihood of the obstacles, issues and the perception
   towards the evacuation of people with special needs. A questionnaire was
   developed according to the open interviews and fine-tuned in three
   sandpit events employing various local and foreign professionals in
   academics. The questionnaires were distributed online and the responses
   were analyzed. Eventually, a substantial number of gaps were identified
   in supporting the prevailing systems in Sri Lanka and was arrived at
   conclusions to impact the government through the findings in order to
   make the evacuation of people with special needs during coastal
   disasters more efficient.},

Title = {High diatom production and export in stratified waters - A potential
   negative feedback to global warming},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {119},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {4-23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is widely held that increased stratification and reduced vertical
   mixing in the ocean driven by global warming will promote the
   replacement of diatoms by smaller phytoplankton and lead to an overall
   decrease in productivity and carbon export. Here we present contrary
   evidence from a synergy of modern observations and palaeo-records that
   reveal high diatom production and export from stratified waters. Diatom
   adaptations to stratified waters include the ability to grow in low
   light conditions in deep chlorophyll maxima; vertical migrations between
   nutricline depths and the surface, and symbioses with N-2-fixing
   cyanobacteria in diatom-diazotroph associations (DDA). These strategies
   foster the maintenance of seed populations that may then exploit mixing
   events induced by storms or eddies, but may also inherently promote
   blooms. Recent oceanographic observations in the subtropical gyres, at
   increasingly high temporal and spatial resolutions, have monitored
   short-lived but often substantial blooms and export of
   stratified-adapted diatoms including rhizosolenids and the
   diazotroph-associated Hemiaulus hauckii. Aggregate formation by such
   diatoms is common and promotes rapid settling thereby minimizing water
   column remineralization and optimizing carbon flux. Convergence zones
   associated with oceanic fronts or mesoscale features may also generate
   substantial flux of stratified-adapted diatom species. Conventional
   oceanographic observing strategies and sampling techniques
   under-represent such activity due to the lack of adequate capability to
   sample the large sized diatoms and colonies involved, the subsurface
   location of many of these blooms, their common development in thin <3 m
   layers and their episodic nature. Superbly preserved ``palaeo-sediment
   trap{''} records in laminated sediments reveal enhanced production and
   export from stratified waters mediated by the same taxa. The organic
   carbon-rich Mediterranean sapropels were the result of production within
   deep chlorophyll maxima in highly stratified waters dominated by
   rhizosolenid diatoms but also including H. hauckii. In the Cretaceous
   when CO2 levels were higher than present, laminated sediments reveal
   dominant flux also including Hemiaulus and rhizosolenid species.
   Nitrogen isotope and biomarker studies suggest that, analogous to modern
   DDA blooms within the subtropical gyres, Hemiaulus blooms in the ancient
   Mediterranean and within the Cretaceous seas were aided by
   nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts. These lines of evidence
   suggest that diatom production and associated export of organic carbon,
   may not decrease, as is widely predicted, but may actually increase with
   greater ocean stratification, and potentially act as a negative feedback
   to global warming. However, the key genera involved in such potential
   feedbacks are underrepresented in both laboratory and field studies and
   are poorly represented in models. Our findings suggest that a
   reappraisal is necessary of the way diatoms are represented as plankton
   functional types (PFTs) in ocean biogeochemical models and that new
   observing and sampling strategies are also required to study these
   processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ecological characteristics of eucalanoid copepods of the eastern
   tropical North Pacific Ocean: Adaptations for life within a low oxygen
   system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {468},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The eastern tropical North Pacific Ocean (ETNP) is home to one of the
   largest and most severe mid-water oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Members
   of the copepod family Eucalanidae are abundant in this region and
   display varied vertical distributions throughout the OMZ. This research
   assessed the diversity of ecological strategies used by these copepods
   to cope with the presence of the OMZ based on their biochemical,
   physiological, and behavioral characteristics. Five species of copepods
   (Eucalanus inermis, Pareucalanus attenuatus, Rhincalanus nasutus,
   Rhincalanus rostrifrons, and Subeucalanus subtenuis) were collected at
   the Costa Rica Dome (9 degrees N, 90 degrees W) and Tehuantepec Bowl (13
   degrees N, 105 degrees W) during cruises in fall of 2007 and winter of
   2008-2009. Adult females of all species were collected and analyzed for
   water, ash, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, protein and lipid
   content, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and survivorship when
   exposed to prolonged low-oxygen conditions. Four distinct ecological
   strategies were observed for the five species based on genus. E inermis,
   found throughout the OMZ and surface waters, had very high water content
   (94\% of wet weight (WW)), leading to low organic content per unit WW.
   However, when corrected to ash-free dry weight (AFDW), Protein and
   storage lipid contents of this species had intermediate (46 and 8\% of
   AFDW, respectively) values compared to other species. E. inermis
   demonstrated high survivorship under low-oxygen conditions (>90\%), and
   had detectable levels of LDH, indicating an ability to rely on anaerobic
   pathways. Rhincalanus spp., found primarily in the lower-oxygen
   subsurface waters, also had detectable LDH activity and high
   survivorship under low-oxygen conditions (>85\%), but had much higher
   storage lipid levels (>37\% of AFDW), very low protein levels (28-33\%
   of AFDW), and low water content (87\% of WW). S. subtenuis and P.
   attenuatus are both distributed primarily in surface waters, but showed
   distinct ecological strategies. S. subtenuis protein levels were very
   high (67\% AFDW), storage lipid levels low (0\%), and water content low
   (87\% of WW). They also had very low survivorship under low-oxygen
   conditions (22\%) and no detectable LDH activity. P. attenuatus also did
   not have detectable LDH activity or large lipid stores. P. attenuatus,
   however, had much lower protein content (30\% AFDW) and higher water
   content (89\% of WW), indicating a distinct ecological strategy.
   Comparisons of ETNP individuals with conspecifics or congeners from
   higher-oxygen environments suggest that low protein levels (indicative
   of lower overall activity) seen in some groups may be an adaptation for
   survival in lower-oxygen regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Aquifer Management To Accelerate CO2 Dissolution and Trapping},
Journal = {SPE JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Bulk-phase CO2 injection into saline aquifers can provide substantive
   reduction in CO2 emissions if the risk arising from aquifer
   pressurization is addressed adequately through mechanisms such as brine
   production out of the system (Anchliya 2009). While this approach
   addresses the risks associated with aquifer pressurization it does not
   address the problem of ensuring CO2 trapping as an immobile phase and
   its accumulation at the top of the aquifer. The performance of
   bulk-CO2-injection schemes highly depends on the seal-integrity
   assessment and presence of thief zones. The accumulated pocket of free
   CO2 can readily leak through a breach in the aquifer seal. Ideally, the
   aquifer should be monitored as long as the free CO2 is present, but if
   the CO2 is not immobilized, it is expected to remain underneath the seal
   rock for more than 1,000 years. Therefore, long-term monitoring of the
   seal integrity and avoiding leakage will be very costly.
   To minimize the free CO2 below the caprock, we propose an engineered
   system to reduce aquifer pressurization and accelerate CO2 dissolution
   and trapping. We achieve these objectives through effective placement of
   brine injection and production wells to facilitate the lateral movement
   (hence, residual and solubility trapping) of CO2 in the aquifer and
   impede its upward movement. The simulation results for example
   engineered well configurations in this paper suggest that substantial
   improvements in immobilizing CO2 can be achieved through increasing
   enhanced solubility and residual trapping that result from better
   CO2-injection sweep efficiency. This approach has the potential to
   greatly reduce the risk of CO2 leakage both during and after injection.
   The controlled injection of CO2 with this technique reduces the
   uncertainty about the long-term fate of the injected CO2, prevents CO2
   from migrating toward potential outlets or sensitive areas, and
   increases the volume of CO2 that can be stored in a closed aquifer
   volume during the CO2-injection period. Field-scale compositional
   simulation cases are discussed, and sensitivity studies are used to
   provide guidelines for well spacing and flow rates depending on aquifer
   properties and the volume of CO2 to be stored. Although it requires
   additional drilled wells, the active engineered configuration proposed
   for CO2 injection significantly reduces the reservoir volume required to
   effectively sequester a given volume of CO2 and the increase in the cost
   caused by additional wells is recovered by dramatic reduction in
   monitoring cost.},

Title = {Managing input C/N ratio to reduce the risk of Acute Hepatopancreatic
   Necrosis Disease (AHPND) outbreaks in biofloc systems - A laboratory
   study},

Abstract = {Biofloc systems are microbial mature environments that are potentially
   less conducive disease outbreaks. We hypothesized that the way in which
   biofloc microbial communities are managed determines the level of
   disease protection. To investigate such hypothesis, Litopenaeus vannamei
   post-larvae were cultured for 21 days in biofloc environments created by
   different water management procedures. Five different types of bioflocs
   were created: autotrophic bioflocs without probiotics, autotrophic
   bioflocs with probiotics, heterotrophic bioflocs without probiotics,
   heterotrophic bioflocs with probiotics, and a flow-through system as a
   control. Heterotrophic bioflocs were obtained by daily addition of
   carbon (glucose) at an estimated C/N ratio of 18 throughout the
   experiment. For autotrophic bioflocs this input of carbon was applied
   only to start up the system and upon appearance of bioflocs (TSS > 100
   mg L-1) and a drop in total ammonium nitrogen concentration below 0.05
   mg L-1, carbon dosing was stopped. Bioflocs cultured with addition of
   probiotics received a 0.5 ppm dose every 48 hours. After 21-d culture
   period, a 96 h challenge test was performed with a Vibrio
   parahaemolyticus strain known to cause AHPND. For each biofloc type,
   this challenge was performed in three different approaches: 1- Shrimp
   were taken out of their biofloc tanks and challenged by applying new
   seawater; 2-Shrimp from biofloc tanks were challenged in their
   respective biofloc suspensions; and 3- Non-experimental shrimp, randomly
   selected from a recirculation (RAS) system were challenged in the types
   of biofloc suspensions. Mortality was high when shrimp were challenged
   in new seawater, independent of treatment. When challenged in their
   respective biofloc suspensions shrimp survival was the highest in
   heterotrophic bioflocs with and without probiotic supplementation and
   the autotrophic bioflocs with probiotics, whereas shrimp survival in
   autotrophic bioflocs without probiotics was 50\%. These results were
   similar when non-experimental shrimp originating from a RAS system were
   challenged in these biofloc suspensions. Taken together, results suggest
   that bioflocs as such can decrease the impact of a Vibrio
   parahaemolyticus challenge and that this protection depends on the
   operational parameters of the biofloc system. Moreover, probiotics can
   be used to complement the protective effect of bioflocs. This
   information reinforces the importance of microbial community management
   as a tool to reduce the risk of disease and establish highly biosecure
   systems.},

Abstract = {Factors contributing to population growth through strong year-class
   formation have driven a century of directed research in fisheries
   science. A central discovery of Hjort's paradigm was that multiple
   generations overlap and longevity is matched with frequency of strong
   recruitments. Here, I elaborate on this tenet by examining how
   intra-population modalities in spawning and early habitat use favour
   population resiliency. A modem theory that has application is the
   storage effect {[}Warner, R.R., Chesson, P.L., 1985. Coexistence
   mediated by recruitment fluctuations - a field guide to the storage
   effect. Am. Nat. 125, 769-787], whereby spawning stock biomass
   accumulates each year so that when early survival conditions are
   favourable, stored egg production can result in explosive population
   growth. I review two early life history behaviours that contribute to
   the storage effect: split cohorts (i.e., seasonal pulses of eggs and
   larvae) and contingent behaviour (i.e., dispersive and retentive
   patterns in early dispersal). Episodic and pulsed production of larvae
   is a common feature for marine fishes, well documented through otolith
   microstructure and hatch-date analyses. In temperate and boreal fishes,
   early and late spawned cohorts of larvae and juveniles may have
   differing fates dependent upon seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in
   weather and climate. Often, a coastal fish may spawn for a protracted
   period, yet only a few days' egg production will result in successful
   recruitment. In these and other instances, it is clear that diversity in
   spawning behaviour can confer resilience against temporal variations in
   early survival conditions. Although many factors contribute to
   intra-population spawning modalities, size and age structure of adults
   play an important role. Contingent structure, an idea dating to Hjort
   (herring contingents) and Gilbert (salmon contingents), has been
   resurrected to describe the diversity of intra-population modalities
   observed through otolith microchemical and electronic tagging
   approaches. Retentive and dispersive behaviours confer resiliency
   against early survival conditions that vary spatially. Examples of
   contingent structure are increasingly numerous for diadromous fishes.
   Here, a nursery habitat associated with a contingent behaviour may make
   a small contribution in a given year, but over a decade contribute
   significantly to spawning stock biomass. For flatfish and other marine
   fishes, contingent structure is probable but not well documented.
   Proximate factors leading to contingent structure are poorly known, but
   for diadromous fishes, time of spawning and early life history energetic
   thresholds is hypothesized to lead to alternative life cycles. Here
   again time of spawning may lead to the storage effect by hedging against
   spatial variance in early vital rates. Managing for the storage effect
   will be promoted by conservation of adult age structure and early
   habitats upon which both strong and weak year-classes rely. (c) 2006

Abstract = {The United States is finally recoiling from the mass incarceration
   crisis that has plagued it for half a century. The world's largest
   incarcerator has seen a small drop in prison numbers since 2008.
   However, the rate of decline is so slow that it would take half a
   century for incarceration numbers to reduce to historical levels.
   Further, the drop in prison numbers has occurred against the backdrop of
   piecemeal reforms, and there is no meaningful, systematic mechanism to
   reduce incarceration levels. Despite this, there is now, for the first
   time, a growing public acceptance that prison is a problematic, possibly
   flawed, sanction. Prison is expensive, inflicts serious unintended
   suffering on incarcerated people, and profoundly damages families.
   Alternatives to prison are finally being canvassed. In one respect this
   is not surprising. The way that we deal with serious offenders has not
   meaningfully changed for more than 500 years-during all this time, we
   have simply locked offenders behind high walls. The way we deal with
   people who have caused serious harm has been more resistant to
   scientific and technological advances than any other aspect of society.
   The most radical suggestion regarding prison reform is to abolish
   prisons. Prison abolition has been a theme in some limited academic
   quarters for many decades. It had never received anything approaching
   mainstream credibility as a reform option, but this is now changing.
   Prominent politicians, social groups, university organizations, and
   mainstream media commentaries have recently advocated prison abolition.
   This proposal is no longer a fringe idea. It has gained considerable
   currency, particularly in light of the dual societychanging phenomena of
   the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement. Yet, the
   persuasiveness of the proposal to abolish prison evaporates when any
   degree of intellectual rigor is cast over it. It is likely to go down as
   naive idealism due to the absence of any practical alternatives to
   prison. This Article shores up the notion of prison abolition to the
   maximum degree that is pragmatically feasible by carefully outlining an
   alternative to prison and hence addresses what is thought to be an
   insurmountable flaw in the abolitionist proposal. We advance a viable
   alternative to prison that involves the use and adaption of existing
   monitoring and censoring technology, which will enable us to monitor and
   observe the actions of offenders in real-time and, when necessary, to
   halt offenders' potentially harmful acts before they occur. In proposing
   this new sanction, we provide lawmakers and the community a pathway to
   abolishing most prisons. The reforms suggested in this Article can
   result in the reduction of prison numbers by more than 90\%, without any
   diminution in public safety.},

Title = {Influence of Chemical, Mechanical, and Transport Processes on Wellbore
   Leakage from Geologic CO2 Storage Reservoirs},
Journal = {ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {50},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1829-1837},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wells are considered to be high-risk pathways for fluid leakage from
   geologic CO2 storage reservoirs, because breaches in this engineered
   system have the potential to connect the reservoir to groundwater
   resources and the atmosphere. Given these concerns, a few studies have
   assessed leakage risk by evaluating regulatory records, often
   self-reported, documenting leakage in gas fields. Leakage is thought to
   be governed largely by initial well-construction quality and the method
   of well abandonment. The geologic carbon storage community has raised
   further concerns because acidic fluids in the CO2 storage reservoir,
   alkaline cement meant to isolate the reservoir fluids from the overlying
   strata, and steel casings in wells are inherently reactive systems. This
   is of particular concern for storage of CO2 in depleted oil and gas
   reservoirs with numerous legacy wells engineered to variable standards.
   Research suggests that leakage risks are not as great as initially
   perceived because chemical and mechanical alteration of cement has the
   capacity to seal damaged zones. Our work centers on defining the coupled
   chemical and mechanical processes governing flow in damaged zones in
   wells. We have developed process-based models, constrained by
   experiments, to better understand and forecast leakage risk. Leakage
   pathways can be sealed by precipitation of carbonate minerals in the
   fractures and deformation of the reacted cement. High reactivity of
   cement hydroxides releases excess calcium that can precipitate as
   carbonate solids in the fracture network under low brine flow rates. If
   the flow is fast, then the brine remains undersaturated with respect to
   the solubility of calcium carbonate minerals, and zones depleted in
   calcium hydroxides, enriched in calcium carbonate precipitates, and made
   of amorphous silicates leached of original cement minerals are formed.
   Under confining pressure, the reacted cement is compressed, which
   reduces permeability and lowers leakage risks. The broader context of
   this paper is to use our experimentally calibrated chemical, mechanical,
   and transport model to illustrate when, where, and in what conditions
   fracture pathways seal in CO2 storage wells, to reduce their risk to
   groundwater resources. We do this by defining the amount of cement and
   the time required to effectively seal the leakage pathways associated
   with peak and postinjection overpressures, within the context of oil and
   gas industry standards for leak detection, mitigation, and repairs. Our
   simulations suggest that for many damage scenarios chemical and
   mechanical processes lower leakage risk by reducing or sealing fracture
   pathways. Leakage risk would remain high in wells with a large amount of
   damage, modeled here as wide fracture apertures, where fast flowing
   fluids are too dilute for carbonate precipitation and subsurface stress
   does not compress the altered cement. Fracture sealing is more likely as
   reservoir pressures decrease during the postinjection phase where lower
   fluxes aid chemical alteration and mechanical deformation of cement. Our
   results hold promise for the development of mitigation framework to
   avoid impacting groundwater resources above any geologic CO2 storage
   reservoir by correlating operational pressures and barrier lengths.},

Title = {Harnessing Synergistic Biostimulatory Processes: A Plausible Approach
   for Enhanced Crop Growth and Resilience in Organic Farming},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Demand for organically grown crops has risen globally due
   to its healthier and safer food products. From a sustainability
   perspective, organic farming offers an eco-friendly cultivation system
   that minimizes agrochemicals and producing food with little or no
   environmental footprint. However, organic agriculture's biggest drawback
   is the generally lower and variable yield in contrast to conventional
   farming. Compatible with organic farming, the selective use of
   biostimulants can close the apparent yield gap between organic and
   conventional cultivation systems. A biostimulant is defined as natural
   microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) or biologically active substances that
   are able to improve plant growth and yield through several processes.
   Biostimulants are derived from a range of natural resources including
   organic materials (composts, seaweeds), manures (earthworms, fish,
   insects) and extracts derived from microbes, plant, insect or animal
   origin. The current trend is indicative that a mixture of biostimulants
   is generally delivering better growth, yield and quality rather than
   applying biostimulant individually. When used correctly, biostimulants
   are known to help plants cope with stressful situations like drought,
   salinity, extreme temperatures and even certain diseases. More research
   is needed to understand the different biostimulants, key components, and
   also to adjust the formulations to improve their reliability in the
   field. Demand for organically grown food crops is rising substantially
   annually owing to their contributions to human health. However, organic
   farm production is still generally lower compared to conventional
   farming. Nutrient availability, content consistency, uptake,
   assimilation, and crop responses to various stresses were reported as
   critical yield-limiting factors in many organic farming systems. In
   recent years, plant biostimulants (BSs) have gained much interest from
   researchers and growers, and with the objective of integrating these
   products to enhance nutrient use efficiency (NUE), crop performance, and
   delivering better stress resilience in organic-related farming. This
   review gave an overview of direct and indirect mechanisms of microbial
   and non-microbial BSs in enhancing plant nutrient uptake, physiological
   status, productivity, resilience to various stressors, and
   soil-microbe-plant interactions. BSs offer a promising, innovative and
   sustainable strategy to supplement and replace agrochemicals in the near
   future. With greater mechanistic clarity, designing purposeful
   combinations of microbial and non-microbial BSs that would interact
   synergistically and deliver desired outcomes in terms of acceptable
   yield and high-quality products sustainably will be pivotal.
   Understanding these mechanisms will improve the next generation of novel
   and well-characterized BSs, combining microbial and non-microbial BSs
   strategically with specific desired synergistic bio-stimulatory action,
   to deliver enhanced plant growth, yield, quality, and resilience
   consistently in organic-related cultivation.},

   (24-33 degrees C). Changes in larval weights, respiration, excretion,
   net growth efficiencies (K-2) and O:N ratios were modeled by polynomial
   regression and examination of the unfolding of the phases in the
   resulting nonlinear three dimensional response surfaces along the fourth
   or time/larval stage dimension. Larval growth rate was sigmoid and
   divided into three phases each comprising several instars: a post
   embryonic low or no-growth phase, an exponential-growth phase and a
   pre-metamorphosis slow growth phase. Low K-2 and O:N values during the
   low or no-growth phase indicate that growth is not the priority and
   available energy from stored Lipoprotein may be channeled into
   programmed tissue reorganization. Histology suggests that the focus is
   dedifferentiation and reconstruction of the hepatopancreas. A sharp
   discontinuity, followed by a rotation and translation of the oxygen
   consumption response surface at this point suggests a physiological
   shift to a new domain of attraction. This was related to the
   commissioning of the hepatopancreas and the changeover to reliance on an
   exogenous food supply. In the exponential growth phase increasing net
   growth efficiency and low O:N values show that anabolic processes
   predominate. During the final pre-metamorphosis phase, net growth
   efficiency decreases-but energy utilization remains high. The weight
   specific ammonia-nitrogen excretion response surface shows a tendency
   towards increasing excretion as salinity decreases. This suggests that
   the new physiological attractor is the development of an osmoregulatory
   mechanism based on counter-ion exchange. This may be a driving force for
   postlarval migration back to freshwater. This study suggests that the
   integral mobility of response surfaces during larval development can
   identify homeostatic adjustments associated with crossing the apparent
   boundary between one physiological domain of attraction and another. (C)

Abstract = {Manoeuvring and docking ships in confined waterways is difficult, time
   consuming and potentially dangerous. Disturbances caused by changing
   water currents, wind and waves, the rapidly changing effects of the sea
   bed, and by the approach of other ships add to manoeuvring difficulty. A
   ship's master or pilot can do little to counter these factors until
   their effect on the course or speed of the ship can be determined.
   Controlling a ship's movement is, at best, a reaction to the
   disturbance's effect on the ship, rather than the disturbance itself and
   at times this reaction occurs too late. This is thought to be the
   primary reason why accidents involving strikings and groundings
   outnumber all other types of ship accidents in Canada.
   Realizing the marine industry's need for a fast, reliable system to
   predict the future motion of a ship, the Canadian Centre for Marine
   Communications (CCMC), in collaboration with the Transportation
   Development Centre (TDC), initiated the SPS project. To meet the
   requirements and challenge of the project, under the Scientific
   Authority of TDC and CCMC, CORETEC Incorporated was selected to develop
   the system. The SPS will contribute significantly to shipping safety and
   higher operating efficiency providing real-time information on the
   predicted trajectory of the vessel, information the captain could use to
   consider the consequences of a certain action before performing it. This
   information would help the captain manoeuvre in difficult situations,
   particularly in restricted waters, and avoid collisions with other ships
   or structures. Advanced versions of SPS may even provide automatic
   control of the ship.
   The predictive component of the SPS is an innovative adaptive model that
   combines artificial intelligence technology (Neural Networks) with
   state-of-the-art mathematical modelling techniques. The SPS utilizes
   various sensors to provide real-time, high-precision prediction of a
   vessel's motion. The trajectory predictor automatically adjusts its
   parameters to optimize its prediction. The package will run on
   IBM-compatible computers, and can be integrated with Electronic Chart
   Systems (ECS) or Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems
   (ECDIS) currently used on many ships. It generates a high-precision
   prediction of the vessels trajectory and superimposes this trajectory on
   an ECDIS or ECS unit's display. The SPS will provide ship's officers
   with the expected future behaviour of the ship by generating the
   vessel's predicted path up to twenty minutes ahead of its present
   position. The SPS has a high degree of accuracy, within approximately
   one metre, depending on the accuracy of the positioning system.
   A fully operational SPS prototype has been developed and will be
   commencing field trials that are tentively scheduled for the early
   Spring of 1997 with a second set of prototype finalization trials to
   occur in late spring of 1997. With the successful conclusion of its SPS
   field trials, CORETEC will have a powerful commercial usage endorsement
   of the SPS. CORETEC is confident that there is a strong market demand
   for the SPS.

Title = {Active CO2 reservoir management for carbon storage: Analysis of
   operational strategies to relieve pressure buildup and improve
   injectivity},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {For industrial-scale CO2 injection in saline formations, pressure
   buildup can limit storage capacity and security. Active CO2 Reservoir
   Management (ACRM) combines brine production with CO2 injection to
   relieve pressure buildup, increase injectivity, manipulate CO2
   migration, and constrain brine leakage. By limiting pressure buildup, in
   magnitude, spatial extent, and duration. ACRM can reduce CO2 and brine
   leakage, minimize interactions with neighboring subsurface activities,
   allowing independent assessment and permitting, reduce the Area of
   Review and required duration of post-injection monitoring, and reduce
   cost and risk. ACRM provides benefits to reservoir management at the
   cost of extracting brine. The added cost must be offset by the added
   benefits to the storage operation and/or by creating new, valuable uses
   that can reduce the total added cost. Actual net cost is expected to be
   site specific, requiring detailed analysis that is beyond the scope of
   this paper, which focuses on the benefits to reservoir management. We
   investigate operational strategies for achieving an effective tradeoff
   between pressure relief/improved-injectivity and delayed CO2
   breakthrough at brine producers. For vertical wells, an injection-only
   strategy is compared to a pressure-management strategy with brine
   production from a double-ring 9-spot pattern. Brine production allows
   injection to be steadily ramped up while staying within the
   pressure-buildup target, while injection-only requires a gradual
   ramp-down. Injector/producer horizontal-well pairs were analyzed for a
   range of well spacings, storage-formation thickness and area, level and
   dipping formations, and for homogeneous and heterogeneous permeability.
   When the producer is downdip of the injector, the combined influence of
   buoyancy and heterogeneity can delay CO2 breakthrough. Both vertical and
   horizontal wells can achieve pressure relief and improved CO2
   injectivity, while delaying CO2 breakthrough. Pressure buildup and CO2
   breakthrough are sensitive to storage-formation permeability and
   insensitive to all other hydrologic parameters except caprock-seal
   permeability, which only affects pressure buildup for injection-only
   cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effectiveness of fuel treatments for mitigating wildfire risk and

Abstract = {Fuel-reduction treatments are used extensively to reduce wildfire risk
   and restore forest diversity and function. In the near future,
   increasing regulation of carbon (C) emissions may force forest managers
   to balance the use of fuel treatments for reducing wildfire risk against
   an alternative goal of C sequestration. The objective of this study was
   to evaluate how long-term fuel treatments mitigate wildfires and affect
   forest C. For the Lake Tahoe Basin in the central Sierra Nevada, USA,
   fuel treatment efficiency was explored with a landscape-scale simulation
   model, LANDIS-II, using five fuel treatment scenarios and two
   (contemporary and potential future) fire regimes. Treatment scenarios
   included applying a combination of light (hand) and moderate
   (mechanical) forest thinning continuously through time and transitioning
   from these prescriptions to a more mid-seral thinning prescription, both
   on a 15 and 30 year rotation interval. In the last scenario, fuel
   treatments were isolated to around the lake shore (nearby urban
   settlement) to simulate a low investment alternative were future
   resources may be limited. Results indicated that the forest will remain
   a C sink regardless of treatment or fire regime simulated, due to the
   landscape legacy of historic logging. Achievement of a net C gain
   required decades with intensive treatment and depended on wildfire
   activity: Fuel treatments were more effective in a more active fire
   environment, where the interface between wildfires and treatment areas
   increased and caused net C gain earlier than as compared to our
   scenarios with less wildfire activity. Fuel treatments were most
   effective when continuously applied and strategically placed in high
   ignition areas. Treatment type and re-application interval were less
   influential at the landscape scale, but had notable effects on species
   dynamics within management units. Treatments created more diverse forest
   conditions by shifting dominance patterns to a more mixed conifer
   system, with a higher proportion of fire-tolerant species. We
   demonstrated that a small amount of wildfire on the landscape resulted
   in significant changes in the C pool, and that strategically placed fuel
   treatments substantially reduced wildfire risk, increased fire
   resiliency of the forest, and is beneficial for long-term C management.
   Implications for landscape management included consideration for
   prioritization of treatment areas and creating ideal re-entry schedules
   that meet logistic, safety, and conservation goals. In forests with a
   concentrated wildland urban interface, fuel treatments may be vital for
   ensuring human welfare and enhancing forest integrity in a fire-prone
   future. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {THE SUSTAINABLE MICRO-SCALE MOVEMENT OF COMMUNITIES: CASE STUDIES OF
   SUBDIVIDED DEVELOPMENT AND ADAPTIVE REUSE OF SHARED SPACE IN NEW YORK
   CITY},

Abstract = {In New York City a decline in manufacturing has propelled social and
   economic changes that have transformed certain districts {[}1,2]. Unused
   building stock there has been the basis for adaptive reuse yielding new
   housing for families of varying compositions. The constant pressure of
   the need for affordable housing has resulted in the conversion of
   existing abandoned industrial structures, providing a green,
   environmentally friendly alternative to new construction {[}3,4,5].
   Adaptive reuse provides an opportunity to bring a building up to current
   codes, to make the layout and building systems more appropriate and
   efficient, and to help revitalize neighborhoods.
   The nineteenth through the middle of the twentieth centuries were
   characterized by urban environments which provided manufacturing jobs
   and the municipal services and education that supported them {[}6].
   American cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh became
   boom-towns as people followed employment opportunities and moved to
   these locations throughout this period {[}7,8,9]. In the decades after
   World War II, the creation of highways and freeways-including the
   interstate highway system that stretched east to west and north to
   south-led to suburbanization, exemplified by Long Island's mushrooming
   Levit-town and many more like it {[}5,10]. These were the Baby Boom
   years. The suburban sprawl ultimately resulted in the creation of mega
   cities like New York City. Families typically consisted of a father,
   mother, and at least two children {[}16]. This trend was supported by
   strong manufacturing industries and plentiful space that allowed much of
   the population to fulfill the American dream of home ownership {[}2,11].
   As labor cost increased due to stricter labor laws, unions, increasing
   land cost, and higher taxes, many manufacturers began a search for less
   costly environments, moving first to locations in the less expensive
   suburbs and then to the South {[}4,8]. Eventually, American factories
   moved overseas to places such as China, other Asian countries, and South
   America. This became known as out sourcing manufacturing {[}6,7,12].
   With the subsequent boom town collapse that began in the 1980s and
   continued through the new millennium, old U. S. industrial cities faced
   declining populations, and Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and their
   like were soon deserted by those who could no longer find employment
   there {[}14,40]. City populations decreased by as much as 50\% and in
   some places even more steeply {[}13]. According to the U. S. Census (
   figure 1) {[}13,14], among American cities only New York City's and Los
   Angeles's populations have grown since the 1980s. Migration for
   employment opportunities became common and members per household, and
   households of one or two became not uncommon {[}15,16]. Typical housing
   no longer required a big space for shelter and a lawn or garden, and
   many people looked for smaller units {[}11,16]. Smaller working spaces
   made micro-scale businesses possible. New York City is an example of
   this change. Left with abandoned super block manufacturing buildings
   such as the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Brooklyn Army Terminal and retired
   infrastructure, New York City has looked for ways to repurpose these
   structures {[}10,17]. Super block, old manufacturing buildings and
   factories still stand, but in New York and elsewhere some have become
   mixed-use spaces.
   The goal of this paper is to examine how New York City served the public
   by providing working and living space through the conversion of existing
   super block buildings and creating new public spaces out of under-used
   or abandoned infrastructure. Comparative case studies are conducted
   focusing on the microscale movement and renewed use of old
   infrastructure. It considers a future model for sub-divided building
   spaces and repurposed structures providing shared, public venues as it
   analyzes this movement structurally and the changes it has wrought on
   local communities.},

Abstract = {The Pampanga River basin, which is the second largest drainage basin on
   Luzon Island (Republic of the Philippines), frequently suffers from
   severe flood events, caused by monsoon rainfall and typhoon strikes.
   Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine local flood
   characteristics and potential flood vulnerability, based on the basin's
   geography (e.g., distribution of topography, land use and past flood
   records). Our land classification shows that the basin consists of three
   major topographic regions: mountain and hill, volcano, and alluvial
   plain. The mountain and hill region is further divided into topographic
   units of mountain and hill, and volcano region is subdivided into
   volcanic slope, volcanic piedmont gentle slope, and volcanic fan. On the
   other hand, the alluvial plain is divided into fan, terrace, back marsh,
   swamp, delta, valley plain, natural levee, meander scroll, and former
   channel. In the upper alluvial plain, the supply of sediments, triggered
   by the Philippine Fault activities, contributes to a southwestern fan I,
   fan II and terrace II development on the western side of the Pampanga
   River. Terrace I and terrace II on the other hand, develop in western
   direction on the eastern side of the Pampanga River. Owing to the
   mountains, hills, and volcanoes that surround the alluvial plain, its
   width is reduced to 20 km at Arayat. As a consequence, floodwaters
   easily concentrate and stagnate here, creating the two swamps of San
   Antonio and Candaba. In the lower portion of the alluvial plain, low
   gradient bed slopes, land subsidence, and tidal intrusion of sea water
   enhance poor drainage situations. As a result, floodwaters from Candaba
   Swamp cannot drain efficiently, causing severe floods. The alluvial
   plain was divided into four zones (I-IV), based on the flood patterns
   that were identified by the geographical conditions of the basin. Floods
   in zone I and zone II located on the western and eastern side of the
   Pampanga River are smoothly drained. On the other hand, people in the
   most downstream flood-prone area (zone III and zone IV) receive much
   benefit from the cyclic floods by stimulating the agricultural and
   fishery production, but the deep inundation also damages their houses.
   Nonetheless, some coexist with the floods seemingly without fear, and
   did not even evacuate during the largest recent flood event of 2011. The
   population of the basin is still increasing, and flood risks should be
   reduced through government-initiated actions. Furthermore, in order for
   the region's inhabitants to take effective measures to fight flooding
   and sustain flood-adaptive lifestyles, they should be required to
   understand the local geographical characteristics and regional flood
   vulnerability.},

Title = {Development of genetic programming-based model for predicting oyster
   norovirus outbreak risks},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {20-37},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Oyster norovirus outbreaks pose increasing risks to human health and
   seafood industry worldwide but exact causes of the outbreaks are rarely
   identified, making it highly unlikely to reduce the risks. This paper
   presents a genetic programming (GP) based approach to identifying the
   primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks and predicting oyster
   norovirus outbreaks in order to reduce the risks. In terms of the
   primary cause, it was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks were
   controlled by cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions
   characterized by low solar radiation, low water temperature, low gage
   height (the height of water above a gage datum), low salinity, heavy
   rainfall, and strong offshore wind. The six environmental variables were
   determined by using Random Forest (RF) and Binary Logistic Regression
   (BLR) methods within the framework of the GP approach. In terms of
   predicting norovirus outbreaks, a risk-based GP model was developed
   using the six environmental variables and various combinations of the
   variables with different time lags. The results of local and global
   sensitivity analyses showed that gage height, temperature, and solar
   radiation were by far the three most important environmental predictors
   for oyster norovirus outbreaks, though other variables were also
   important. Specifically, very low temperature and gage height
   significantly increased the risk of norovirus outbreaks while high solar
   radiation markedly reduced the risk, suggesting that low temperature and
   gage height were associated with the norovirus source while solar
   radiation was the primary sink of norovirus. The GP model was utilized
   to hindcast daily risks of oyster norovirus outbreaks along the Northern
   Gulf of Mexico coast. The daily hindcasting results indicated that the
   GP model was capable of hindcasting all historical oyster norovirus
   outbreaks from January 2002 to June 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico with only
   two false positive outbreaks for the 12.5-year period. The performance
   of the GP model was characterized with the area under the Receiver
   Operating Characteristic curve of 0.86, the true positive rate
   (sensitivity) of 78.53\% and the true negative rate (specificity) of
   88.82\%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the GP model. The
   findings and results offered new insights into the oyster norovirus
   outbreaks in terms of source, sink, cause, and predictors. The GP model
   provided an efficient and effective tool for predicting potential oyster
   norovirus outbreaks and implementing management interventions to prevent
   or at least reduce norovirus risks to both the human health and the
   seafood industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Using noble gas fingerprints at the Kerr Farm to assess CO2 leakage
   allegations linked to the Weyburn-Midale CO2 monitoring and storage
   project},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {215-225},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For carbon capture and storage technology to successfully contribute to
   climate mitigation efforts, the stored CO2 must be securely isolated
   from the atmosphere and oceans. Hence, there is a need to establish and
   verify monitoring techniques that can detect unplanned migration of
   injected CO2 from a storage site to the near surface. Noble gases are
   sensitive tracers of crustal fluid input in the subsurface due to their
   low concentrations and unreactive nature. Several studies have
   identified their potential to act as tracers of deep fluid migration to
   the shallow subsurface, but they have yet to be used in a contested
   situation. In January 2011 it was reported extensively in global media
   that high CO2 concentrations in soils and related groundwater pollution
   had been identified on a farm property belonging to the Kerr family,
   located near to the town of Weyburn in Saskatchewan, Canada. The origin
   of this CO2 pollution was cited to be the nearby Weyburn-Midale CO2
   Monitoring and Storage Project. Here, as part of an investigation funded
   independently of the Weyburn-Midale field operators, we present delta
   C-13(DIC), He-3/He-4, He-4/Ne-20, Ne-20, Ar-36, Ar-40 and Kr measured in
   waters obtained from four groundwater wells located on and surrounding
   the Kerr property. We aim to establish if stable carbon and noble gas
   natural tracers are effective at determining if migration of CO2 from
   the storage project was responsible for the alleged high CO2
   concentrations and water pollution measured on the Kerr farm. We compare
   the stable carbon isotope and noble gas `fingerprints' of the Kerr
   groundwaters to those expected in a water equilibrated with the
   atmosphere under local recharge conditions, the produced CO2 obtained
   from production wells, and the CO2 injected into the Weyburn and Midale
   oil fields. We find that the stable carbon isotope data do not constrain
   the origin of the dissolved CO2 in the Kerr groundwaters. Due to low
   noble gas concentrations in the captured CO2 we are unable to completely
   rule out the presence of 20-34\% contribution from injected CO2 to the
   groundwaters surrounding the Kerr property. However, we find that all of
   the Kerr groundwater samples exhibit noble gas fingerprints that would
   be expected in a shallow groundwater in contact with the atmosphere and
   hence there is no evidence for the addition of a deep radiogenic
   component or dilution from the addition of a gas phase low in
   atmospheric derived noble gases. Our findings corroborate previous
   studies that indicate that elevated CO2 concentrations found on the Kerr
   property are almost certainly of biological origin, and not migrated
   from the deep subsurface. The comprehensive follow up to these CO2
   leakage allegations outlined in this study provides a robust framework
   for responses to any future leakage allegations at CO2 storage sites and
   further highlights that no single technique can categorically identify
   the origin of CO2 in the shallow subsurface. Hence, it is essential that
   the full range of geochemical tracers (stable carbon and C-14 isotopes,
   noble gases, water chemistry, process based gas ratios) are integrated
   with a good understanding of geological and engineering data in response
   to CO2 leakage allegations in the future.},

Title = {Effects of Cisatracurium in Sevoflurane and Propofol Requirements in
   Dog-Undergoing-Mastectomy Surgery},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Gas anesthesia is widely used in clinical practice; it
   results in better management of the surgical patient by reducing the
   risks attached to anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockers, such as
   cisatracurium besylate, result in muscle relaxation of varying
   dose-dependent duration; however, they do not have analgesic and
   hypnotic efficacy, which is the reason of the combination with analgesic
   and anesthetic substances. The present study aimed to evaluate the
   possible reduction of anesthetic drugs used in bitches undergoing
   mastectomy surgery. The results obtained showed that the cisatracurium
   resulted in a good degree of myorelaxation without the manifestation of
   side effects and, more importantly, allowed the reduction of anesthetics
   used for induction (propofol) and maintenance (sevoflurane) of
   anesthesia. The possibility of reducing the doses of the drugs used
   maintaining also a good anesthesia enriches the scenario of different
   protocols that can be used in the canine patient. The purpose of the
   present study was to test whether the addition of cisatracurium in
   combination with propofol and sevoflurane would result in a change in
   doses of used anesthetic drugs. Ten dogs (Group A) undergoing elective
   unilateral mastectomy surgery were included in the study. To induce and
   maintain anesthesia, subjects received propofol and sevoflurane at
   varying doses; analgesia was performed with remifentanil. After three
   months, the same subjects (Group B) underwent contralateral mastectomy
   and received the same anesthetic protocol with the addition of
   cisatracurium at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg(-1). The following parameters
   were monitored during anesthesia: heart rate, systolic blood pressure,
   end-tidal CO2, oxygen saturation, halogenate requirement, and rectal
   temperature at baseline (T-0), induction (T-1), 5 (T-5), 10 (T-10), 15
   (T-15), 20 (T-20), 25 (T-25), 30 (T-30), and 35 (T-35) time points. In
   Group A, halogenate requirement was reduced at all the time points other
   than T1 (p < 0.001); in Group B, the percentage of halogenate
   requirement was already reduced at T-1 and remained constant during the
   experimental period, showing no significant intragroup differences. The
   dose requirements of sevoflurane and propofol varied significantly
   between the two groups, with significantly lower dosages in the Group B
   (the cisatracurium-treated group). Moreover, patients treated with
   cisatracurium showed a stable anesthetic plan. The
   nondepolarizing-muscle-relaxant cisatracurium besylate could be
   considered a useful adjunct to anesthetic protocols.},

Abstract = {In recent years there has been a strong emphasis on kinetic (vibration)
   energy harvesting using smart structure technology. This emphasis has
   been driven in large part by industry demand for powering sensors and
   wireless telemetry of sensor data in places into which running power and
   data cables is difficult or impossible. Common examples are helicopter
   drive shafts and other rotating equipment. In many instances, available
   space in these locations is highly limited, resulting in a trend for
   miniaturization of kinetic energy harvesters. While in some cases size
   limitations are dominant, in other cases large and even very large
   harvesters are possible and even desirable since they may produce
   significantly more power. Examples of large-scale energy harvesting
   include geomatics, which is the discipline of gathering, storing,
   processing, and delivering spatially referenced information on vast
   scales. Geomatics relies on suites of various sensors and imaging
   devices such as meteorological sensors, seismographs, high-resolution
   cameras, and LiDAR's. These devices may be stationed for prolonged
   periods of time in remote and poorly accessible areas and are required
   to operate continuously over prolonged periods of time. In other cases,
   sensing and imaging equipment may be mounted on land, sea, or airborne
   platforms and expected to operate for many hours on its own power.
   Providing power to this equipment constitutes a technological challenge.
   Other cases may include commercial buildings, unmanned powered gliders
   and more. Large scale kinetic energy harvesting thus constitutes a
   paradigm shift in the approach to kinetic energy harvesting as a whole
   and as often happens it poses its own unique technological challenges.
   Primarily these challenges fall into two categories: the cost-effective
   manufacturing of large and very large scale transducing elements based
   on smart structure technology and the continuous optimization ( tuning)
   of these transducers for various operating conditions. Current research
   proposes the simultaneous solution of both of the aforementioned
   challenges via the use of specialized technology for the incorporation
   of large numbers of piezoelectric transducers into standard printed
   circuit boards and the continuous control of structural resonance via
   the application of adaptive compressive stress. Used together, these
   technologies allow for fully scalable and tunable kinetic energy
   harvesting. Since the design is modular in nature and a typical size of
   a single module can easily reach dimensions of 60 by 40 centimeters,
   there is virtually no upper limit on the size of the harvester other
   than the limits that derive from its specific applications and
   placement. The use of compressive forces rather than the commonly used
   non-structural mass for the tuning of the harvester frequency to the
   disturbing frequency allows for continuous adaptive tuning while at the
   same time avoiding the undesirable vibration damping effects of
   non-structural mass. A proof of concept large-scale harvester capable of
   manual compressive force tuning was built as part of the current study
   and preliminary tests were conducted. The tests validate the proposed
   approach showing power generation on the order of 10 mW at disturbing
   frequencies between 10 and 100 Hz, with RMS voltages reaching over 20
   volts and RMS currents over 2 mA, with proven potential for 50 mW with
   over 100 VAC and 10 mA for a transducing panel 20 by 10 cm.
   The results also validate the tuning via compressive force approach,
   showing strong dependence of energy harvesting efficiency on the
   compressive force applied to the transducing panel.},

Abstract = {Background In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose
   crisis in the United States (US), new strategies are needed to address
   the epidemic and to efficiently engage and retain individuals in care
   for opioid use disorder (OUD). Moreover, there is an increasing need for
   novel approaches to using health data to identify gaps in the cascade of
   care for persons with OUD. Methods and findings Between June 2018 and
   May 2019, we engaged a diverse stakeholder group (including directors of
   statewide health and social service agencies) to develop a statewide,
   patient-centered cascade of care for OUD for Rhode Island, a small state
   in New England, a region highly impacted by the opioid crisis. Through
   an iterative process, we modified the cascade of care defined by
   Williams et al. for use in Rhode Island using key national survey data
   and statewide health claims datasets to create a cross-sectional summary
   of 5 stages in the cascade. Approximately 47,000 Rhode Islanders (5.2\%)
   were estimated to be at risk for OUD (stage 0) in 2016. At the same
   time, 26,000 Rhode Islanders had a medical claim related to an OUD
   diagnosis, accounting for 55\% of the population at risk (stage 1); 27\%
   of the stage 0 population, 12,700 people, showed evidence of initiation
   of medication for OUD (MOUD, stage 2), and 18\%, or 8,300 people, had
   evidence of retention on MOUD (stage 3). Imputation from a national
   survey estimated that 4,200 Rhode Islanders were in recovery from OUD as
   of 2016, representing 9\% of the total population at risk. Limitations
   included use of self-report data to arrive at estimates of the number of
   individuals at risk for OUD and using a national estimate to identify
   the number of individuals in recovery due to a lack of available state
   data sources. Conclusions Our findings indicate that cross-sectional
   summaries of the cascade of care for OUD can be used as a health policy
   tool to identify gaps in care, inform data-driven policy decisions, set
   benchmarks for quality, and improve health outcomes for persons with
   OUD. There exists a significant opportunity to increase engagement prior
   to the initiation of OUD treatment (i.e., identification of OUD symptoms
   via routine screening or acute presentation) and improve retention and
   remission from OUD symptoms through improved community-supported
   processes of recovery. To do this more precisely, states should work to
   systematically collect data to populate their own cascade of care as a
   health policy tool to enhance system-level interventions and maximize
   engagement in care.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? In the US, drug overdose
   represents a leading cause of accidental death. In light of this growing
   epidemic, frameworks are needed to understand how to improve health
   systems to identify and engage individuals with substance use disorders
   in evidence-based treatment modalities. Cascades of care have been used
   to track and improve population health outcomes for multiple complex
   health conditions by encouraging data-driven policy decisions to adapt
   and strengthen systems of care for how these conditions are managed, but
   few cascades of care are available for use for local jurisdictions
   addressing opioid use disorder (OUD). What did the researchers do and
   find? We engaged a group of stakeholders-local experts on opioid use and
   its consequences, leaders from state agencies governing health and
   social services, directors of nongovernmental organizations providing
   health and social services to people living with OUD, and community
   advocates with lived experiences of OUD and recovery-to adapt and define
   a cascade of care for OUD for use in Rhode Island. The stakeholder
   engagement process resulted in a cascade of care with 5 stages,
   beginning with individuals at risk for OUD (stage 0), continuing to
   individuals who are diagnosed with OUD (stage 1) and establish
   engagement with a medication-based treatment plan (stage 2), and ending
   with continuous engagement with this treatment plan (stage 3) and
   recovery (stage 4). Using national survey estimates and statewide
   administrative claims databases, we found that 26,000 Rhode Islanders
   were diagnosed with OUD (stage 1) in 2016, 12,700 people showed evidence
   of treatment initiation (stage 2), and 8,300 had evidence of continuous
   engagement with treatment for at least 6 months (stage 3). Based on a
   national survey estimate, about 4,200 individuals are estimated to have
   achieved recovery from OUD using medications (stage 4). What do these
   findings mean? Engagement with a diverse group of stakeholders can
   result in the development of a cascade of care to assess and measure the
   success of statewide health systems in delivering interventions to
   address opioid-related harms. The cascade of care can be used as a
   framework to strengthen health systems that may result in reductions in
   the number of individuals at risk for OUD and increases in the number of
   individuals with OUD who are able to achieve long-term recovery. The
   estimates of the numbers of individuals in each stage represent a static
   ``snapshot{''} and are considered preliminary; further efforts are
   needed to fine-tune these proportions. For example, limitations included
   having to use the definition of recovery and estimates used in the
   National Recovery Survey, as there are currently no statewide data
   sources for measuring recovery. Further research is needed to understand
   how to best define and operationalize this stage at a statewide level.},

Abstract = {About 40\% of all fish species occur in freshwater, although only 1\% of
   the globe is occupied by freshwaters. The tropics harbour a high
   percentage of these fishes. Freshwater zooplankton on the other hand is
   far less diverse than its marine counterpart and the tropics do not
   harbour a markedly high percentage of freshwater species either. The
   antecedents of freshwater zooplankton appear to have come from riverine
   and terrestrial habitats via temporary habitats (ponds, floodplains).
   The present zooplankton composition has also been shaped by, among other
   factors, the highly efficient zooplanktivorous modern teleosts which
   have restricted the formerly widespread Branchiopoda mainly to fishless
   freshwaters. Those Branchiopoda frequently co-existing with fishes
   (Cladocera) have their size composition strongly influenced by fish
   predation. Circumstantial evidence indicates that pelagic zooplankton
   (Cladocera, Copepoda, Rotifera) appear to provide a relatively scarce
   food supply relative to the littoral region for the early stages of
   fishes. Also, unpredictability of zooplankton may be involved here.
   These factors have led to the loss of planktonic eggs and the siting of
   fish breeding in shallow littoral situations, where other animal foods
   besides zooplankton are also available, especially for later stages of
   juvenile fish. The Ostariophysi breed in the shallow expanses of flood
   waters while the Cichlidae, some of which breed like Ostariophysi, also
   breed in standing waters in the littoral of lakes or floodplains. In all
   these locations zooplankton and benthic organisms, especially insects,
   are available. The cichlids are, in addition, provided with parental
   care. Predation on young fishes is also reduced by these strategies.
   Young fishes may also be adapted to feed on patches of zooplankton and
   other food in their breeding grounds. Tropical pelagic clupeids and
   cyprinids may breed continuously. Some of these clupeids in rivers breed
   at low water.
   Zooplankton, supplemented by other animal food is more critical to
   achieving the potential fish yields in the tropics than in temperate
   freshwaters because fish yields in the tropics can be very high indeed.
   The high metabolic rate of young fishes in the tropics adds to the
   demand for food. Tropical freshwaters have a relatively high primary
   production but a low zooplankton/phytoplankton ratio. Zooplankton is
   kept small in size and biomass by continuous predation. Herbivorous
   fishes can sustain very high fish yields in the tropics but they must
   have a high fecundity and high survival of young produced seasonally,
   mainly in rivers or even continuously as in lakes and reservoirs to
   weather predation. Rich littoral zooplankton and benthos combined with
   omnivory and a higher efficiency in the use of the available animal food
   by newly hatched fishes may be critical factors linking fish yields to
   zooplankton in tropical freshwaters. The ability of herbivorous tilapias
   to give very high fish yields in shallow tropical lakes may also be due
   to their efficient use of animal food, algae and microphagy in young
   stages besides other favourable adaptations like opportunistic feeding
   on detrities and the ability to feed on and digest cyanobacteria,
   abundant in the tropics.
   The high percentage of the global fish species found in freshwaters and
   the ability of some species to produce very high fish yields is proof
   that biological strategies used by freshwater fishes are highly
   successful. Recently, it has been shown that an ancient marine food
   chain duplicated in the ancient tropical lake, Tanganyika, is far more
   efficient than more recently evolved food chains in lakes and
   reservoirs. Understanding these strategies will assist both in fish
   culture and management of freshwater fisheries.},

Title = {Youth risk behavior surveillance - National Alternative High School
   Youth Risk Behavior Survey, United States, 1998},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Alternative high schools serve approximately 280,000 students nationwide
   who are at high risk for failing or dropping out of regular high school
   or who have been expelled from regular high school because of illegal
   activity or behavioral problems. Such settings provide important
   opportunities for delivering health promotion education and services to
   these youth and young adults. However; before this survey, the
   prevalence of health-risk behaviors among students attending alternative
   high schools nationwide was unknown.
   The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors the
   following six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth
   and young adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and
   intentional injuries; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use: sexual
   behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and
   sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) (including human immunodeficiency
   virus {[}HIV] infection); unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical
   inactivity. The national Alternative High School Youth Risk Behavior,
   Survey (ALT-YRBS) is one component of the YRBSS; it was conducted in
   1998 to measure priority health-risk behaviors among students at
   alternative high schools. The 1998 ALT-YRBS used a three-stage cluster
   sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of students
   in grades 9-12 in the United States who attend alternative high schools.
   The school response rate Ir as 81.0\%, and the student response rate was
   81.9\%, resulting in an overall response rate of 66.3\%. Tills report
   summarizes results from the 1998 ALT-YRBS. The reporting period is
   February - May 1998.
   In the United States, 73.6\% of all deaths among youth and young adults
   aged 10-24 years results from only four causes - motor vehicle crashes,
   other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the
   1998 ALT-YRBS demonstrates that many students at alternative high
   schools engage in behaviors that increase their likelihood of death from
   these four causes. During the 30 days preceding the survey 51.9\% had
   ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, 25.1\% had driven a
   vehicle after drinking alcohol. 32.9\% had carried a weapon, 64.5\% had
   drunk alcohol, and 53.0\% had used marijuana. During the 12 months
   preceding the survey, 15.7\% had attempted suicide, and 29.0\% had
   rarely or never worn a seat belt. Substantial morbidity among
   school-aged youth and young adults also results from unintended
   pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. ALT-YRBS results indicate
   that in 1998, a total of 87.8\% of students students at alternative high
   schools had had sexual intercourse, 54.1\% of sexually active students
   had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 5.7\% had ever
   injected an illegal drug. Among adults aged greater than or equal to 25
   years, 66.5\% of all deaths result from two causes - cardiovascular
   disease and cancer Most risk behaviors associated with these causes of
   death are initiated during adolescence. In 1998, a total of 64.1\% of
   students at alternative high schools had smoked cigarettes during the 30
   days preceding the survey, 38.3\% had smoked a cigar during the 30 days
   preceding the survey, 71.2\% had not eaten greater than or equal to 5
   servings of fruits and vegetables during the day preceding the survey,
   and 81.0\% had nor attended physical education (PE) class daily.
   Comparing ALT-YRBS, results with 1997 national YRBS results demonstrates
   that the prevalence of most most, risk behaviors is higher among
   students attending alternative high schools compared with students at
   regular high schools. Some risk behaviors are more common among certain
   sex and racial/ethnic subgroups of students.
   ALT-YRBS data can be used nationwide by health and education officials
   to improve policies and programs designed to reduce risk behaviors
   associated with the leading causes of,morbidity and mortality among
   students attending alternative high schools.},

Title = {Forgoing the fallow in Bangladesh's stress-prone coastal deltaic
   environments: Effect of sowing date, nitrogen, and genotype on wheat
   yield in farmers' fields},
Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {7-20},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rising wheat demand in South Asia necessitates crop intensification to
   meet food security needs. Increased grain output can be achieved by
   bridging yield gaps on currently farmed land or by expanding cultivation
   to new land, though the latter entails environmental trade-offs and
   offers limited potential as most of South Asia's arable land is already
   cropped. Alternatively, opportunities for boosting production may exist
   where farmers can transition from single to double cropping and forgo
   dry season fallows - which are estimated at between 240,000 and 800,000
   ha in southern Bangladesh - and establish a crop such as wheat following
   monsoon season rice. Southern Bangladesh's fallows result from prolonged
   post-monsoon soil saturation, soil salinity, and farmers' low
   risk-bearing and investment capacity. In response, we assessed the
   potential to sow wheat on land that is seasonally fallow with approaches
   that optimize yields while reducing risk and rationalizing costs.
   Working with 64 farmers in eight production environments, we examined
   yield response to three genotypes, BG25 and BG27 (with salinity- and
   heat-tolerant traits) and BG21 (local check), across a gradient of
   sowing dates, grouped as `early' (sown before 15 December) and `late'
   (after 15 December), under 0, 100 and 133 and 0, 67 and 100 kg N ha(-1)
   for early- and late-sowing groups, respectively. Across environments and
   genotypes, yield ranged from 2.11 to 4.77 t ha(-1) (mean: 3.9 t ha(-1))
   under early-sowing, and from 0.83 to 4.27 t ha(-1) (mean: 2.74 t ha(-1))
   under late-sowing. Wheat performance varied with environment (1.68-4.77
   t ha(-1) at 100 kg N ha(-1) across sowing groups); the lowest yields
   found where early sowing was delayed and soil salinity levels were
   elevated. Small but significant (P<0.001) yield differences (0.22 t
   ha(-1)) were found between 100 and 133 kg N ha(-1) for the early-sowing
   group, though no difference was found between 67 and 100 kg N ha(-1) for
   late-sowing. Combining early- and late-sowing groups, significant
   environment x N rate and sowing-group x N rate interactions (both
   P<0.001) for 100 kg N ha(-1) indicated the importance of site-and
   time-specific N management in these stress-prone environments.
   Considering all cultivars and environments, ECa at sowing, flowering and
   grain filling negatively correlated with yield (r=0.50, 0.59 and 0.54,
   all P<0.001). Correlations with ground water depth at flowering and
   grain filling were negative and significant, but less pronounced in the
   context of farmer-managed irrigation scheduling. Despite putative
   stress-tolerance traits in two of the three entries, no genotypic yield
   differences were found under early-sowing, though small differences
   (<0.19 t ha(-1)) were observed with late sowing. Agronomic fertilizer-N
   efficiency (AE-N) was consistently higher for 100 than 133 and 67 than
   100 kg N ha(-1) for early- and late-sowing. The marginal economic value
   of N application followed similar trends, indicating that rates of at
   most 100 and 67 kgN ha(-1) are favorable for sowing before or after
   December 15th. Wheat can replace dry season fallows in Bangladesh's
   coastal delta, though site-specific management practices are needed to
   optimize yields while rationalizing investment costs to avoid the
   poverty traps that may ensue from poor management. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {PHOTOSYNTHETIC CARBON ASSIMILATION IN AQUATIC MACROPHYTES},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {5-40},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In submerged aquatic macrophytes the relationship between net
   photosynthesis and carbon concentration in the water often follows a
   less gradual pattern than anticipated assuming simple Michaelis-Menten
   kinetics.  This indicates that other factors than the activity of the
   carboxylation enzymes are important in the regulation of photosynthesis
   in these plants.  At low external concentrations of inorganic carbon,
   photosynthesis is restricted by the slow rate of diffusion from the bulk
   medium to the site of carboxylation, whereas the maximum photosynthetic
   capacity appears to be set by the enzyme activity or the turnover of
   intermediates in the carbon reduction cycle, including adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) and reducing agents.  The potential for active
   transport of inorganic carbon across the plasmalemma may also be of
   importance in some instances.
   Different strategies, which could be seen as adaptations to ameliorate
   the carbon constraints, have evolved in submerged macrophytes.  These
   could be separated into physiological and exploitation strategies. 
   Among the former, the most widespread is use of HCO3- in photosynthesis.
   The rationale for this strategy is the rather high concentration of
   HCO3- in most freshwaters and in seawater.  Bicarbonate use has been
   found in approximately 50\% of the species tested.  Other physiological
   adaptations involve use of C4 acids in photosynthesis based on some kind
   of C4 or crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).  These strategies, however,
   appear to be of only minor importance, C4-like photosynthesis is found
   in a few freshwater and marine species and CAM is found mainly among the
   isoetids and in a few other species.  The exploitation strategies all
   involve morphological features which allow the plants to avoid or reduce
   carbon limitation by exploiting alternative carbon sources in addition
   to those in the water.  The most widespread is the development of
   floating or aerial leaves, which allow access to the atmospheric CO2
   pool, where CO2 is more readily available owing to the higher diffusion
   rate and current velocity in air relative to water.  Use of
   sediment-CO2, another exploitation strategy, has been recognized in
   several species, especially from the isoetid group.  These species all
   have an extensive lacunal system with longitudinal channels from the
   roots to the leaves, providing an efficient transport route for
   sediment-CO2.  In these species, sediment-derived CO2 can be responsible
   for more than 90\% of the total carbon uptake.  Sediment-CO2
   concentrations are nearly always higher than the concentration in the
   water column; nevertheless, significant use of sediment-CO2 is not found
   in elodeid species.  It has been suggested that this is due to the long
   diffusion path, low shoot/root ratio and a high, inherent rate of
   photosynthesis in these species.
   The carbon extraction capacity, which reflects the extent to which the
   plants use HCO3- or C4 acids in photosynthesis, is not a constant
   attribute among submerged macrophytes.  However, some general trends are
   present.  The extraction capacity is high in most macroalgae,
   intermediate in elodeid freshwater species and low in isoetids and in
   elodeid species with the potential of exploiting CO2 sources other than
   those in water.  Accordingly, light-saturated photosynthesis in marine
   macroalgae is often carbon saturated at natural inorganic carbon
   concentrations, but rarely so among freshwater macrophytes.  In addition
   to these apparently genetic differences in carbon extraction capacity
   among the plant groups, environmental conditions also influence the
   carbon uptake characteristics.  When carbon is not limiting, i.e. at
   high CO2 and low light, high extraction capacity and carbon affinity are
   suppressed.  This response seems appropriate as the plants thereby
   reduce investment in carbon acquisition systems when not needed and
   instead allocate energy to increase assimilation of more limiting
   resources.  Thus, it is apparent that submerged macrophytes possess a
   homeostatic capacity that reduces the effects of imbalance among
   resources needed.  However, it is evident that aquatic macrophytes, in
   particular freshwater species, often have an excess capacity for carbon
   assimilation not realized at ambient conditions of inorganic carbon. 
   The significance of this overcapacity is unclear, but it stresses the
   importance of inorganic carbon as a potential limiting factor for
   photosynthesis and possibly growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes.},

Abstract = {The Czech Republic (CR) lies on the watershed divide of three seas-The
   North, Baltic and Black Seas. The watershed of these seas divides the
   territory of the CR into three international catchment areas (Labe, Odra
   and Danube). In conjunction with the fulfilment of obligations arising
   from the Convention of the European Economic Commission of the United
   Nations Organisation on the protection and use of transboundary
   watercourses and international lakes, an ``International Commission{''}
   was founded in 1990-1998 for each international catchment area. The CR
   is a member of the International Commissions for the protection of these
   catchment areas. The purpose of the activity of these institutions is to
   support cooperation in water management at the level of international
   catchment areas. It is obvious that practically all significant
   watercourses in the CR drain water beyond its boundary on the
   territories of the neighbouring states, resulting in the fact that water
   sources in the CR are practically dependent on the amount and
   distribution of atmospheric precipitation. In the context of discussing
   changing climatic conditions, atmospheric precipitation of very
   different intensities increases the likelihood of the occurrence of
   extreme floods and dry episodes. The theme of protection from the
   consequences of floods and drought is part of joint debates of all three
   international commissions. The approach to the solution of the issues
   above, however, can be different because it is based on the current
   conditions of the given international catchment area. Many fields and
   areas give attention to the theme of threats posed by natural disasters
   created by flood situations and drought not only from the view of
   science. It is not possible to prevent floods or drought by the present
   scientific knowledge and technical options. In case of floods, it is
   possible to reduce their impact on the lives and property of inhabitants
   by constructing efficient flood control works. However, it is necessary
   to have in mind that even the best flood control measure will only be as
   reliable, efficient and safe as its weakest element will be reliable,
   efficient and safe. In many cases, this element is earth-fill dams.
   Therefore, it is necessary to have continuous and long-term information
   on their condition. When addressing the issue of drought in the CR, it
   is necessary to realise that the absolute majority of water sources
   depends on the retention and accumulation of water in the territory of
   the CR. At present, the impacts of drought and lack of water in the
   conditions of the CR are significantly mitigated by the existing water
   management infrastructure. However, it can be expected for the future
   that the existing water sources will not be sufficient. Not only the
   aspect of the potentially diminishing available amount of surface water
   and subsurface water in the CR will be problematic, but also the aspect
   of the unsuitable quality of water. Also from this aspect, it is
   possible to see the earth-fill dam as an element that helps retain and
   accumulate water in the landscape. The reality is that every inhabitant
   of the CR is a significant user of its water sources, and it is
   necessary to bear the responsibility for them. Unfortunately, people
   usually realise neither the significance nor the value of the discussed
   irreplaceable nature wealth for everyday life, nor the scope of
   activities and financial costs that are associated with this ``matter of
   course{''}.
   In this chapter, the team of the authors provides a view of
   international cooperation and its achievements when dealing with a
   project of applied research in the EUREKA programme, which was focused
   on the development and construction of monitoring technology enabling
   changes in water content to be monitored in a porous medium. The
   selected results are documented in a link to remedial measures applied
   to earth-fill dams of water reservoirs in the conditions of the CR,
   emphasising the use of the method of electrical impedance spectrometry.
   The authors are aware of the fact that it is only a fragment of the
   solution of the complex of the outlined issue. However, it is obvious
   that without the safe operation of water management works, the
   irreplaceable part of which is their monitoring, it is impossible
   neither to ensure water sources nor to manage them.},

Abstract = {Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states
   are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To
   assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group
   improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample
   of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized
   clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64
   years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations.
   Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support
   scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized
   Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group
   participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that
   consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150
   minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant.
   Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean
   age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6\% were women. No significant
   differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two
   groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the
   intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and
   social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both
   groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in
   the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with
   initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the
   control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those
   who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5
   points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the
   control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study
   indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving
   the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45\% gross domestic product in Balearic
   Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with
   important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a
   significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication,
   poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research
   question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and
   health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the
   exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and
   health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed
   methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10
   semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study
   (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion
   criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season
   in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content
   analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified
   positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with
   co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working
   conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently
   rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping
   strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS:
   1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7
   years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7).
   HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2\% (IC 95\%
   65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9\% (IC 95\% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands;
   55.3\% (IC 95\% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6\% and 35.1\% self-reported
   regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived
   hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of
   rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related
   to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer
   season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker
   than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human
   rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51\%), repetitive and having a
   severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost.
   Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low
   detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to
   recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection.
   Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can
   a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health
   care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge,
   improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical
   trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least
   20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a
   validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months.
   In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults:
   Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There
   was a 63.5\% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant
   difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average
   of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make
   appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not
   they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There
   was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize
   gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant
   differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion:
   Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude
   sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The
   results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV
   in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest
   in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to
   guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care
   workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare
   research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the
   knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available
   information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to
   collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to
   improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to
   inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care
   and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data
   flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented.
   Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted
   third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data
   protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established
   concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A
   steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results:
   First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000
   unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice
   cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population.
   Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This
   portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics,
   drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data
   from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and
   link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a
   research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds
   in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of
   morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and
   interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are
   attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the
   short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop
   and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or
   death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of
   decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in
   primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study
   including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in
   primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation
   cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort
   included 561 patients, women were 56\%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03)
   years and 31.5\% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first
   month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were
   54\%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9\% of patients were
   hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate
   models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous
   year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea,
   paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV,
   saturation of oxygen lower than 90\% or an increase in the dyspnoea at
   the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the
   HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed
   a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81,
   95\% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an
   adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow
   p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95\% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The
   HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily
   measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term
   hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart
   failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
   (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
   care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that
   explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational
   and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to
   reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial:
   qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health
   districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district
   (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty
   stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected
   based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three
   groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low
   efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
   (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data.
   Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by
   the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31
   CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished
   between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention
   (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders
   engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished
   (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate,
   compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed
   internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and
   11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We
   identified the constructs that explain the variation in the
   effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to
   redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these
   constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
   (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
   care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care
   educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners
   (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel
   cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres
   from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut),
   Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and
   Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova
   lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts
   included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted
   to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours
   workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and
   deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly
   feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with
   information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control
   group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes:
   Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed
   by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in
   patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized
   mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level
   of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to
   treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5\%) were lost
   to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was
   -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of
   long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients
   older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An
   educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to
   reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP)
   frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased
   efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both
   government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the
   proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after
   triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP,
   proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of
   the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures.
   Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident
   analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled
   trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED
   during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained
   nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During
   control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected
   using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of
   2733 (11\%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these
   patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7\% for 14
   intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED.
   Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93\%, in 6\% of the
   cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC
   instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more
   discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an
   automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we
   will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first
   results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention.
   More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost
   efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be
   drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual
   and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll.
   Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical,
   psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search
   improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the
   evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the
   effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention
   (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy)
   through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working
   population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical
   care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial,
   conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona.
   Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188,
   PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received
   usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual
   care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10
   hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs
   questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity.
   Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to
   treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369
   enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0\%) provided data at the three
   months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2\%) at 12 months. Mean age of study
   subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2\% were
   women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a
   decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve
   months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical
   performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time
   and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups.
   Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a
   positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at
   work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in
   international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since
   then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept
   comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the
   participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion
   is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping
   these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need.
   This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care
   Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice.
   The stability of policies for community participation in primary
   healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional
   ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the
   coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all
   community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of
   exclusion whereby so-called `hard to reach' groups are not adequately
   involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for
   refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host
   countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee
   and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern
   of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on
   the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way
   forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for
   research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This
   presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family
   practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together
   refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to
   work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice.
   This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community
   participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective
   implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but
   also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of
   subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and
   evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete
   collaboration and communication between communities and other parties
   involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and
   stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European
   research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a
   consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing
   stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods:
   Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and
   VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included
   Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five
   Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder
   Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers,
   collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers,
   champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were
   implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members,
   patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and
   policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual
   interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and
   analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and
   other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting
   cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own
   needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and
   healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by
   identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing
   project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting
   dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary
   stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition
   statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion:
   Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are
   currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal,
   synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community
   participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating
   findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial,
   implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared
   decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are
   evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource
   countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality
   decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones.
   Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English
   language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so
   that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre
   for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based
   approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of
   materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation
   and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive
   semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were
   conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local
   community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content
   analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main
   themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension,
   socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and
   personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each
   theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are
   presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to
   be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population,
   albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data
   collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify
   concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of
   the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our
   ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate
   and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael
   Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care,
   Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School
   Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and
   nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and
   very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the
   health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the
   business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of
   products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision
   of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should
   seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for
   every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the
   patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms,
   the value is the perception that people have about clinical
   effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical
   effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a
   hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is
   reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do
   patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to
   enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response,
   we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based
   healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a
   healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and
   physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under
   value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients
   improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic
   disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to
   achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the
   key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model:
   1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care
   delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical
   overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5.
   Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6.
   Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community
   Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are
   mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality
   of community life, political systems require economic, housing,
   education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health.
   2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how
   to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each
   community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of
   all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an
   intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined
   community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their
   actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly
   populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland
   (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had
   difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high
   elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model
   of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of
   Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model
   of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was
   limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be
   booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily
   anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results:
   Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old
   increased by 70\% vs. a 2\% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region.
   Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19\% in
   Borgholm vs. 9\% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital
   care episodes decreased 7\% in Borgholm vs. 13\% increase for the rest
   of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8\% in Borgholm
   vs. 21\% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75
   years old decreased 4\% in Borgholm vs. a 10\% increase for the rest of
   Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a
   comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and
   community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a
   reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural
   Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a
   critical role for early identification and care of patients with
   dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and
   improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To
   estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North
   Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from
   20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age
   over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP
   electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450
   (3.5\%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over
   65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3\%)
   followed by vascular dementia 27.11\%. The average age of respondents in
   the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50\% patients under the age of 79
   years, 65.6\% were female and 68.4\% were with elementary school. In the
   entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3\%)
   said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor
   was hypertension (85.1\%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic
   attacks (29.3\%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4\% of patients had high
   levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8\%) acetylcholinesterase
   inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77
   (17.1\%) memantine, while 247 (54.9\%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4\%)
   reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of
   the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of
   patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the
   majority of these patients (more than 50\%) the reason for not receiving
   therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6\%). Conclusion:
   This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence
   in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare
   needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical
   internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills
   is certain. Research question: `What is the emotional experience of
   second and third-year medical students during their first clinical
   internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by
   their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12
   students in their second or third year of medical training at the
   University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were
   carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a
   grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were
   sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience
   during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often
   ignored and was not taken into account in the development of
   professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal
   training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher.
   Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense
   emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering
   environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the
   experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional
   experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion:
   Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened
   to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection
   of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing
   experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as
   cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as
   exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive
   internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and
   death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
   (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among
   patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of
   different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a
   population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All
   patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and
   were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at
   least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years
   2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the
   medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered
   purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as `good
   medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine
   patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten
   thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5\%) were treated with
   apixaban, 6321 (24.3\%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1\%) were
   treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0\%) were treated with dabigatran.
   Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9\% for rivaroxaban, 84.9\%
   for apixaban, 83.6\% for dabigatran and 55.8\% for warfarin (p<.0001).
   Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and
   glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates
   (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion:
   Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher
   than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into
   consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be
   conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of
   cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance
   appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is
   lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are
   overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim
   databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was
   to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases.
   The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients
   not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an
   organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female
   patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge
   trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no
   cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted
   from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected
   the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to
   the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in
   the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history
   of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening
   irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of
   `unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both
   lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95
   had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were
   pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166
   patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health
   insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by
   7.6\%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of
   their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18\%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by
   humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The
   field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use
   of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in
   PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research
   question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC
   research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the
   literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A
   search equation using the following MeSH terms `big data, data mining,
   Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning,
   Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice,
   electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the
   PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries
   according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible
   articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources
   articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the
   articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles
   were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were
   finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly
   described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation
   about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description
   of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the
   codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the
   algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic
   diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily
   described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a
   consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more
   information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give
   their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression
   and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network,
   the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as
   valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has
   been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian.
   Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research
   question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of
   HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods:
   HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians
   in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to
   promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients
   complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R
   package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with
   missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions
   of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and
   dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried
   out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and
   sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to
   all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling
   effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most
   consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive
   discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA
   indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension
   and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global
   Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and
   0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent
   psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has
   two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are
   not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French
   version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause
   worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages
   of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and
   Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary
   prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to
   prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people
   were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners
   (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers
   and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention
   implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived
   rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until
   theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients,
   patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview
   guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health
   promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD
   prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations,
   barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible
   solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded
   thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group.
   Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12
   patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals
   highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention
   programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention.
   Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk
   balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures.
   GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their
   recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared.
   Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change.
   Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another.
   Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these
   community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in
   contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These
   plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and
   knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.},

Abstract = {In November, 2001, the R/V ``Point Sur{''} departed from the Moss
   Landing Marine Laboratories pier with the first prototype of a high-Q,
   tunable organ pipe projector. The first test of the tunable Teledyne
   Webb Research (TWR) organ-pipe was successfully conducted on 11.09.2001.
   The TWR sound source demonstrated exceptional performance. It was
   coherent, efficient, powerful, and had unlimited operational depth, as
   well as a minimum level of high frequency harmonic content. The
   projector uses a narrow-band, highly efficient sound resonator, which is
   tuned to match the frequency and phase of a reference
   frequency-modulated signal. A finite element simulation shows the
   structural acoustics of the tunable resonator. The results of such
   simulation for the organ pipe with the octave frequency band are
   presented and discussed. This sound source was built for the Naval
   Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA) for studying temperature variability
   in the California Current. Since 2001, many deep-water ocean acoustic
   experiments have used this type of TWR sound source. The operating
   history of the sound sources is reviewed here. The first variant of the
   TWR sound source tuned the frequency of the resonator tube over the
   bandwidth 200-300 Hz. Modifications with 140-205 Hz, 500-1000 Hz and
   800-1200 Hz frequency sweeps have been built. The transmission duration
   can vary from one second to a few minutes. In October 2002 a TWR sound
   source was deployed on the top of Hoke Seamount. It transmitted 135-s
   linear frequency sweeps for ocean acoustic tomography and RAFOS 80-s
   narrow-band chirps for two years until October 2004. The signal was
   received with a good signal-to-noise ratio at 700 km range. During 2004
   and 2005 the TWR sound source system was used as a part of the
   instrumentation for the Meridional Overturning Variability Experiment (
   MOVE) of the International program CLIVAR. The sound source was deployed
   near the French island of Guadeloupe and transmitted tomographic signals
   to measure the temperature of the North Atlantic cold deep waters during
   2004-2005. After solving the engineering problems found in the first sea
   trials, a modified deep-water version of the sound source was built for
   long-term deployment.
   In 2004 the TWR source system was integrated with a 4-channel STAR
   (Simple Tomographic Acoustic Receiver) system developed at SCRIPPS. The
   STAR controller combines a low-power crystal oscillator and a much
   higher power rubidium oscillator that is turned on once per day to
   provide a precision time base. It also includes a long-baseline
   underwater acoustic navigation system to measure mooring motion. Two TWR
   sources (225-325 Hz) with STAR controllers were moored at depths of
   about 3000 m in the 2004-2005 North Pacific Acoustic Laboratory (NPAL04)
   experiment. The sources were approximately 500 and 1000 km distant from
   two closely spaced vertical receiving arrays. One of these sources was
   subsequently deployed in a short-term Pilot Study/Engineering Test
   conducted in the Philippine Sea during April-May 2009. The experiment
   had a single 185-km acoustic path between the swept-frequency TWR source
   and a prototype of the SCRIPPS Distributed Vertical Line Array (DVLA)
   receiver. An array of six TWR sound sources with a radius of 330 km was
   used for a year-long ocean acoustic tomography experiment in the
   Philippine Sea during 2010-2011. One of these sources was a
   low-frequency variant that transmitted 140-205 Hz signals.
   In August 2008 the Fram Strait Acoustic Tomography Experiment DAMOCLES
   started. The experiment included the development and implementation of
   an ocean acoustic tomography network to monitor the average heat content
   across the Fram Strait. The system included the TWR source on the east
   of the strait and the SCRIPPS vertical receiving array in the middle of
   the strait. The signal was received at a 686m-long aperture vertical
   array. After one year of operation the instruments were successfully
   recovered. During 2010-2012 the Fram Strait system consisted of a STAR
   receiver array and three TWR systems integrated with STAR receiver
   systems to provide travel time measurements for Thermometry along 6
   paths. Besides transmitting broadband tomographic signals, the sound
   sources also transmitted RAFOS signals for navigation of Seagliders and
   deep water floats. The acoustic monitoring of Fram Strait is continuing
   now as part of the UNDER-ICE project. The UNDER-ICE system will be
   recovered in June 2016.
   In 2013 the TWR specially designed a sound source for a sea floor
   deployment. The bottom-deployed swept frequency array can be used for
   high-resolution seismic imaging of deep geological formations. Acoustic
   Zoom Inc., Paradise, Newfoundland, Canada, is pioneering such innovative
   technology. The novel seismic exploration technique adapted from sonar
   applications enables high-resolution imaging of geological structures
   using beam-formed and beam-steered seismic signals. The method employs a
   purpose-designed, steerable phased arrays, analogous to the arrays used
   in radio astronomy, for both the source and receiver. The higher
   resolution attainable in the method is derived from its use and reliance
   on having a densely clustered high-frequency seismic capture of
   high-fidelity marine swept frequency TWR sources. Teledyne Marine
   Systems continue innovating promising solutions for seismo-acoustic
   applications.},

Title = {Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Compressible and Incompressible Flows
   on Space-Time Adaptive Meshes: Toward a Novel Family of Efficient
   Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics},

Abstract = {In this work the numerical discretization of the partial differential
   governing equations for compressible and incompressible flows is dealt
   within the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework along space-time
   adaptive meshes. Two main numerical frameworks can be distinguished: (1)
   fully explicit ADER-DG methods on collocated grids for compressible
   fluids (2) spectral semi-implicit and spectral space-time DG methods on
   edge-based staggered grids for the incompressible Navier-Stokes
   equations. In this work, the high-resolution properties of the
   aforementioned numerical methods are significantly enhanced within a
   `cell-by-cell' Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) implementation together
   with time accurate local time stepping (LTS). It is a well known fact
   that a major weakness of high order DG methods lies in the difficulty of
   limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate spurious oscillations,
   namely the so-called `Gibbs phenomenon'. Over the years, several
   attempts have been made to cope with this problem and different kinds of
   limiters have been proposed. In this work the nonlinear stabilization of
   the scheme is sequentially and locally introduced only for troubled
   cells on the basis of a multidimensional optimal order detection (MOOD)
   criterion. ADER-DG is a novel, communication-avoiding family of
   algorithms, which achieves high order of accuracy in time not via the
   standard multi-stage Runge-Kutta (RK) time discretization like most
   other DG schemes, but at the aid of an element-local predictor stage. In
   practice the method first produces a so-called candidate solution by
   using a high order accurate unlimited DG scheme. Then, in those cells
   where at least one of the chosen admissibility criteria is violated the
   computed candidate solution is detected as troubled and is locally
   rejected. Next, the numerical solution of the previous time step is
   scattered onto cell averages on a suitable sub-grid in order to preserve
   the natural sub-cell resolution of the DG scheme. Then, a more reliable
   numerical solution is recomputed a posteriori by employing a more robust
   but still very accurate ADER-WENO finite volume scheme on the sub-grid
   averages within that troubled cell. Finally, a high order DG polynomial
   is reconstructed back from the evolved sub-cell averages. In the ADER-DG
   framework several PDE system are investigated, ranging from the Euler
   equations of compressible gas dynamics, over the viscous and resistive
   magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), to special and general relativistic MHD.
   Indeed, the adopted formalism is quite general, leading to a novel
   family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes suitable for hyperbolic systems of
   partial differential equations in which the numerical fluxes also depend
   on the gradient of the state vector because of the parabolic nature of
   diffusive terms. The presented results show clearly that the
   high-resolution and shock-capturing capabilities of the news schemes are
   significantly enhanced within the cell-by-cell AMR implementation
   together with time accurate LTS. A special treatment has been followed
   for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In fact, the elliptic
   character of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations introduces an
   important difficulty in their numerical solution: whenever the smallest
   physical or numerical perturbation arises in the fluid flow then it will
   instantaneously affect the entire computational domain. Thus, a
   semi-implicit approach has been used.
   The main advantage of making use of a semi-implicit discretization is
   that the numerical stability can be obtained for large time-steps
   without leading to an excessive computational demand. In this context,
   we derived two new families of spectral semi-implicit and spectral
   space-time DG methods for the solution of the two and three dimensional
   Navier-Stokes equations on edge-based adaptive staggered Cartesian
   grids. The discrete solutions of pressure and velocity are expressed in
   the form of piecewise polynomials along different meshes. While the
   pressure is defined on the control volumes of the main grid, the
   velocity components are defined on edge-based dual control volumes,
   leading to a spatially staggered mesh. In the first family, high order
   of accuracy is achieved only in space, while a simple semi-implicit time
   discretization is derived by introducing an implicitness factor theta is
   an element of{[}0.5,1] for the pressure gradient in the momentum
   equation. The real advantages of the staggering arise after substituting
   the discrete momentum equation into the weak form of the continuity
   equation. In fact, the resulting linear system for the pressure is
   symmetric and positive definite and either block penta-diagonal (in 2D)
   or block hepta-diagonal (in 3D). As a consequence, the pressure system
   can be solved very efficiently by means of a classical matrix-free
   conjugate gradient method. The resulting algorithm is stable,
   computationally very efficient, and at the same time arbitrary high
   order accurate in both space and time. This new numerical method has
   been thoroughly validated for approximation polynomials of degree up to
   N=12, using a large set of non-trivial test problems in two and three
   space dimensions, for which either analytical, numerical or experimental
   reference solutions exist.},
