Abstract = {Maritime activities are one of the important sources of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. By 2050, the GHG emissions are expected to increase by
   at least 50\% over the 2007 levels. The currently practiced GHG emission
   mitigation measures include adoption of appropriate energy sources
   including conventional, renewable, and alternative energy sources or
   their blends; development and application of cleaner technological and
   operational mechanisms; adoption of intermodal shifting and demand
   management-based approaches; and development of sustainable shipping
   governance system. Each mitigation measure is related to certain
   implementation challenges. This study investigated different estimations
   of GHG emissions, the relevant mitigation options, and associated
   challenges, and analysed a possible international mitigation governance
   system, and proposed approaches to overcome barriers of mitigation
   options. It is concluded that the pertinent global community should take
   initiatives to improve the understanding of respective merits of
   different mitigation options, establish reduction potential and
   effectiveness of each viable measure, and assess the potential impacts
   of mitigation measures with particular reference to the global trade and
   market distortions. The persuasive cooperation with strong commitment
   among decision makers and stakeholders will best ensure development and
   implementation of sustainable mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Concerns about waste generation and climate change have attracted
   worldwide attention. Small islands, which account for more than
   one-sixth of the global land area, are facing problems caused by global
   climate change. This study evaluated the greenhouse gas emissions from
   five small islands surrounding Taiwan. These islands - Penghu County,
   Liuqui Island, Kinmen County, Matsu Island and Green Island - have their
   own waste management approaches that can serve as a guideline for waste
   management with greenhouse gas mitigation. The findings indicate that
   the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of the islands ranged from
   292.1 to 29,096.2{[}metric] tonne CO2-equivalent. The loading waste
   volumes and shipping distances were positively related to greenhouse gas
   emissions from transportation. The greenhouse gas emissions from
   waste-to-energy plants, mainly carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, can be
   offset by energy recovery (approximately 38.6\% of greenhouse gas
   emissions from incineration). In addition, about 34\% and 11\% of waste
   generated on the islands was successfully recycled and composted,
   respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the
   applicability of a policy framework for waste management approaches for
   greenhouse gas mitigation.},

Abstract = {Emissions of a broad range of greenhouse gases of varying lifetimes
   contribute to global climate change. Carbon dioxide displays exceptional
   persistence that renders its warming nearly irreversible for more than
   1,000 y. Here we show that the warming due to non-CO2 greenhouse gases,
   although not irreversible, persists notably longer than the
   anthropogenic changes in the greenhouse gas concentrations themselves.
   We explore why the persistence of warming depends not just on the decay
   of a given greenhouse gas concentration but also on climate system
   behavior, particularly the timescales of heat transfer linked to the
   ocean. For carbon dioxide and methane, nonlinear optical absorption
   effects also play a smaller but significant role in prolonging the
   warming. In effect, dampening factors that slow temperature increase
   during periods of increasing concentration also slow the loss of energy
   from the Earth's climate system if radiative forcing is reduced.
   Approaches to climate change mitigation options through reduction of
   greenhouse gas or aerosol emissions therefore should not be expected to
   decrease climate change impacts as rapidly as the gas or aerosol
   lifetime, even for short-lived species; such actions can have their
   greatest effect if undertaken soon enough to avoid transfer of heat to
   the deep ocean.},

Abstract = {Some of the main features of Vietnam's forests including the areas and
   annual growth rates of major forest types are described. The COMAP model
   is used to assess greenhouse gas mitigation options including three
   forestry options: a) Long-term rotation reforestation using species such
   as teak, b) short-term rotation reforestation using species such as
   eucalypts, acacias or pine and c) afforestation of coastal protection
   forests using species such as Casuarina equisetifolia. A cost of
   emission reduction initiatives (CERI) graph is used to show the relative
   costs and sequestration benefits of these options. It is concluded that
   the forestry sector has great potential to mitigate greenhouse gas
   emissions. There is a need to initiate significant pilot scale forestry
   mitigation options to demonstrate their feasibility, as well as to
   develop appropriate methods for assessing greenhouse gas flows and their
   verifiability.},

   in the Canadian agricultural sector},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-78},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article presents a methodological framework for strategic
   environmental assessment (SEA) application. The overall objective is to
   demonstrate SEA as a systematic and structured policy, plan, and program
   (PPP) decision support tool. In order to accomplish this objective, a
   stakeholder-based SEA application to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation
   policy options in Canadian agriculture is presented. Using a mail-out
   impact assessment exercise, agricultural producers and nonproducers from
   across the Canadian prairie region were asked to evaluate five competing
   GHG mitigation options against 13 valued environmental components
   (VECs). Data were analyzed using multi-criteria and exploratory
   analytical techniques. The results suggest considerable variation in
   perceived impacts and GHG mitigation policy preferences, suggesting that
   a blanket policy approach to GHG mitigation will create gainers and
   losers based on soil type and associate cropping and on-farm management
   practices. It is possible to identify a series of regional greenhouse
   gas mitigation programs that are robust, socially meaningful, and
   operationally relevant to both agricultural producers and policy
   decision makers. The assessment demonstrates the ability of SEA to
   address, in an operational sense, environmental problems that are
   characterized by conflicting interests and competing objectives and
   alternatives. A structured and systematic SEA methodology provides the
   necessary decision support framework for the consideration of impacts,
   and allows for PPPs to be assessed based on a much broader set of
   properties, objectives, criteria, and constraints whereas maintaining
   rigor and accountability in the assessment process.},

Abstract = {The observed increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse
   gases since the industrial period, due to human activities, is very
   likely causing the warming of the climate system. Anthropogenic warming
   and rising sea levels will continue for centuries due to the time scales
   associated with climate processes and feedbacks. Even if greenhouse gas
   concentrations were to be stabilized, different types of adaptation
   measures are needed to cope with the inevitable change. At the same time
   mitigation measures aiming at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and
   enhancing carbon sinks must be taken in order to reduce the potential
   extent of global warming. This chapter covers the main aspects of the
   current understanding of the physical basis of climate change, including
   the directly measured observations and estimated projections for the
   21st century. Causes and effects of climate change are also addressed.
   Finally, the main uncertainties of climate projections and a few general
   considerations on the different ways to respond to the climate change
   issue are discussed.},

Abstract = {Prompted with the ongoing and projected climate change, a wide range of
   cities have committed, not only to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but
   also to implement different climate change adaptation measures. These
   measures serve to ensure the wellbeing of the urban population. In
   practice, however, the planning of realistic adaptation measures is a
   complex process. Prior to starting such endeavor, it may therefore be
   useful to explore the maximum potential benefit that can be gained
   through adaptation measures. In this work, simple, extreme yet realistic
   adaptation measures are proposed in terms of changes in albedo and
   vegetation fraction. The impact of these land-use scenarios is explored
   by use of the land surface model SURFEX on the summer climate in terms
   of heat waves and the urban heat island for the city of Brussels. This
   is done for different periods in the future using the greenhouse gas
   scenario RCP8.5.},

Abstract = {Scientific records provide clear evidence of rising atmospheric
   greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations. Global warming and rising extreme
   weather events are believed to be a result. Besides proactively
   combating global climate change, transport agencies may need to develop
   strategies for better preparedness of the impacts of climate change.
   This is particularly important for certain regions that are more
   vulnerable to the potential damages caused by climate change. A
   methodological framework for developing such strategies is presented in
   the paper. The framework is illustrated through two examples: the
   management of rural roads in Thailand where the vast road network is
   being threatened by increasing floods and rising sea levels and the
   improvement of pavement design strategies for expressways along the
   coast of Hong Kong. Adaption measures are proposed for the highway
   agencies to address the challenges caused by climate change. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The present study aims to provide a methodological framework to assess
   comparatively the specific mitigation and adaptation measures against
   climate change, focusing on specific parameters which differentiate
   these alternatives, leading to the most efficient bundle of measures for
   an area under consideration. The selection of the ``optimal{''} sequence
   of measures is a sophisticated procedure and a multicriteria decision
   making process was established regarding this study, both for mitigation
   and adaptation measures. Mitigation options aim to minimise CO2
   emissions and greenhouse gas emissions in general, in order to decrease
   their concentration levels, as well as to drop the increase rate of
   global temperature, i.e. actions contributing to the mitigation of the
   greenhouse gas emissions, or the increase of their storage tanks.
   Indicatively, ``Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology{''} and
   ``Biogas utilisation methods{''} are among the mitigation measures under
   study. On the other hand, adaptation measures are defined as the ability
   of the natural or human systems to handle the impact of the climate
   change and to adjust to its effects, aiming to eliminate the
   consequences and take advantage of any beneficial outcomes. Adaptation
   measures are also considered in this study, such as the ``Embankments in
   coastal areas{''} and the ``Switch to biological cultivations and
   application of a complete culture management method{''}.
   A questionnaire was designed for the above purposes, in order to provide
   qualitative information necessary to compare mitigation and adaptation
   options in an overall framework assessment, based on specific decision
   criteria. Climate change experts and scientists gave their feedback via
   a face-to-face interview. The basic tool for the assessment during the
   present study was the ELECTRE III multicriteria analysis methodology.
   ELECTRE III fits best to complex environmental problems such as
   confronting/adapting to climate change and relative decision making. A
   comparative assessment and an ``optimal{''} sequence of mitigation and
   adaptation measures, in order to confront climate change is provided.
   The application of the multicriteria analysis was conducted using
   ELECTRE III software. Interesting results are derived from the
   application of ELECTRE III and alongside conclusions are made, depending
   on the differences among the various scenarios applied.},

   warming effects of greenhouse gases},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gases other than CO2 make a significant contribution to
   human-induced climate change, and multi-gas mitigation strategies are
   cheaper to implement than those which limit CO2 emissions alone. Most
   practical multi-gas mitigation strategies require metrics to relate the
   climate warming effects of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Global
   warming potential (GWP), defined as the ratio of time-integrated
   radiative forcing of a particular gas to that of CO2 following a unit
   mass emission, is the metric used in the Kyoto Protocol, and we define
   mean global temperature change potential (MGTP) as an equivalent metric
   of the temperature response. Here we show that carbon-climate feedbacks
   inflate the GWPs and MGTPs of methane and nitrous oxide by similar to
   20\% in coupled carbon-climate model simulations of the response to a
   pulse of 50 x 1990 emissions, due to a warming-induced release of CO2
   from the land biosphere and ocean. The magnitude of this effect is
   expected to be dependent on the model, but it is not captured at all by
   the analytical models usually used to calculate metrics such as GWP. We
   argue that the omission of carbon cycle dynamics has led to a low bias
   of uncertain but potentially substantial magnitude in metrics of the
   global warming effect of other greenhouse gases, and we suggest that the
   carbon-climate feedback should be considered when greenhouse gas metrics
   are calculated and applied.},

Title = {Committed sea-level rise under the Paris Agreement and the legacy of
   delayed mitigation action},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise is a major consequence of climate change that will
   continue long after emissions of greenhouse gases have stopped. The 2015
   Paris Agreement aims at reducing climate-related risks by reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions to net zero and limiting global-mean
   temperature increase. Here we quantify the effect of these constraints
   on global sea-level rise until 2300, including Antarctic ice-sheet
   instabilities. We estimate median sea-level rise between 0.7 and 1.2 m,
   if net-zero greenhouse gas emissions are sustained until 2300, varying
   with the pathway of emissions during this century. Temperature
   stabilization below 2 degrees C is insufficient to hold median sea-level
   rise until 2300 below 1.5 m. We find that each 5-year delay in near-term
   peaking of CO2 emissions increases median year 2300 sea-level rise
   estimates by ca. 0.2 m, and extreme sea-level rise estimates at the 95th
   percentile by up to 1 m. Our results underline the importance of
   near-term mitigation action for limiting long-term sea-level rise risks.},

   the most appropriate technology for capture of CO2 depends upon the type
   of power plant and proven technology available. However, capture of CO2
   adds substantially to the cost of power generation and reduces plant
   efficiency. In contrast, storage of CO2, e.g. in the ocean, is unproven
   but relatively inexpensive. There are major uncertainties about storage,
   in particular long-range environmental impacts and security. Utilisation
   of CO2 such as making chemicals has a limited potential. Copyright (C)

Title = {Urban planning policy must do more to integrate climate change
   adaptation and mitigation actions},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {101},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Well-designed urban planning policy can mitigate greenhouse gas
   emissions and adapt to anticipated climate change impacts. However,
   there has been limited analysis of the extent to which urban planning
   policy documents addresses climate change adaptation and or mitigation.
   There is a need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit
   warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, and to be
   well adapted to this change (in line with the Paris Agreement).
   Achieving this goal will assist in limiting damage and loss to humans
   and the natural environment. This paper presents a detailed qualitative
   and quantitative evaluation of urban planning documents (policy,
   regulation and law) in the state of Victoria, Australia, and the degree
   to which climate change mitigation and adaptation (with a focus on sea
   level rise) are addressed and integrated. Two scales of government
   (state and local) were analysed across three policy disciplines (urban
   planning, climate change and flood management). The evaluation framework
   contributes to the few tools for analyzing legislation, regulation and
   strategic policies for climate change adequacy. The findings reveal
   limited climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in urban
   planning documents. Additionally, there is limited integration of
   adaptation and mitigation actions. Important opportunities for better
   alignment of policies across disciplines and government levels in line
   Paris Agreement goals are identified, to ensure implementation in
   decisions made about land use and development. The analysis finds that
   urban planning policy must do more to include and integrate climate

   Management},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have caused global temperatures to rise since
   the mid-20th century accompanied by sea-level rise (SLR). Temperature
   increases and SLR-induced groundwater rise have been shown to cause
   premature pavement failure in many roadway structures. Hybrid
   bottom-up/top-down (hybrid) adaptation approaches have shown promise by
   initially investigating an asset's response to incremental environmental
   change and then identifying the timing of critical effects for budgetary
   planning. This improves practitioners' understanding of the asset's
   climate resiliency and informs adaptation-plan development to minimize
   both cost and risk. In this study, a hybrid approach to pavement
   adaptation with climate-change-induced temperature and groundwater rise
   is demonstrated at a case-study site in coastal New Hampshire. The
   hot-mix-asphalt (HMA) thickness that achieves a minimum of 85\%
   reliability is calculated for 70 combinations of incremental temperature
   and groundwater rise. Increasing the base-layer thickness improves
   resiliency against rising temperatures, but rising groundwater
   diminishes this improvement demonstrating that both HMA and base-layer
   thickness increases are needed. Thirteen adaptation pathways are
   evaluated for pavement performance, life-cycle costs, and road-surface
   inundation over a 60-year pavement management period. A stepwise and
   flexible adaptation plan is developed that includes HMA overlays with
   prescribed thickness and application timing, base-layer rehabilitation
   options, and re-evaluation opportunities.},

Abstract = {Our aim in this paper is to describe an opportunity for physics students
   and faculty to learn about an environmental issue of much current
   interest: the quantification, or footprint analysis, of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and reactive nitrogen emissions. These can originate from human
   activities such as energy use, food consumption, and transportation, and
   are among the greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global warming
   and rising sea levels. Moreover, nitrogen compounds also have effects on
   the chemistry and biology of the environment. Analyzing both of these
   footprints together captures multiple environmental impacts from the
   local to the global levels and can suggest mitigation strategies. We
   focus on the experiences of interdisciplinary teams, which included
   physics students and faculty, and that used the leading greenhouse gas
   analysis platform SIMAP (Sustainability Indicator Management and
   Analysis Platform).},

Title = {Hydrologic Restoration Decreases Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Shrub Bog
   Peatlands in Southeastern US},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Peatlands play a disproportionate role in the global carbon cycle.
   However, many peatlands have been ditched to lower the water table and
   converted into agriculture, which contributes to anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrologic restoration of drained peatlands
   could offset greenhouse gas emissions from these actions, but field
   examples that consider various greenhouse gases are still rare. Here, we
   examined emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) from soils in drained shrub bogs in North Carolina, USA,
   before and after hydrologic restoration. We used static chamber methods
   and a before-and-after, control-impact (BACI) experimental design. We
   found that hydrologic manipulation (akin to restoration) increased water
   table levels by 65\%, even with the impact of two hurricanes before and
   one after hydrologic manipulation. Increased water table levels led to a
   58\% decrease in CO2 fluxes, and an increase in CH4 (251\%) and N2O
   fluxes (85\%). Water table depth and soil temperature explained 43\% of
   variation in CO2, while water table depth explained 25\% and 18\% of
   variation in CH4 and N2O fluxes, respectively. Despite the increases in
   CH4 and N2O, the higher magnitude of fluxes and large decline in CO2
   lead to an overall lowering of greenhouse gas emissions after hydrologic
   restoration. Our results suggest that raising the water table in this
   shrub bog peatland decreased overall greenhouse gas emissions,
   illustrating that hydrologic restoration of peatlands can be a valuable
   climate mitigation practice.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN GEO-ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274-285},

Abstract = {Certain gases that are capable of trapping heat in the Earth's
   atmosphere are known as ``greenhouse gas{''} and are important for
   helping to regulate temperature. Major greenhouse gases include carbon
   dioxide, methane, water vapor, chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide.
   Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide as a combustion product and
   atmospheric concentrations have increased dramatically over the past two
   centuries. The heat trapped by this additional greenhouse gas is
   changing climates, melting ice sheets and glaciers in polar regions,
   raising sea levels, and affecting ocean currents. Climate change can be
   mitigated by preventing the emission of additional fossil fuel
   combustion products to the atmosphere and reducing existing greenhouse
   gas levels back to pre-industrial revolution concentrations. This
   requires switching energy production to sustainable, nonfossil sources
   and applying carbon capture, use, and storage technology on the fossil
   fuel combustion that remains. The implementation of direct air capture
   technology to reduce existing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
   can further remediate climate impacts. Captured carbon dioxide can be
   stored in plant tissues, soils, deep underground in geological
   repositories, or as solid materials like concrete or carbonates to keep
   it from reentering the atmosphere. Although non-carbon energy sources
   have recently become more cost-competitive with fossil energy,
   technological advancements and government policies are still needed to
   overcome the inherent economic advantages of fossil fuels. A global
   strategy must be developed to convince people that the higher cost of
   clean, sustainable energy is a price worth paying to replace fossil
   fuels and prevent a major environmental calamity.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Given the importance of the environment around the world and its
   accelerating destruction brought on by the increase in emissions
   resulting from the growing use of various forms of transportation, this
   paper shall aim to eliminate this research gap via a thorough
   investigation of the literature. These goals include the effect of
   greenhouse gases emitted by the transportation industry on the
   environment, the impact of pollutants on transportation mode choice, a
   study of the obstacles to reducing pollution in transportation, and the
   presentation of solutions and suggestions. In the research, papers
   related to this topic in various transportation industries, including
   road, rail, marine, air, and multimodal transportation, and the
   variables affecting the control of greenhouse gas emissions in any mode
   of transportation were collected. Afterward, fundamental analysis was
   carried out, conclusions drawn, and the presentation of suggestions and
   solutions in this area addressed. Reducing greenhouse gases in
   transportation is a challenge that requires examining numerous
   influential variables and factors. The studies presented in this
   research are expected to be useful, especially for the energy activists,
   researchers, and policymakers who would like to conduct long-term
   studies of pollutants in the transportation industry and the variables
   influencing the control of greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2022 The

Journal = {ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Background: The accelerating accumulation of greenhouse gases in the
   Earth's atmosphere is changing global environmental conditions in
   unprecedented and potentially irreversible ways. Climate change poses a
   host of challenges to the health of populations through complex direct
   and indirect mechanisms. The direct effects include an increased
   frequency of heat waves, rising sea levels that threaten low-lying
   communities, anticipated extremes in the global hydrologic cycle
   (droughts, floods, and intense storms), and adverse effects on
   agricultural production and fisheries due to environmental stressors and
   changes in land use. Indirectly, climate change is anticipated to
   threaten health by worsening urban air pollution and increasing rates of
   infectious (particularly waterborne and vector-borne) disease
   transmission.
   Objective: To provide a state-of-the-science review on the health
   consequences of a changing climate.
   Findings: Environmental public health researchers have concluded that,
   on balance, adverse health outcomes will dominate under these changed
   climatic conditions. The number of pathways through which climate change
   can affect the health of populations makes this environmental health
   threat one of the largest and most formidable of the new century.
   Geographic location plays an influential role the potential for adverse
   health effects caused by climate change, and certain regions and
   populations are more vulnerable than others to expected health effects.
   Two kinds of strategies are available for responding to climate change:
   mitigation policies (which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) and
   adaptation measures (relating to preparedness for anticipated impacts).
   Conclusions: To better understand and address the complex nature of
   health risks posed by climate change, interdisciplinary collaboration is
   critical. Efforts to move beyond our current reliance on fossil fuels to
   cleaner, more sustainable energy sources may offer some of the greatest
   health opportunities in more than a century and cobenefits beyond the
   health sector. Because the nations least responsible for climate change
   are most vulnerable to its effects, the challenge to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions is not merely technical, but also moral.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gases (GHG), the main contributors to global warming are
   currently ranked amongst the most serious threats to the world's
   environment and social and economic development. GHG, and carbon dioxide
   in particular, are emitted from the transportation as well as other
   energy conversion sectors. This paper presents a comprehensive approach
   for conducting GHG emissions inventories from transportation in
   developing countries, and introducing the most appropriate mitigation
   options. The evaluation process is initiated by an inventory of GHG
   emissions in the base year. The inventory included all sectors of
   transportation: Land, sea, and air. Short- and long-term projections are
   then conducted taken into consideration the economic and social indices
   and the existing plans and regulations. Mitigation options applicable
   for Lebanon and for countries with similar social and economic
   conditions are examined and the most feasible ones are compared in terms
   of costs and profits. The paper concludes that applicable mitigation
   measures are dependent on the social and economic status of the country.},

Abstract = {There is a common perception that, if human societies make the
   significant adjustments necessary to substantively cut emissions of
   greenhouse gases, global temperature increases could be stabilized, and
   the most dangerous consequences of climate change could be avoided. Here
   we show results from global coupled climate model simulations with the
   new representative concentration pathway mitigation scenarios to 2300 to
   illustrate that, with aggressive mitigation in two of the scenarios,
   globally averaged temperature increase indeed could be stabilized either
   below 2 degrees C or near 3 degrees C above pre-industrial values.
   However, even as temperatures stabilize, sea level would continue to
   rise. With little mitigation, future sea-level rise would be large and
   continue unabated for centuries. Though sea-level rise cannot be stopped
   for at least the next several hundred years, with aggressive mitigation
   it can be slowed down, and this would buy time for adaptation measures
   to be adopted.},

Abstract = {The urban heat island effect (UHI) is a product of urbanization and in
   certain climates can lead to increased use of energy for cooling, and
   increased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Global warming is also a
   product of human activities, and the climate change that comes with it
   poses a threat to both humankind and the planet. There is thus a link
   between urban warming and climate change. As this problem has at least
   in part been created by cities the solution should also be addressed
   there. Mitigation and adaptation strategies for global warming and the
   UHI conflict with each other in many aspects, particularly in land use.
   Compact urban development has been proposed as a means of reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions by reducing car use, while expanding green
   spaces, and hence increasing distances between places, is a UHI
   adaptation strategy. This paper aims to track the land use changes in
   the city of Mashhad in northern Iran and the impact of these on land
   surface temperature as a first step in recommending strategies for
   reducing UHI in Iranian cities.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {A transition from the global system of coal-based electricity generation
   to low-greenhouse-gas-emission energy technologies is required to
   mitigate climate change in the long term. The use of current
   infrastructure to build this new low-emission system necessitates
   additional emissions of greenhouse gases, and the coal-based
   infrastructure will continue to emit substantial amounts of greenhouse
   gases as it is phased out. Furthermore, ocean thermal inertia delays the
   climate benefits of emissions reductions. By constructing a quantitative
   model of energy system transitions that includes life-cycle emissions
   and the central physics of greenhouse warming, we estimate the global
   warming expected to occur as a result of build-outs of new energy
   technologies ranging from 100 GW(e) to 10 TWe in size and 1-100 yr in
   duration. We show that rapid deployment of low-emission energy systems
   can do little to diminish the climate impacts in the first half of this
   century. Conservation, wind, solar, nuclear power, and possibly carbon
   capture and storage appear to be able to achieve substantial climate
   benefits in the second half of this century; however, natural gas
   cannot.},

Abstract = {Africa is one of the regions of the world potentially most vulnerable to
   climate change. Warming of the globe due to increased atmospheric
   concentrations of greenhouse gases appears to be inevitable. Therefore,
   it is imperative that policy makers in regions such as Africa begin to
   consider what measures they should take to adapt to the potential
   conseqences of climate change. A number of adaptation policies are
   suggested here. The policies address general adaptation measures as well
   as specific measures in water resources, coastal resources (adapting to
   sea-level rise), forests, ecosystems, and agriculture. These measures
   would enhance the flexibility of resources to adapt to climate change
   and would have net benefits greater than costs. In some cases, the
   measures make sense without considering climate change because they help
   address current climate variability. In other cases, the measures must
   be implemented in anticipation of climate change because they would be
   ineffective if implemented as a reaction to climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate change is causing increases in temperature, changes in
   precipitation and extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other
   environmental impacts. It is also causing or contributing to
   heat-related disorders, respiratory and allergic disorders, infectious
   diseases, malnutrition due to food insecurity, and mental health
   disorders. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that climate
   change is causally associated with collective violence, generally in
   combination with other causal factors. Increased temperatures and
   extremes of precipitation with their associated consequences, including
   resultant scarcity of cropland and other key environmental resources,
   are major pathways by which climate change leads to collective violence.
   Public health professionals can help prevent collective violence due to
   climate change (a) by supporting mitigation measures to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions, (b) by promoting adaptation measures to
   address the consequences of climate change and to improve community
   resilience, and (c) by addressing underlying risk factors for collective
   violence, such as poverty and socioeconomic disparities.},

Abstract = {new ensemble of simulations from the Earth System configuration of the
   Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version 2 (HadGEM2-ES), is
   used to evaluate the response to historical and projected future
   greenhouse gas forcings that follow Representative Concentration
   Pathways (RCPs). In addition to the projected changes during the
   twenty-first century, extended simulations to the year 2300 allow an
   investigation into inertia in the climate system post-2100 that may
   occur even if atmospheric CO2 concentrations have stabilized.
   Projections of temperature, precipitation, sea level, permafrost, heat
   waves, and compatible carbon emissions are analyzed. The low emissions
   scenario RCP2.6 is the only scenario considered here that is
   approximately consistent with a 2 degrees C global warming limit, though
   there are regions where local changes in temperature are projected to
   considerably exceed 2 degrees C, particularly over northern
   high-latitude areas. An aggressive mitigation approach, represented here
   by RCP2.6, could contribute to avoiding the larger-magnitude future
   climate changes projected under higher emissions scenarios. Despite
   these benefits, changes should still be expected under an aggressive
   mitigation pathway and may require adaptation.},

Title = {Impact of microplastics on riverine greenhouse gas emissions: a view
   point},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {In recent decades, microplastics (MPs < 5 mm) are ubiquitous and
   considered a serious emerging environmental problem. However, due to the
   limited recovery and long-lasting durability MPs, debris is frequently
   accumulating in riverine ecosystems, thereby impacting microbial
   activity and its communities. The presence of MPs may alter the
   microbial richness, variety, and population, thereby impacting the
   transformation of biogeochemical cycles. The occurrence, fate, and
   transport of MPs in marine and terrestrial ecosystems and their impact
   on biogeochemical or nutrient cycling are reported in the scientific
   fraternity. Yet, the global scientific community is conspicuously devoid
   of research on impact of MPs on riverine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   The presented view point provides a novel idea about the fate of MPs in
   the riverine system and its impact on GHG emissions potential.
   Literature reveals that DO and nutrients (organic carbon, NH4+, NO3-)
   concentrations play an important role in potential of GHG emission in
   riverine ecosystems. The proposed mechanism and research gaps provided
   will be highly helpful to the hydrologist, environmentalist,
   biotechnologist, and policymakers to think about the strategic
   mitigation measure to resolve the future climatic risk.},

Abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to analyse climate change impacts, and
   climate risk management in Africa. Although African emissions have
   played a minor role in the build-up of greenhouse gases in today's
   atmosphere, Africa has been suffering from rising temperatures and
   evaporation, widespread water stress, increased frequency and severity
   of droughts and floods, crop loss, rising sea level, decline in
   biodiversity, higher level of disease, and conflicts over access to land
   and water. Unless the greenhouse gases emissions are reduced
   significantly, Africa will continue to suffer from the adverse effects
   of climate change, as it has low capacity to cope with such phenomena.
   In spite of this, national governments and the local people in Africa
   have used various strategies to tackle the adverse consequences of
   climate change. African countries have tried to address the problems of
   climate variability and change by introducing national and regional
   mitigation strategies. Peasant farmers and pastoralists have been coping
   with environmental hazards, and adapting their livelihoods to changing
   conditions for generations. However, indigenous mechanisms are not
   sufficient by themselves to deal with the effects of climate change;
   they should be complemented by modem strategies. This chapter, thus,
   suggests that policy makers, modern scientists and peasant farmers have
   to work together to address the adverse effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful atmospheric greenhouse gas and cause
   of ozone layer depletion. Global emissions continue to rise. More than
   two-thirds of these emissions arise from bacterial and fungal
   denitrification and nitrification processes in soils, largely as a
   result of the application of nitrogenous fertilizers. This article
   summarizes the outcomes of an interdisciplinary meeting, `Nitrous oxide
   (N2O) the forgotten greenhouse gas', held at the Kavli Royal Society
   International Centre, from 23 to 24 May 2011. It provides an
   introduction and background to the nature of the problem, and summarizes
   the conclusions reached regarding the biological sources and sinks of
   N2O in oceans, soils and wastewaters, and discusses the genetic
   regulation and molecular details of the enzymes responsible. Techniques
   for providing global and local N2O budgets are discussed. The findings
   of the meeting are drawn together in a review of strategies for
   mitigating N2O emissions, under three headings, namely: (i) managing
   soil chemistry and microbiology, (ii) engineering crop plants to fix
   nitrogen, and (iii) sustainable agricultural intensification.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a global persistent threat to fish and fish habitats
   throughout North America. Climate-induced modification of environmental
   regimes, including changes in streamflow, water temperature, salinity,
   storm surges, and habitat connectivity can change fish physiology,
   disrupt spawning cues, cause fish extinctions and invasions, and alter
   fish community structure. Reducing greenhouse emissions remains the
   primary mechanism to slow the pace of climate change, but local and
   regional management agencies and stakeholders have developed an arsenal
   of adaptation strategies to help partially mitigate the effects of
   climate change on fish. We summarize common stressors posed by climate
   change in North America, including (1) increased water temperature, (2)
   changes in precipitation, (3) sea level rise, and (4) ocean
   acidification, and present potential adaptation strategies that fishery
   professionals may apply to help vulnerable fish and fisheries cope with
   a changing climate. Although our adaptation strategies are primarily
   from North America, they have broader geographic applicability to fish
   and aquatic biota in other jurisdictions. These strategies provide
   opportunities for managers to mitigate the effects of climate change on
   fish and fish habitat while needed global policies to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions emerge, which may offer more lasting solutions.},

Abstract = {The IEA Greenhouse gas R\&D programme is an international collaboration
   supported by 16 countries and several industrial organisations. During
   the first three years (phase 1) the programme has evaluated technologies
   for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from power stations. The main
   types of fossil fuel power plant were investigated and the costs and
   emissions associated with power generation were calculated. Technologies
   for capturing CO2, were then evaluated with reference to the power
   generation technologies. Once captured and compressed, storage,
   transportation and utilisation of carbon dioxide was studied.
   It was found that the most appropriate technology for capture of CO2
   depends upon the type of power plant and in most cases proven technology
   is available to carry this out. Capture of CO2 adds substantially to the
   cost of power generation and reduces plant efficiency. In contrast,
   storage of CO2, in deep aquifers, the oceans or in exhausted oil and gas
   fields is unproven but would be relatively inexpensive. There are major
   uncertainties about disposal, in particular in terms of environmental
   impact and long term security of storage. Utilisation of CO2, in the
   manufacture of chemicals, has only a limited potential capacity for
   carbon sequestration. The second phase of the programme has now
   commenced, developed in the light of key issues identified in the first
   phase. Such key issues are; can the cost of capture be substantially
   reduced? How can the uncertainties of disposal be reduced? What are the
   full fuel cycle costs of mitigation technologies? How effective are
   means of mitigating emissions of other greenhouse gases?
   Major elements of the phase 2 programme include:
   Methane emissions from the: Coal industry Oil and gas industry Landfills
   Other anthropogenic sources
   power generation/radical approaches to CO2 capture advanced separation
   techniques ocean storage full fuel cycle studies.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how California may reduce transportation
   greenhouse as emissions 80\% below 1990 levels by 2050 (i.e., 80in50). A
   Kaya framework that decomposes greenhouse gas emissions into the product
   of population, transport intensity, energy intensity, and carbon
   intensity is used to analyze emissions and mitigation options. Each
   transportation subsector, including light-duty, heavy-duty, aviation,
   rail, marine, agriculture, and off-road vehicles. is analyzed to
   identify specific mitigation options and understand its potential for
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scenario analysis shows that, while
   California's 2050 target is ambitious, it can be achieved in transport
   if a concerted effort is made to change travel behavior and the vehicles
   and fuels that provide mobility. While no individual ``Silver Bullet{''}
   strategy exists that can achieve the goals, a portfolio approach that
   combines strategies could yield Success. The 80in50 scenarios show the
   impacts of advanced vehicle and fuels technologies as well as the role
   of travel demand reduction, which can significantly reduce energy and
   resource requirements and the level of technology development needed to
   meet the target. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Understanding ecosystem processes from a functional point of view is
   essential to study relationships among climate variability,
   biogeochemical cycles, and surface-atmosphere interactions. Increasingly
   during the last decades, the eddy covariance (EC) method has been
   applied in terrestrial, marine and urban ecosystems to quantify fluxes
   of greenhouse gases (e. g., CO2, H2O) and energy (e.g., sensible and
   latent heat). Networks of EC systems have been established in different
   regions and have provided scientific information that has been used for
   designing environmental and adaptation policies. In this context, this
   article outlines the conceptual and technical framework for the
   establishment of an EC regional network (i.e., MexFlux) to measure the
   surface-atmosphere exchange of heat and greenhouse gases in Mexico. The
   goal of the network is to improve our understanding of how climate
   variability and environmental change influence the dynamics of Mexican
   ecosystems. First, we discuss the relevance of CO2 and water vapor
   exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Second, we
   briefly describe the EC basis and present examples of measurements in
   terrestrial and urban ecosystems of Mexico. Finally, we describe the
   conceptual and operational goals at short-, medium-, and long-term
   scales for continuity of the MexFlux network.},

Abstract = {The waste management sector accounts for 19\% of greenhouse gases
   produced by the island of Mauritius, and is second to the energy sector
   which contributes about 77\% of total emissions. Significant mitigating
   measures are being sought to reduce the impact of the waste sector. The
   main greenhouse gas produced from waste in Mauritius is methane from
   landfill disposal. Among the different alternate waste management
   scenarios proposed, home composting is one strategy to achieve carbon
   reductions in the sector. However, this target can only be achieved if
   the composting process is properly controlled. Objectively, a lumped
   parameter model was used to analyse the set of variation parameters to
   achieve greatest reduction in methane through optimal composting. The
   composting matrix was modelled as a point source. Mass balance equations
   were coupled with heat transport equations and reaction kinetics
   equations to determine the optimal set of parameters for efficient
   composting of yard waste and kitchen waste. The simulations demonstrated
   that bulking of vegetable waste prior to composting is required to
   prevent production of methane.},

Pages = {247-260},
Abstract = {Climate-related changes represent potential additional stresses on the
   coastal ecosystems that are already under pressure from degradation and
   non-climatic pressure. The potential impact of these pressures on the
   coastal areas and livelihood of coastal communities necessitate the need
   for researchers, policymakers, residents, and other key stakeholders to
   work together to establish a framework for adaptation that is integrated
   within current coastal management processes and practices and takes a
   broader view of the subject. There are three important coastal
   adaptation strategies, viz. protection, accommodation, and retreat. All
   these measures involve technologies, often available or known to the
   scientific communities. The major challenge to adaptation is access to
   the adaptation measures, participation by all the stakeholders, and
   coordination at different levels. At the same time, mitigation methods
   are centred on adjustment or modification in transportation, shelter,
   food production, energy, and carbon storage and bioengineering. This
   chapter describes various options available for adaptation and
   mitigation strategies for natural as well as human-managed systems.},

Abstract = {One of the most pressing and globally recognized challenges is how to
   mitigate the effects of global environment change brought about by
   increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2. In this review
   we evaluate the potential contribution of four biological approaches to
   mitigating global environment change: reducing atmospheric CO2
   concentrations through soil carbon sequestration and afforestation;
   reducing predicted increases in global surface temperatures through
   increasing the albedo of crop plants; and fertilizing the oceans to
   increase primary productivity and CO2 drawdown. We conclude that none of
   these biological approaches are `magic bullets' capable of reversing
   environmental changes brought about by increasing emissions of
   greenhouse gases. However, it is possible that increasing crop albedo
   and soil carbon sequestration might contribute towards mitigation on a
   regional scale. In the absence of legally binding international
   agreements to reduce CO2 emissions, we propose that: increased efforts
   are made to identify novel biological mitigatory strategies; further
   research is conducted to minimise the uncertainties present in all four
   of the biological approaches described; and pilot-level field work is
   conducted to examine the feasibility of the most promising strategies.
   Finally, it is essential to engage with the public concerning strategies
   for mitigating the effects of climate change because the majority of the
   biological approaches have effects, quite possibly of a negative nature,
   on ecosystem services and land usage.},

Abstract = {Countries present at the COP15 United Nations Climate Change Conference
   Copenhagen 2009 have discussed on the standard of greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, but failed to reach an agreement. As the global climate
   problem turns to be severe, countries in Annex 1 in the Kyoto Protocol
   and European Union (EU) began to push the International Maritime
   Organization (IMO) to put the issue of reducing GHG emissions in
   shipping industry on the agenda and introduce a specific standard by
   2011. Moreover, in March 2009, the State Council of the People's
   Republic of China has issued a strategic policy on promoting Shanghai to
   be an international financial and shipping centre. Under such
   circumstance, this paper applied cost-benefit-analysis to analyse the
   feasibility of GHG emissions trading and raised proposals for
   corresponding actions for shipping companies' better adaption to the
   development of shipping industry and gain a favourable position in the
   carbon credits exchange market.},

Title = {The unusual suspects? Perception of underlying causes of anthropogenic

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Public perception of the underlying causes of anthropogenic climate
   change is a complex and subjective issue that is critical to effective
   risk communication. This issue is important to scientists and
   policymakers because of the role of individual perceptions in
   influencing their protective behaviour towards risk (e.g., the adoption
   of climate risk reduction and mitigation strategies). This
   cross-sectional study elucidated people's perceptions of the underlying
   causes of human-induced climate change in coastal communities in
   Cambodia and Tanzania. The multinomial logistic regression model was
   based on a geographically and demographically stratified national sample
   of 3,706 individuals conducted between March and September 2013. The
   distribution of the fundamental causes of anthropogenic climate change
   in the pooled sample was deforestation (29\%), overpopulation - births
   and immigration (18\%), greenhouse gas emissions (12\%), illegal
   resource extraction (14\%), and God's will and transgressing cultural
   norms (26\%). Few people in both countries believed that, the usual
   suspect, greenhouse gas emission was the fundamental cause of
   anthropogenic climate change. The number of poor rural residents who
   indicated that deforestation was the major underlying cause of climate
   change was approximately three times more than members of the same
   sub-group who noted that greenhouse gas emissions were the underlying
   cause of climate change. People who had tertiary education were less
   likely to consider God's will and transgressing cultural norms as the
   underlying cause of anthropogenic climate change rather than attributing
   it to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to
   mainstream climate change into educational curricula in both countries.},

Abstract = {Urbanization has been both a cause of global warming and a victim of it
   through the urban heat island effect. The main reason for global warming
   is enhanced greenhouse emissions in the atmosphere. At the same time,
   Iran, as one of main global producers of greenhouse gasses, has
   witnessed rapid urbanization and a dramatic increase in energy use.
   There may be a link here that needs further investigation to see whether
   urban design can be used to prevent cities being major producer of
   greenhouse gasses. Cities are a source of this growth in greenhouse
   gases mainly because of transportation and energy use in the building
   sector. In the past, urbanization did not produce this increase in
   energy use, suggesting modern urbanization is in complete contrast with
   traditional urban and architectural design principles. Climatic design
   has always been one of the most important principles of traditional
   architecture in Iran. Different climate zones have inspired traditional
   architecture, creating design solutions that made cities and buildings
   livable for people. This paper sets out how a passion for modernization
   and the subsequent rapid urbanization have changed the structure of
   Iranian cities and made them producers of greenhouse gasses and energy
   consumers. The paper discusses how adaptation and mitigation strategies
   are crucial countermeasures against urban warming, and how currently
   these remain completely neglected in urban planning and urban design
   processes in Iran. Finally, the paper concludes by describing how urban
   designers could intervene to achieve realistic improvements in Iranian
   urbanization.},

Title = {Implementation of Maritime Transport Mitigation Measures according to
   their marginal abatement costs and their mitigation potentials},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {160},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a target to reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by at least 50\% in 2050
   compared to 2008. Some studies focused on negative cost mitigation
   measures to achieve this goal, while it is almost a consensus that
   alternative maritime fuels with low or zero direct GHG emissions are
   needed. This article gathered data from implementation, marginal
   abatement costs (MAC) and mitigation potentials of 22 mitigation
   measures, to assess their implementation according to their MAC and GHG
   abatement potentials. Findings showed that measures with negative costs
   are more implemented than measures with positive costs, and that
   measures with negative costs have at least a 25\% of implementation
   rate, with one exception, and for some, this exceeds 50\%. Among the
   measures with high mitigation potential, only the use of alternative
   fuels without carbons measure has a low implementation rate.
   Nevertheless, it is crucial to reach the IMO's target. Hence, studies
   that analyze emission reduction scenarios should consider the
   implementation rate since there are still opportunities to overcome
   market barriers to measures with negative costs not yet fully
   implemented, especially with the approval of the EEXI and CII
   regulations.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The causal relationships among marine energy consumption, greenhouse gas
   emissions from international shipping, and economic growth for Kyoto
   Protocol Annex I countries for the period of 1990 to 2006 are discussed.
   The real gross domestic product is used as a proxy for economic
   activity. The United States is also discussed because it was the main
   global polluter before 2006. The co-integration methodology and an
   error-correction model are used to examine the causal relationships. The
   empirical results show that marine energy consumption and GDP are the
   main factors of increased GHG emissions in the short-run, and that
   economic activity significantly increased emissions in the long-run.
   Emissions from shipping are more closely related to marine energy
   consumption than to economic activity. Hence, policies for mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions from marine shipping need to focus on greater
   energy efficiency in the design of ship engines and hulls. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Rising sea level together with regionally increased storm activity,

   intensification of coastal defense measures, in particular strengthening
   dykes, and adaptation to intermittent flooding. in case of Hamburg and
   the tidal Elbe river a third option seems to be available, which aims at
   mitigating storm surge risks by applying estuary engineering
   constructions. This option is sketched in this paper. The option has the

Title = {The cost-effectiveness of CO2 mitigation measures for the
   decarbonisation of shipping. The case study of a globally operating
   ship-management company},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {316},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {The International Maritime Organisation has set a goal to achieve a 50\%
   reduction of the total annual greenhouse gas emissions related to the
   international shipping by 2050 compared to the 2008 baseline emissions.
   Thus, companies are looking for solutions and measures to align with the
   Organisation's goal. Marginal Abatement Cost Curves have been
   extensively used in the literature to rank several Greenhouse Gas
   mitigation measures based on their costs of reducing an additional unit
   of pollution. In this paper an expert-based, bottom-up approach was
   employed to construct Marginal Abatement Cost Curves for a globally
   operating ship-management company. Several mitigation measures were
   examined for the following vessel categories (a) Containerships 8000+
   TEU, (b) Containerships 2000-2999 TEU, (c) Bulkers 35000-59999 DWT, and
   (d) Gas Tankers <49999 CBM. Furthermore, the fuel price fluctuation and
   carbon taxation were used to investigate the sensitivity of baseline
   Marginal Abatement Cost Curves. The measures, which remain
   cost-effective under all sensitivity analyses, undergo a Pareto Analysis
   and a Marginal Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. The results suggest that
   most of the recommended mitigation measures are of an operational and
   technical nature, with exception the burning of Liquified Natural Gas
   and the installation of Flettner Rotors for the Gas Tankers. The company
   could save up to 17\% CO2 emissions and approximately 2 million dollars
   per year compared to the 2019 baseline by employing all recommended
   mitigation measures to all vessel categories. In addition, Carbon
   Storage and Capture could become a cost-effective solution with
   appropriate carbon taxation, but it is not the ultimate solution since
   it does not lead to independence from fossil fuels. The study also
   reveals that depending on the operating condition, even within the same
   vessel category, different mitigation measures should be employed.},

Title = {How to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in homes and

Booktitle = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2005},
Pages = {111-117},
Abstract = {The Earth's climate is changing; the expected changes pose a serious
   challenge to the built environment. This includes our cities, our rural
   and coastal settlements, our homes and businesses, our infrastructure
   and ultimately our health and safety. As a response, the New Zealand
   Government has signed the instrument of ratification to the Kyoto
   Protocol. Once in force, this will mean that in the first commitment
   period of 2008-12, New Zealanders will be subject to a number of
   domestic and international policy measures to reduce their greenhouse
   gas emissions.
   To assist homeowners and small- to medium-sized office owners/managers
   cope with these requirements, a booklet called the Easy Guide to Being a
   Climate-Friendly Kiwi was developed. The key objective was to encourage
   individuals to think about the connections between their actions and
   impacts on the climate, and to enable people to take action to reduce
   their energy-related greenhouse gases.
   Energy-related emissions were chosen, as energy use is the area in
   people's lives over which they have the most control. As well as
   providing a range of mitigation options, the guide provides a `carbon
   calculator' for readers to calculate how much CO2 they are responsible
   for. This paper discusses how this guide was developed and why the
   information included is an important issue for the building sector.},

Abstract = {Global climate change affects the temperature and precipitation. These

   rational measures for adaptation to climate change. The paper
   investigates the impact of climate change on water resources in Turkey
   at national level by collaborating the related literature, considering
   both the past observations and future predictions. Legal status of
   Turkey in terms of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions from Turkey,
   effects of climate change on temperature and precipitation in Turkey,
   effects of climate change on water resources potential, sea level rise
   and floods in Turkey, examples from different regions of the country and

Title = {Operationalising a resilience approach to adapting an urban delta to
   uncertain climate changes},

Abstract = {Climate change may pose considerable challenges to coastal cities,
   particularly in low-lying urban deltas. Impacts are, however, associated
   with substantial uncertainties. This paper studies an uncertainty-robust
   adaptation strategy: strengthening the resilience of the impacted
   system. This approach is operationalised for the city of Rotterdam,
   using literature study, interviews, and a workshop. Potential impacts
   have been explored using national climate statistics and scenarios and a
   set of `wildcards' (imaginable surprises). Sea level rise, particularly
   in combination with storm surge, and enduring heat and drought are the
   most relevant potential stresses in the area. These can lead to damage,
   loss of image, and societal disruption. Unclear responsibilities enhance
   disruption. `Resilience principles' nude the concept of resilience
   sufficiently operational for local actors to explore policy options.
   Useful principles for urban resilience include: homeostasis, omnivory,
   high flux, flatness, buffering, redundancy, foresight and
   preparedness/planning, compartmentalisation, and flexible
   planning/design. A resilience approach makes the system less prone to
   disturbances, enables quick and flexible responses, and is better
   capable of dealing with surprises than traditional predictive
   approaches. Local actors frame resilience as a flexible approach to
   adaptation that would be more suitable and tailored to local situations
   than rigid top-down regulations. In addition to a change in policy, it
   would require a more pro-active mentality among the population. (C) 2009

Title = {A big picture of urban heat island mitigation strategies and
   recommendation for India},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change poses a great threat to humans and the ecosystem of the
   planet. There are many factors that trigger climate change, and there
   are many aftereffects. One of the after-effects is Urban Heat Island
   (UHI), recognized as the most evident characteristic of urban climate
   which occurs due to dark, non-reflective surfaces. These surfaces absorb
   the warmth of the Sun, radiate heat; Thus, increase the land surface
   temperature. Additionally, heat islands increase cooling loads in the
   summer, which tends to increase energy consumption and produce more
   greenhouse gases. There are numerous strategies to mitigate the UHI
   effect. This study reviews various UHI mitigation strategies and their
   effectiveness in cooling the urban environment and propose a set of
   recommendation based on research and analysis. Broadly, the mitigation
   strategies have been divided into (i) Roof strategies, (ii) non-roof
   strategies, and (iii) covered parking strategies. It has been found out
   that the simultaneous use of several UHI mitigation measures has a more
   significant impact on lowering the urban temperature and could be
   mitigated. The study highlights the importance of each mitigation
   strategy and presents a set of recommendations for India that can be
   directed at the government level to policies to mitigate the UHI effect.},

Abstract = {Sea level has been steadily rising over the past century, predominantly
   due to anthropogenic climate change. The rate of sea level rise will
   keep increasing with continued global warming, and, even if temperatures
   are stabilized through the phasing out of greenhouse gas emissions, sea
   level is still expected to rise for centuries. This will affect coastal
   areas worldwide, and robust projections are needed to assess mitigation
   options and guide adaptation measures. Here we combine the equilibrium
   response of the main sea level rise contributions with their last
   century's observed contribution to constrain projections of future sea
   level rise. Our model is calibrated to a set of observations for each
   contribution, and the observational and climate uncertainties are
   combined to produce uncertainty ranges for 21st century sea level rise.
   We project anthropogenic sea level rise of 28-56 cm, 37-77 cm, and
   57-131 cm in 2100 for the greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP26,
   RCP45, and RCP85, respectively. Our uncertainty ranges for total sea
   level rise overlap with the process-based estimates of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The ``constrained
   extrapolation{''} approach generalizes earlier global semiempirical
   models and may therefore lead to a better understanding of the
   discrepancies with process-based projections.},

Title = {Mahuika-Auckland: A spatially and temporally resolved fossil fuel CO2
   emissions data product for Auckland, New Zealand},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL},
Abstract = {Accurate, high-resolution and sector-specific greenhouse gas emissions
   information is increasingly needed for the development of local,
   targeted mitigation policies. We describe a detailed, spatially and
   temporally resolved CO2 emissions data product, Mahuika-Auckland, for
   Auckland, New Zealand, based on Auckland's regional greenhouse gas and
   air emissions inventories. Emissions are provided at 500 m spatial
   resolution and at a 1-hr time step, a level of detail not previously
   available for any New Zealand city. We divide fossil fuel emissions into
   six sectors that comprise the majority of Auckland Region's CO2
   emissions profile: on-road transport, industrial non-point buildings and
   point sources, commercial non-point buildings, residential non-point
   buildings, air transport and sea transport. We also include separate
   layers representing biogenic CO2 emissions (primarily waste and wood
   burning), as these are significant sources in Auckland. We distribute
   emissions spatially and temporally based on activity data, energy and
   fuel consumption patterns, and population statistics. The code to
   generate Mahuika-Auckland has been designed to be flexible so that
   updated information and/or data from more recent years can easily be
   incorporated. This data product improves upon New Zealand's current
   inventories that are only resolved at the regional and annual scale,
   providing a new level of detail that can be used as a prior estimate for
   atmospheric inversions, to inform emissions reduction policies and to
   guide the development of zero carbon pathways.},

Abstract = {Considerable climate changes have been observed in the last 50 years -
   warming in every spatial scale (global, continental, regional and
   local), changes in atmospheric precipitation and several weather
   extremes, shrinking of cryosphere and sea level rise. The warming since
   the mid-20th century has predominantly been due to greenhouse gas
   emissions from human activities, in particular the combustion of fossil
   fuels, farming and other changes in land use. The paper presents the
   aspects of impact of climate change for farming and food security and
   the impact of farming for climate change in Polish and global scale.
   Agriculture holds a meaningful potential of reduction of greenhouse gas
   emissions and of carbon sequestration. It will be necessary to manage
   optimally advantageous changes and effectively adapt to adverse changes.},

Title = {The progressive routes for carbon capture and sequestration},
Journal = {ENERGY SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-122},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The global warming is directly related to the increased greenhouse gas
   emissions from both natural and anthropogenic origins. There has been a
   drastic rise in the concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases
   since the industrial revolution primarily due to the intensifying
   consumption of fossil fuels. With the need to reduce carbon emissions
   and mitigate global warming certain strategies relating to carbon
   capturing and sequestration are indispensable. This paper
   comprehensively describes several physicochemical, biological and
   geological routes for carbon capture and sequestration. The trend of the
   increase in greenhouse gases over the years is illustrated along with
   the global statistics for fossil fuels usage and biofuels production.
   The physicochemical carbon capturing technologies discussed include
   absorption, adsorption, membrane separation and cryogenic distillation.
   The algal and bacterial systems, dedicated energy crops and coalbed
   methanogenesis have been vividly explained as the biological routes for
   carbon sequestration. The geological carbon sequestering route centers
   on biochar application and oceanic carbon storage. A systematic survey
   has been made on the origin and impact of greenhouse gases along with
   the potential for sequestration based on some fast-track and long-term
   sequestration technologies.},

Title = {Climate convention implementation: An opportunity for the Pacific island
   nations to move toward sustainable energy systems},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {493-504},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {The impacts of global warming are among the more serious environmental
   threats far the Pacific Island countries. These nations justifiably
   argue that developed countries should give immediate priority to the
   implementation of climate change mitigation policies because of the
   severe nature of potential greenhouse impacts for the Pacific Islands.
   Another immediate priority acknowledged by these nations is the need for
   development of adaptation policies that plan for adjustment or
   adaptation, where possible, to the foreshadowed impacts of climate
   change.
   This article does not focus on adaptation or mitigation policy directly
   but on an allied opportunity that exists for the Pacific Islands via the
   auspices of the Climate Convention, because the existing very costly
   energy systems used in the Pacific island region are fossil-fuel
   dependent. It is argued here that efforts can be made towards the
   development of energy systems that are ecologically sustainable because
   Pacific Island nations are eligible to receive assistance to introduce
   renewable energy technology and pursue energy conservation via
   implementation mechanisms of the Climate Convention and, in particular
   through transfer of technology and via joint implementation.
   II is contended that assistance in the form of finance, technology, and
   human resource development from developed countries and international
   organizations would provide sustainable benefits in improving the local
   Pacific island environments. It is also emphasized that mitigation of
   greenhouse gas emissions is not the responsibility of the Pacific
   Islands as they contribute very little on a per capita global scale and
   a tiny proportion of total global greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Global Warming and Dairy Cattle: How to Control and Reduce Methane
   Emission},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Concerns about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
   livestock and dairy farms, as well as their connection to global warming
   and climate change, have grown among the general public worldwide in
   recent years. To evaluate these emissions, there is a need to use
   reliable methods. Enteric methane (CH4) and other greenhouse gas
   emissions from ruminants can be mitigated in numerous ways. The
   objectives of this review were to examine currently available knowledge
   about methane evaluation and mitigation strategies, and food
   supplements. We wanted to present a critical view and raise visions of
   what is known and unknown about GHG reduction and control. Agriculture
   produces greenhouse gases. Methane is a result of manure degradation and
   microbial fermentation in the rumen. Reduced CH4 emissions will slow
   climate change and reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. This review
   compiled studies to evaluate the best ways to decrease methane
   emissions. Longer rumination times reduce methane emissions and milk
   methane. Other studies have not found this. Increasing propionate and
   reducing acetate and butyrate in the rumen can reduce hydrogen
   equivalents that would otherwise be transferred to methanogenesis. Diet
   can reduce methane emissions. Grain lowers rumen pH, increases
   propionate production, and decreases CH4 yield. Methane generation per
   unit of energy-corrected milk yield reduces with a higher-energy diet.
   Bioactive bromoform discovered in the red seaweed Asparagopsis
   taxiformis reduces livestock intestinal methane output by inhibiting its
   production. Essential oils, tannins, saponins, and flavonoids are
   anti-methanogenic. While it is true that plant extracts can assist in
   reducing methane emissions, it is crucial to remember to source and
   produce plants in a sustainable manner. Minimal lipid supplementation
   can reduce methane output by 20\%, increasing energy density and animal
   productivity. Selecting low- CH4 cows may lower GHG emissions. These
   findings can lead to additional research to completely understand the
   impacts of methanogenesis suppression on rumen fermentation and
   post-absorptive metabolism, which could improve animal productivity and
   efficiency.},

   Implications for the Caribbean tourism industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-205},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Nations with tourism dependant economies are becoming increasingly
   concerned about the inclusion of aviation in greenhouse gas mitigation
   policy for international bunker fuels and more recently adaptation
   policy proposals. The central concern is that such policies will
   increase the cost of traveling by air, therefore reducing visitor
   arrivals to long-haul, tourism-dependent destinations, often small
   island developing states. This study used a tourism arrivals model to
   examine the implications of currently proposed climate policies for the
   world's most tourism dependant region - the Caribbean. Results indicate
   that under current proposals for both mitigation and adaptation focused
   climate policy, reductions in tourist arrivals from the major markets of
   Europe and North America would be negligible versus business as usual
   growth projections Only under the most stringent mitigation policy
   scenario. Which may portend a post-2020 policy regime, is a significant
   decrease in tourist arrivals predicted. Of the climate policies
   assessed, the adaptation policy had the potential to provide greater
   economic benefits to the Caribbean region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Surf Life Saving Australia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {75-79},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The coastal zone of Australia is likely to experience significant
   impacts as a result of climate change in the course of this century,
   even if the efforts expected from the international community to
   stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations eventuate.
   Importantly, without future reductions in the emissions of greenhouse
   gases, impacts will increase. The impacts of climate change may include
   a heightening of weather event intensity and sea level rise, which in
   combination could have far reaching effects for coastal recreation,
   beach safety service provision and surf life saving facilities and
   services. In this respect, the potential impacts of climate change
   represent a significant challenge for Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA).
   Recognising the importance of this issue, SLSA undertook to develop a
   plan for adaptive action. This paper presents the outcomes of the
   resultant Climate Change Adaptation Road Map for SLSA. The Road Map
   represents an important for step for SLSA in their adaptive journey. (C)

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {85-89},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As president of the Climate Change Conference of the Parties, Chile has
   advocated for developing ambitious commitments to mitigate greenhouse
   gas emissions to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. However, Chile's
   motivations and ambitious push to reach carbon-neutrality are
   complicated by a backdrop of severe drought, climate change impacts
   (i.e., wildfires, tree mortality), and the use of industrial plantations
   as a mitigation strategy. This has become more evident as widespread and
   severe wildfires have impacted large areas of industrial plantations,
   transforming the land-use, land-use change, and forestry sector from a
   carbon sink to a net carbon source. Consequently, Chile must diversify
   its climate actions to achieve carbon-neutrality. Nature-based
   solutions, including wetlands-peatlands and oceans, represent
   alternative climate actions that can be implemented to tackle greenhouse
   gas emissions at a national level. Diversification, however, must
   guarantee Chile's long-term carbon sequestration capacity without
   compromising the ecological functionality of biodiverse treeless
   habitats and native forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Assessing the robustness of adaptation decisions to climate change
   uncertainties: A case study on water resources management in the East of
   England},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {17},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Projections of future climate change are plagued with uncertainties,
   causing difficulties for planners taking decisions on adaptation
   measures. This paper presents an assessment framework that allows the
   identification of adaptation strategies that are robust (i.e.
   insensitive) to climate change uncertainties. The framework is applied
   to a case study of water resources management in the East of England,
   more specifically to the Anglian Water Services' 25 year Water Resource
   Plan (WRP). The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis (a
   `one-at-a-time' experiment) of the various elements of the modelling
   framework (e.g., emissions of greenhouse gases, climate sensitivity and
   global climate models) in order to determine whether or not a decision
   to adapt to climate change is sensitive to uncertainty in those
   elements.
   Water resources are found to be sensitive to uncertainties in regional
   climate response (from general circulation models and dynamical
   downscaling), in climate sensitivity and in climate impacts. Aerosol
   forcing and greenhouse gas emissions uncertainties are also important,
   whereas uncertainties from ocean mixing and the carbon cycle are not.
   Despite these large uncertainties, Anglian Water Services' WRP remains
   robust to the climate change uncertainties sampled because of the
   adaptation options being considered (e.g. extension of water treatment
   works), because the climate model used for their planning (HadCM3)
   predicts drier conditions than other models, and because `one-at-a-time'
   experiments do not sample the combination of different extremes in the
   uncertainty range of parameters. This research raises the question of
   how much certainty is required in climate change projections to justify
   investment in adaptation measures, and whether such certainty can be
   delivered. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Probabilistic cost estimates for climate change mitigation},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {493},
Number = {7430},
Pages = {79-83},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {For more than a decade, the target of keeping global warming below 2
   degrees C has been a key focus of the international climate debate(1).
   In response, the scientific community has published a number of scenario
   studies that estimate the costs of achieving such a target(2-5).
   Producing these estimates remains a challenge, particularly because of
   relatively well known, but poorly quantified, uncertainties, and owing
   to limited integration of scientific knowledge across disciplines(6).
   The integrated assessment community, on the one hand, has extensively
   assessed the influence of technological and socio-economic uncertainties
   on low-carbon scenarios and associated costs(2-4,7). The climate
   modelling community, on the other hand, has spent years improving its
   understanding of the geophysical response of the Earth system to
   emissions of greenhouse gases(8-12). This geophysical response remains a
   key uncertainty in the cost of mitigation scenarios but has been
   integrated with assessments of other uncertainties in only a rudimentary
   manner, that is, for equilibrium conditions(6,13). Here we bridge this
   gap between the two research communities by generating distributions of
   the costs associated with limiting transient global temperature increase
   to below specific values, taking into account uncertainties in four
   factors: geophysical, technological, social and political. Wefind that
   political choices that delay mitigation have the largest effect on the
   cost-risk distribution, followed by geophysical uncertainties, social
   factors influencing future energy demand and, lastly, technological
   uncertainties surrounding the availability of greenhouse gas mitigation
   options. Our information on temperature risk and mitigation costs
   provides crucial information for policy-making, because it clarifies the
   relative importance of mitigation costs, energy demand and the timing of
   global action in reducing the risk of exceeding a global temperature
   increase of 2 degrees C, or other limits such as 3 degrees C or 1.5
   degrees C, across a wide range of scenarios.},

Abstract = {Climate changes exert negative impacts on the global environments and
   the human beings. They imply more frequent extreme weather events, which
   are responsible of sea level rise, coastal erosion, flooding, droughts,
   and desertification. Mitigation and adaptation represent intertwined
   strategies for counteracting climate changes. Mitigation is associated
   to the lessening of the causes of climate changes and includes actions
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation is a proactive concept
   addressing how humans can adapt and benefit from climate change. The
   mainstreaming and integration of adaptation to climate change into
   routine practice can be favored by Strategic Environmental Assessment
   (SEA) of regional policies, plans and programmes. In this study, we aim
   at scrutinizing a set of SEA reports of regional plans and programmes
   adopted in Sardinia (Italy), to investigate if -and to what extent-
   adaptation to climate change has characterized planning and programming
   tools. Evidence shows that the integration of adaptation-driven issues
   into regional planning is still in its infancy but presents the signs of
   promising expansion.},

Abstract = {Projected anthropogenic warming and increases in CO2 concentration
   present a twofold threat, both from climate changes and from CO2
   directly through increasing the acidity of the oceans. Future climate
   change may be reduced through mitigation ( reductions in greenhouse gas
   emissions) or through geoengineering. Most geoengineering approaches,
   however, do not address the problem of increasing ocean acidity. A
   combined mitigation/ geoengineering strategy could remove this
   deficiency. Here we consider the deliberate injection of sulfate aerosol
   precursors into the stratosphere. This action could substantially offset
   future warming and provide additional time to reduce human dependence on
   fossil fuels and stabilize CO2 concentrations cost-effectively at an
   acceptable level.},

Title = {Impacts of surface water interchange between urban rivers and fish ponds
   in Chu river of Nanjing, China: A potential cause of greenhouse gas
   emissions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Surface water interchange between aquaculture ponds and urban rivers is
   commonly used for the abatement of water pollution and regulating
   ecological services. Although, underlying impact of surface water
   interchange for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is yet to be explored. In
   this study, sediment microcosm incubation and field observation has been
   employed to understand the impact of surface water interchange on GHG
   potential over aquaculture ponds and urban rivers, and further
   characterize their underlying mechanism. Results showed that Fish
   pond(interchange) (P-int) and Chu River riparian (CRR) exhibit a similar
   variation pattern of GHG emission rate. Consequently, annual
   accumulative emissions of methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide of
   CRR were 0.89, 2.1, and 20.83 folds than that of P-int, respectively.
   For the incubation experiment, primarily it was assessed that
   fish-pond-overlying water treatments had larger accumulative GHG
   emissions than deionized water treatments, which is in agreement with
   the field observation. Secondly, the process of surface water
   interchange altered the concentrations of nutrients in benthic sediment
   from both sites of CRR and P-int, thereby increased the GHG accumulative
   in the CRR and showing reciprocate results in case of P-int. This study
   could be helpful to reduce the potential GHG emissions from urban
   freshwater bodies in the future by adopting strategic mitigation
   measures like catchment area treatment plans in the vicinity of urban
   river catchment.},

Title = {Salt marsh climate change adaptation: Using runnels to adapt to
   accelerating sea level rise within a drowning New England salt marsh},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sea level rise within New England is accelerating at a rate faster than
   the global average, leaving salt marshes particularly susceptible to
   degradation. Hydrological alteration is a type of climate change
   adaptation technique that can be used to combat the effects of sea level
   rise within salt marshes. Runnels (shallow channels) are a type of
   climate adaptation strategy used to enhance drainage in drowning
   marshes. In this study, we investigated the impacts of runnel
   installations, 3-5 years post-implementation, on soil properties,
   vegetation composition, and greenhouse gas fluxes. We studied two runnel
   treatments (Low Elevation Runnel and High Elevation Runnel) and found
   that in the Low Elevation Runnel areas Spartina alterniflora stem
   density significantly increased in the three growing seasons after
   runnels were installed, and the high marsh plant, Spartina patens,
   persisted in the High Elevation Runnel areas. There was a significant
   difference in carbon dioxide uptake rates among treatments, with the
   unmanipulated (Reference) areas having the highest uptake rates and an
   increase in CO2 uptake over time seen in the Low Elevation Runnel
   treatment. These findings highlight the potential use of a climate
   change adaptation strategy to combat sea level rise impacts and provide
   insights for future adaptation efforts.},

Abstract = {The planet's mean air and ocean temperatures have been rising over the
   last century because of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These
   changes have substantial effects on the epidemiology of infectious
   diseases. We describe direct and indirect processes linking climate
   change and infectious diseases in livestock with reference to specific
   case studies. Some of the studies are used to show a positive
   association between temperature and expansion of the geographical ranges
   of arthropod vectors (e.g. Culicoides imicola, which transmits
   bluetongue virus) while others are used to illustrate an opposite trend
   (e.g. tsetse flies that transmit a range of trypanosome parasites in
   sub-Saharan Africa). We further describe a positive association between
   extreme events: droughts and El Niflo/southern oscillation (ENSO)
   weather patterns and Rift Valley fever outbreaks in East Africa and some
   adaptation practices used to mitigate the impacts of climate change that
   may increase risk of exposure to infectious pathogens. We conclude by
   outlining mitigation and adaptation measures that can be used
   specifically in the livestock sector to minimize the impacts of climate
   change-associated livestock diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Dimensions of Blue Carbon and emerging perspectives},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Blue Carbon is a term coined in 2009 to draw attention to the
   degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems and the need to conserve
   and restore them to mitigate climate change and for the other ecosystem
   services they provide. Blue Carbon has multiple meanings, which we aim
   to clarify here, which reflect the original descriptions of the concept
   including (1) all organic matter captured by marine organisms, and (2)
   how marine ecosystems could be managed to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation and
   conservation. The multifaceted nature of the Blue Carbon concept has led
   to unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, where scientists,
   conservationists and policy makers have interacted intensely to advance
   shared goals. Some coastal ecosystems (mangroves, tidal marshes and
   seagrass) are established Blue Carbon ecosystems as they often have high
   carbon stocks, support long-term carbon storage, offer the potential to
   manage greenhouse gas emissions and support other adaptation policies.
   Some marine ecosystems do not meet key criteria for inclusion within the
   Blue Carbon framework (e.g. fish, bivalves and coral reefs). Others have
   gaps in scientific understanding of carbon stocks or greenhouse gas
   fluxes, or currently there is limited potential for management or
   accounting for carbon sequestration (macroalgae and phytoplankton), but
   may be considered Blue Carbon ecosystems in the future, once these gaps
   are addressed.},

Abstract = {When climate change mitigation strategies are discussed in reports such
   as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published in 2001 (Metz
   et al., 2001), the authors inevitably center on reduction of emissions
   of greenhouse gases and, to a lesser extent, reduction in aerosol
   emissions such as black carbon aerosols. Reductions of carbon emissions
   to the atmosphere includes strategies to not only capture and store
   carbon emissions from, for example, coal fired power plants, but also
   includes strategies such as increasing energy efficiency, greater use of
   renewable energy sources, and greater use of fuels that do not contain
   carbon (such as nuclear) or are carbon-neutral. Over the next several
   centuries most or all of the earth's fossil fuel reserves (about 4000
   Gt-C) may be consumed, with the hope that carbon capture and storage
   (CCS) will minimize future greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are
   not dangerous to the planet. However, as discussed in this paper, it may
   not be possible for repositories to reliably store the massive amounts
   of carbon generated without imposing environmental risks. Further, while
   control of global warming is of immediate concern, possibilities of
   other types of climate change exist. Abrupt changes could be triggered
   that, for example, might reduce the deep North Atlantic circulation and
   produce a cooling over much of the earth. Second, the earth has been in
   an interglacial warm period for over 10,000 years, and if the climate
   cycles observed in the previous 500,000 years continue, it is possible
   that the earth will return to a colder period. Ultimately, control of
   global cooling may be a more challenging problem than control of global
   warming.
   If reduction of greenhouse gas emissions turns out not to be the
   complete solution to climate change mitigation requirements (which may
   involve both warming and cooling periods), what is? In this paper,
   earth-based and space-based techniques are explored that are designed to
   supplement greenhouse gas reduction approaches. While the strategies
   presented here may be futuristic and expensive, they do provide us with
   an outlook on controlling global climate change that may spawn ideas for
   other mitigation techniques. General design considerations are presented
   based on a global energy balance model to predict global temperature
   changes not only in response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations,
   but also to changing conditions in the earth system, such as the net
   incoming solar radiation or the planetary albedo. The approaches are
   intended to perturb the earth's energy balance in a controllable manner.
   Today, for example, data show that the earth is not in an equilibrium
   energy state. About 1.0 W/m(2) more energy is coming into the earth than
   is leaving, indicating that the earth is `' committed `' to this amount
   of global warming and its attendant consequences, even if greenhouse gas
   concentrations in the atmosphere do not continue to increase. This
   energy imbalance is equivalent to a further warming of 0.5 degrees C to
   1 degrees C, comparable to the observed global warming that has occurred
   over the past century. One benefit of the supplemental mitigation
   techniques would be to help `' uncommit `' earth from such energy
   imbalances, as well as to provide a basis for addressing future climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs in the tropical Pacific region are exposed to a range of
   anthropogenic local pressures. Climate change is exacerbating local
   impacts, causing unprecedented declines in coral reef habitats and
   bringing negative socioeconomic consequences to Pacific communities who
   depend heavily on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods.
   Continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions will drive future
   climate change, which will accelerate coral reef degradation.
   Traditional systems of resource governance in Pacific island nations
   provide a foundation to address local pressures and build reef
   resilience to climate change. Management and adaptation options should
   build on the regional diversity of governance systems and traditional
   knowledge to support community-based initiatives and cross-sectoral
   cooperation to address local pressures and minimize climate change
   impacts. Such an inclusive approach will offer enhanced opportunities to
   develop and implement transformative adaptation solutions, particularly
   in remote and regional areas where centralized management does not
   extend.},

   leakage detection, monitoring and mitigation strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {100},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Hydrocarbon gas emissions from with decommissioned wells are an
   underreported source of greenhouse gas emissions in oil and gas
   provinces. The associated emissions may partly counteract efforts to
   mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure. We
   have developed an approach for assessing methane leakage from marine
   decommissioned wells based on a combination of existing regional
   industrial seismic and newly acquired hydroacoustic water column imaging
   data from the Central North Sea. Here, we present hydroacoustic data
   which show that 28 out of 43 investigated wells release gas from the
   seafloor into the water column. This gas release largely depends on the
   presence of shallow gas accumulations and their distance to the wells.
   The released gas is likely primarily biogenic methane from shallow
   sources. In the upper 1,000m below the seabed, gas migration is likely
   focused along drilling-induced fractures around the borehole or through
   non-sealing barriers. Combining available direct measurements for
   methane release from marine decommissioned wells with our leakage
   analysis suggests that gas release from investigated decommissioned
   hydrocarbon wells is a major source of methane in the North Sea (0.9-3.7
   {[}95\% confidence interval = 0.7-4.2] kt yr(-1) of CH4 for 1,792 wells
   in the UK sector of the Central North Sea). This means hydrocarbon gas
   emissions associated with marine hydrocarbon wells are not significant
   for the global greenhouse gas budget, but have to be considered when
   compiling regional methane budgets.},

Abstract = {Emissions from motor vehicles, power plants, deforestation, and other
   human sources are warming the Earth and damaging ecosystems and human
   well-being. Field observations from around the world have detected
   significant changes in terrestrial ecosystems and attributed them to
   climate change rather than other factors. Climate change has shifted the
   ranges of plants, animals, and biomes, altered the timing of life events
   such as plant flowering and animal migration, increased wildfires, and
   driven 75 frog and other amphibian species to extinction. Projections of
   future climate change and analyses of vulnerability indicate that unless
   we substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, further warming may
   overwhelm the adaptive capacity of many species and ecosystems. Climate
   change could convert extensive land areas from one biome to another,
   alter global biogeochemical cycles, and isolate or drive numerous
   species to extinction. Natural resource managers are developing
   adaptation measures to help species and ecosystems cope with the impacts
   of climate change.},

Abstract = {The international scientific community has indicated that anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas emissions are likely the main cause of rising
   temperatures since the mid-twentieth century. Cities have not only been
   a major contributor to these emissions but are also in locations that
   will experience the impacts most intensely. Accounting for more than
   half of the world's population, most built assets and economic activity
   is concentrated in cities - factors that make these environments highly
   vulnerable to climate change. The impacts caused by climate change are
   already being felt in urban centers and have been increasing in recent
   years. The main problems involving climate change for cities are rising
   temperatures, rising sea levels, heat islands, floods, and extreme
   events. Most Brazilian cities already have environmental problems
   associated with development patterns and transformation of geographical
   areas. Exacerbated changes in the hydrological cycle by reason of global
   warming tend to accentuate the existing risks such as floods,
   landslides, heat waves, and limitations on the supply of potable water.
   This article presents a case study of Rio de Janeiro city on how the
   city is acting to confront climate change through adaptation strategies.},

   forcing and surface temperature change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding the relative contributions of individual countries to
   global climate change for different time periods is essential for
   mitigation strategies that seek to hold nations accountable for their
   historical emissions. Previous assessments of this kind have compared
   countries by their greenhouse gas emissions, but have yet to consider
   the full spectrum of the short-lived gases and aerosols. In this study,
   we use the radiative forcing of anthropogenic emissions of long-lived
   greenhouse gases, ozone precursors, aerosols, and from albedo changes
   from land cover change together with a simple climate model to evaluate
   country contributions to climate change. We assess the historical
   contribution of each country to global surface temperature change from
   anthropogenic forcing (Delta T-s), future Delta T-s through year 2100
   given two different emissions scenarios, and the Delta T-s that each
   country has committed to from past activities between 1850 and 2010
   (committed Delta T-s). By including forcings in addition to the
   long-lived greenhouse gases the contribution of developed countries,
   particularly the United States, to Delta T-s from 1850 to 2010 (58\%) is
   increased compared to an assessment of CO2-equivalent emissions for the
   same time period (52\%). Contributions to committed Delta T-s evaluated
   at year 2100, dominated by long-lived greenhouse gas forcing, are more
   evenly split between developed and developing countries (55\% and 45\%,
   respectively). The portion of anthropogenic Delta T-s attributable to
   developing countries is increasing, led by emissions from China and
   India, and we estimate that this will surpass the contribution from
   developed countries around year 2030.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change on Earth already exist in different forms
   - as an increase in global average temperatures, as a sea level rise or
   as extreme weather events, and it is necessary to take significant
   measures to mitigate and adapt to the climate change. One of the tools
   that can help in attempts to mitigate climate change is the use of
   carbon footprint concept, as a measure of the greenhouse gas emissions.
   Since there are different approaches, it is necessary and possible to
   establish a harmonised approach for calculating the organisations'
   carbon footprint, in order to obtain comparable results and benchmarks
   for different kinds of organisations. The Croatian version of the Bilan
   Carbone model, fully in accordance with appropriate international
   standards, with country-specific emission factors database, was tested
   on the case of the Energy Institute Hrvoje Pozar for the period
   2015-2017. The carbon footprint for 2017 was 650.6 tonnes or 7.31 tonnes
   per employee of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, with dominant
   shares of people transport (59\%) and energy sources (22\%). This
   harmonised approach for carbon footprint calculation will lead to
   comparable results for the same kinds or groups of organisations and
   therewith, lighten the process of establishing the carbon footprint
   mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Climate change refers to the long-term changes in temperature and
   weather due to human activities. Increase in average global temperature
   and extreme and unpredictable weather are the most common manifestations
   of climate change. In recent years, it has acquired the importance of
   global emergency and affecting not only the wellbeing of humans but also
   the sustainability of other lifeforms. Enormous increase in the emission
   of greenhouse gases (CO2, methane and nitrous oxide) in recent decades
   largely due to burning of coal and fossil fuels, and deforestation are
   the main drivers of climate change. Marked increase in the frequency and
   intensity of natural disasters, rise in sea level, decrease in crop
   productivity and loss of biodiversity are the main consequences of
   climate change. Obvious mitigation measures include significant
   reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and increase in the forest
   cover of the landmass. Conference of Parties (COP 21), held in Paris in
   2015 adapted, as a legally binding treaty, to limit global warming to
   well below 2 degrees C, preferably to 1.5 degrees C by 2100, compared to
   pre-industrial levels. However, under the present emission scenario, the
   world is heading for a 3-4 degrees C warming by the end of the century.
   This was discussed further in COP 26 held in Glasgow in November 2021;
   many countries pledged to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050 and to
   end deforestation, essential requirements to keep 1.5 degrees C target.
   However, even with implementation of these pledges, the rise is expected
   to be around 2.4 degrees C. Additional measures are urgently needed to
   realize the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C and to
   sustain biodiversity and human welfare.},

Abstract = {Carbon capture from point source emissions has been recognized as one of
   several strategies necessary for mitigating unfettered release of
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. To keep GHGs at manageable
   levels, large decreases in CO2 emissions through capturing and
   separation will be required. This article reviews the possible CO2
   capture and separation technologies for end-of-pipe applications. The
   three main CO2 capture technologies discussed include post-combustion,
   pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion techniques. Various separation
   techniques, such as chemical absorption, physical absorption, physical
   adsorption, cryogenics, membrane technology, membranes in conjunction
   with chemical absorption and chemical-looping combustion (CLC) are also
   thoroughly discussed. Future directions are suggested for application by
   oil and gas industry. Sequestration methods, such as geological, mineral
   carbonation techniques, and ocean dump are not covered in this review.

   scope 1, 2, and 3 activities were determined as 14,148,597 tCO(2)e for
   2016. Industrial fuel consumption, transportation, and residential
   heating activities were the main sources. GHG emission control sectors
   were determined according to the last consecutive workshops in 2017.
   Control actions, such as Energy efficiency/renewable energy applications
   in residential and commercial buildings, increasing the share of public
   transport in transportation, and reducing the number of private vehicles
   in traffic, were planned. Future projections for 2030 were estimated
   with and without reduction activities. Sectors (industry, agriculture,
   and animal husbandry) which are not within the jurisdiction of local
   governments or which cannot be intervened by local governments were
   excluded. It showed that with the mitigation measures to be implemented.
   Public transport problems, renewable energy conversion, and reduction of

Title = {Assessing terrestrial biogeochemical feedbacks in a strategically
   geoengineered climate},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Geoengineering by injecting sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the lower
   stratosphere has been suggested to reduce anthropogenically induced
   warming. While impacts of such geoengineering on climate have been
   investigated in recent decades, few modeling studies have considered
   biogeochemical feedbacks resulting from such intervention. This study
   comprehensively characterizes responses and feedbacks of terrestrial
   ecosystems, from an ensemble of coupled high-resolution Earth system
   model climate change simulations, under the highest standard greenhouse
   gas scenario with an extreme geoengineering mitigation strategy. Under
   this strategy, temperature increases beyond 2020 levels due to elevated
   anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) were completely offset by the
   SO(2)injection. Carbon cycle feedbacks can alter the trajectory of
   atmospheric CO(2)levels by storing or releasing additional carbon on
   land and in the ocean, thus moderating or amplifying climate change. We
   assess terrestrial biogeochemical feedbacks to climate in response to
   geoengineering, using model output from the Stratospheric Aerosol
   Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS) project. Results indicate
   terrestrial ecosystems become a stronger carbon sink globally because of
   lower ecosystem respiration and diminished disturbance effects under
   geoengineering. An additional 79 Pg C would be stored on land by the end
   of the twenty-first century, yielding as much as a 4\% reduction in
   atmospheric CO(2)mole fraction without marine biogeochemical feedbacks,
   compared to the high greenhouse gas scenario without geoengineering.},

Title = {How are coastal households responding to climate change?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {177-186},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In Australia, shared responsibility is a concept advocated to promote
   collective climate change adaptation by multiple actors and
   institutions. However, a shared response is often promoted in the
   absence of information regarding actions currently taken; in particular,
   there is limited knowledge regarding action occurring at the household
   scale. To address this gap, we examine household actions taken to
   address climate change and associated hazards in two Australian coastal
   communities. Mixed methods research is conducted to answer three
   questions: (1) what actions are currently taken (mitigation, actions to
   lobby for change or adaptation to climate impacts)? (2) why are these
   actions taken (e.g. are they consistent with capacity, experience,
   perceptions of risk); and (3) what are the implications for adaptation?
   We find that households are predominantly mitigating greenhouse gas
   emissions and that impact orientated adaptive actions are limited.
   Coping strategies are considered sufficient to mange climate risks,
   proving a disincentive for additional adaptive action. Influencing
   factors differ, but generally, risk perception and climate change belief
   are associated with action. However, the likelihood of more action is a
   function of homeownership and a tendency to plan ahead. Addressing
   factors that support or constrain household adaptive decision-making and
   action, from the physical (e.g. homeownership) to.the social (e.g.
   skills in planning and a culture of adapting to change) will be critical
   in increasing household participation in adaptation. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {COP-3 established that nations would act together to combat climate
   change. Nevertheless, Kyoto was probably just the first step in a long
   process of addressing this problem. If one accepts the scenarios of
   IPCC, deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will be needed if the
   world is to avoid major change in its climate. Most, but not all, of
   these emissions arise from use of energy, a commodity which is vital to
   modern society. To achieve reductions in emissions without affecting
   standards of living, will require extensive use of new and improved
   technology, by improvement in energy efficiency, change of fuels,
   introduction of new energy sources and abatement / sequestration of
   greenhouse gases. Some of these technologies are widely available now;
   others are in their infancy. In some cases, despite environmental
   benefit, the motivation for commercial development or deployment may be
   slight, since the technology will offer little or no competitive
   advantage to the user. Also, in the early days of a new energy
   technology, there may be few opportunities for full-scale investigation,
   so best use must be made of those which do occur. Many of these
   constraints on development may apply to the technology for capture and
   sequestration of CO2 in its current state of development. Such
   characteristics also make a good case for co-operative action, to
   improve understanding of the technology options. In view of the nature
   of the problem, it is especially appropriate that such action be
   international.
   The IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme is an international collaborative
   activity currently supported by 15 countries, the European Commission
   and 6 industrial sponsors. This Programme evaluates technologies for
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, disseminates
   information and promotes appropriate research, development and
   demonstration.
   The IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme has been in operation for 7 years
   and, in this paper, an overview will be provided of progress in the past
   3 years. This has extended previous work on technologies for generation
   and capture of CO2 from flue gases. Sequestration of CO2 has figured
   largely in this work, including a series of expert workshops on ocean
   storage of CO2, an assessment of large-scale sequestration using
   forestry and formation of practical research projects on geological
   storage. Studies on methods of producing and using hydrogen from fossil
   fuels without release of CO2 have demonstrated ways to ease the
   introduction of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Another important theme
   has been to put the option of CO2 capture and sequestration in context
   with other large-scale abatement/mitigation options, such as use of
   bio-mass for power generation. In addition, a series of studies on
   abatement of methane emissions from anthropogenic sources has recently
   been completed.
   These studies have identified a variety of abatement options, ranging
   from near-term opportunities which are cost-effective today through to
   long-term options which might have major impact but would require
   substantial research and development. Some results from the IEA
   Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme will be illustrated here. Other papers
   presented at the 4(th) International Conference on Greenhouse Gas
   control Technologies will provide further information.},

Abstract = {According to the Buildings Energy Data Book published by the U.S.
   Department of Energy, in 2006 the building sector consumed 38.9\% of the
   total primary energy used in the United States. Of this energy, 34.8\%
   is used by buildings for space heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning. This energy often involves the combustion of fossil fuels,
   contributing to carbon dioxide emissions and climate change. Even if
   greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere, extreme
   climate events and sea level rise will continue for several centuries
   due to inertia of the atmosphere. Therefore, adaptation will be a
   necessary compliment to carbon dioxide mitigation efforts. This paper
   argues that both mitigation of greenhouse gases and adaptation to
   climate change should be added to our building codes and stan- dards.
   Since space heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning utilize a large
   amount of energy in buildings, we should begin by redefining our thermal
   comfort standards and add strategies that mitigate carbon dioxide
   emissions and adapt to predicted climate variability. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {It is now accepted that tourism is a significant contributor to global
   climate change, especially through air travel's high greenhouse gas

   overcoming those dilemmas by adapting carbon neutral tourism policies.
   It researches the implementation issues facing carbon neutral tourism
   policies on the Seychelles Islands: tourism to the islands is
   energy-intensive, and current plans to increase tourist numbers will
   entail growing emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper analyses
   tourism's current levels of energy use and emissions, and explores ways
   to reduce them. Based on a survey of tourists and industry
   representatives in the Seychelles, it discusses options for
   tourism-dependent small island developing states to implement and

Title = {Future Arctic climate changes: Adaptation and mitigation time scales},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {68-74},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The climate in the Arctic is changing faster than in midlatitudes. This
   is shown by increased temperatures, loss of summer sea ice, earlier snow
   melt, impacts on ecosystems, and increased economic access. Arctic sea
   ice volume has decreased by 75\% since the 1980s. Long-lasting global
   anthropogenic forcing from carbon dioxide has increased over the
   previous decades and is anticipated to increase over the next decades.
   Temperature increases in response to greenhouse gases are amplified in
   the Arctic through feedback processes associated with shifts in albedo,
   ocean and land heat storage, and near-surface longwave radiation fluxes.
   Thus, for the next few decades out to 2040, continuing environmental
   changes in the Arctic are very likely, and the appropriate response is
   to plan for adaptation to these changes. For example, it is very likely
   that the Arctic Ocean will become seasonally nearly sea ice free before
   2050 and possibly within a decade or two, which in turn will further
   increase Arctic temperatures, economic access, and ecological shifts.
   Mitigation becomes an important option to reduce potential Arctic
   impacts in the second half of the 21st century. Using the most recent
   set of climate model projections (CMIP5), multimodel mean temperature
   projections show an Arctic-wide end of century increase of +13 degrees C
   in late fall and +5 degrees C in late spring for a business-as-usual
   emission scenario (RCP8.5) in contrast to +7 degrees C in late fall and
   +3 degrees C in late spring if civilization follows a mitigation
   scenario (RCP4.5). Such temperature increases demonstrate the heightened
   sensitivity of the Arctic to greenhouse gas forcing.},

Abstract = {Global climate change is increasing the frequency of heat waves, hot
   weather, and temperature variability, which contribute to mortality and
   illness. Baseline information on local efforts to reduce heat
   vulnerability, including public advisories; minimizing greenhouse gas
   emissions; and mitigating urban heat islands, is lacking.
   We designed a survey about local government programs to prevent health
   problems and reduce heat exposure during heatwaves and administered it
   to 285 US communities.
   Of 70 respondents, 26 indicated that excessive heat events are a
   significant issue for the local government; 30 had established
   preventive programs. Local government leadership and public health
   impacts of heat were cited most frequently as extremely important
   determinants of preventive programs, followed by implementation costs,
   economic impacts of hot weather, and greenhouse gas emissions
   mitigation. Cool paving materials and vegetated roofs were common heat
   mitigation strategies. Fact sheets and case studies were desired
   guidance for protecting communities during hot weather.
   New partnerships and financial resources are needed to support more
   widespread local action to prevent adverse health consequences of
   climate change and promote environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem management frequently aims to manage resilience yet measuring
   resilience has proven difficult. Here, we quantify the ecological
   resilience of the largest reef in the Caribbean and map potential
   benefits of marine reserves under two scenarios of greenhouse gas
   emissions. Resilience is calculated using spatial ecological models and
   defined as the probability of a reef remaining in its coral-dominated
   basin of attraction such that it does not flip into an alternate,
   algal-dominated attractor. In practice, resilience is the probability
   that coral populations will maintain the ability to exhibit a recovery
   trend after acute disturbances such as hurricanes. The inputs required
   to estimate resilience are a reef's initial state, physical environment,
   and disturbance regime. One major driver of reef resilience is herbivory
   by parrotfish and recent action to protect parrotfish in Belize was
   found to have increased resilience 6-fold. However, the expected
   benefits of parrotfish protection to future coral cover were relatively
   modest with only a 2- to 2.6-fold improvement over a business-as-usual
   scenario, demonstrating how resilience and ecosystem states are
   decoupled. Global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had little
   impact on average coral state unless it was accompanied by local
   controls of fishing. However, combined global and local action reduced
   the rate of reef degradation threefold. Operationalizing resilience
   explicitly integrates available biophysical data and accommodates the
   complex interactions among ecological processes and multiple types of
   disturbance.},

   Linked to Oil/Gas Regulations},

Abstract = {Gas flaring is a commonly used practice in the oil and gas sector that
   leads to key air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Here we use
   multipollutant (NO2, SO2) satellite observations from 2005 to 2017 to
   quantify gas flaring activity in Mexico's offshore production cluster,
   which produces similar to 50-70\% of the country's oil and is among the
   world's largest oil fields. We estimate annual flared gas volume ranging
   from 5.5 to 20 x 10(9) m(3) over the Mexican offshore corresponding to
   >40\% associated gas production, which is significantly larger than for
   instance offshore United States where reportedly <3\% of associated gas
   is flared. The 13-year record of satellite-derived gas flaring indicates
   a drastic increase until 2008 and a decline afterward. While the
   increased flaring is associated with efforts to enhance oil production,
   the post-2008 decline is linked to an expanding capacity of associated
   gas utilization, providing a continuing opportunity to reduce flaring
   for environmental and economic benefits.
   Plain Language Summary Gas flaring, a commonly used practice in the oil
   and gas sector to burn off associated natural gas, leads to significant
   economic loss and emissions of key air pollutants (e.g., SO2 and NO2)
   and greenhouse gases (e.g., methane and carbon dioxide). Global efforts
   have been underway to reduce gas flaring, which is considered a viable
   mitigation option to reduce criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gas
   emissions, because of technology availability and potential economic
   gains. In this context, it becomes increasingly important to
   independently quantify and track gas flaring activity over time, as well
   as independently evaluate progress in oil/gas regulations and policy
   implementation, toward mitigation measures. Here we applied a combined
   analysis of satellite NO2 and SO2 observations over offshore Mexico, one
   of the world's largest offshore oil production complexes, during
   2005-2017. The 13-year record showed an increase in gas flaring until
   2008 associated with efforts to enhance oil production and a decline
   after 2008 linked to an expanding capacity of associated gas
   utilization.},

Title = {Review of European energy policies regarding the recent ``carbon

Abstract = {European energy policy has made an effort in the last years in
   developing a coherent strategy towards the definition of a set of goals,
   involving the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and, at the same
   time, increasing renewable energy use. This paper presents the different
   options of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies
   regarding the legislative initiatives implemented in the new European
   energy policy. This new European energy strategy was established taking
   into consideration not only energy demand but also social and
   environmental requirements. Taking that into account, the different
   strategies adopted by the European energy council are discussed and an
   overview of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies-a mitigation
   strategy able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-and the CO2 potential
   utilization were also addressed. Conventional and unconventional CO2
   geological storage/sequestration reservoirs are analysed, taking into
   consideration the different properties of both types of reservoirs.
   Finally, it is possible to conclude that coal seams must play a major
   role in CCS/CCUS technologies, since coal is considered as an efficient
   technological solution to CO2 geological storage/sequestration.},

Title = {Trade-offs and conflicts between urban climate change mitigation and
   adaptation measures: A literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and
   policies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These plans
   and policies are often focused on either mitigation or adaptation. This
   dichotomized approach can be problematic and result in trade-offs. In
   other words, efforts aimed at enhancing mitigation (adaptation) may
   hinder achieving adaptation (mitigation) objectives. Additionally,
   conflicts may arise as there might be inconsistencies between some
   mitigation and adaptation measures. Since trade-offs and conflicts
   between adaptation and mitigation measures can undermine effectiveness
   and efficiency of municipal activities, efforts should be made to avoid
   or minimize them. This study aims to provide a better understanding of
   potential trade-offs and conflicts through reviewing literature on the
   interactions between urban adaptation and mitigation measures. This is
   done through bibliographic analysis and detailed content analyses of
   selected papers. Results of this review show that research on trade-offs
   and conflict has gained traction since the publication of the fourth
   assessment report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
   However, there is still a lack of empirical studies. In particular,
   limited research exists on the Global South cities. Also, according to
   the findings, existing research is mainly focused on trade-offs
   associated with measures related to energy, land use, transport, water,
   building, green infrastructure, and waste sectors. It is found that
   mitigation measures may have negative impacts on adaptation by
   increasing exposure to risks such as the urban heat island effect and
   flooding and/or by eroding livelihood options of poor and marginalized
   groups and causing equity concerns. In contrast, adaptation measures may
   increase greenhouse gas emissions by, among other things, reducing
   efficiency and increasing energy demand. It is discussed that integrated
   assessment frameworks should be utilized to deal with trade-offs and
   conflicts. Finally, some recommendations for better uptake of integrated
   frameworks are provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate change as a threat to biodiversity: An application of the DPSIR

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Climate change and its consequences present one of the most important
   threats to biodiversity, and the functions of ecosystems. The stress on
   biodiversity is far beyond the levels imposed by the natural global
   climatic changes occurring in the recent evolutionary past. It includes
   temperature increases, shifts of climate zones. melting of snow and ice,
   sea level rise, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.
   Natural systems are vulnerable to such changes due to their limited
   adaptive capacity. Based on an analysis using the DPSIR framework, this
   paper discusses some of the important socio-economic driving forces of
   climate change, with a focus on energy use and transportation. The paper
   also analyses observed and potential changes of climate and the
   pressures they exert on biodiversity, the changes in biodiversity, the
   resulting impacts on ecosystem functions, and possible policy responses.
   The latter can be divided into mitigation and adaptation measures. Both
   strategies are needed, mitigation in order to stabilise the greenhouse
   gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and adaptation in order to adjust
   to changes that have already occurred or cannot be avoided. One
   mitigation option, increased biofuel production, which is also a
   response to oil depletion. would change land use patterns and increase
   human appropriation of net primary production of biomass, thereby
   threatening biodiversity. By considering the first order and second
   order impacts of climate change on biodiversity when developing policy
   measures, it will be possible to integrate ecosystem and biodiversity
   protection into decision-making processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We present the greenhouse gas concentrations for the Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and their extensions beyond 2100, the
   Extended Concentration Pathways (ECPs). These projections include all
   major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are a result of a multi-year
   effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. We combine
   a suite of atmospheric concentration observations and emissions
   estimates for greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the historical period
   (1750-2005) with harmonized emissions projected by four different
   Integrated Assessment Models for 2005-2100. As concentrations are
   somewhat dependent on the future climate itself (due to climate
   feedbacks in the carbon and other gas cycles), we emulate median
   response characteristics of models assessed in the IPCC Fourth
   Assessment Report using the reduced-complexity carbon cycle climate
   model MAGICC6. Projected `best-estimate' global-mean surface temperature
   increases (using inter alia a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C) range
   from 1.5 degrees C by 2100 for the lowest of the four RCPs, called both
   RCP3-PD and RCP2.6, to 4.5 degrees C for the highest one, RCP8.5,
   relative to pre-industrial levels. Beyond 2100, we present the ECPs that
   are simple extensions of the RCPs, based on the assumption of either
   smoothly stabilizing concentrations or constant emissions: For example,
   the lower RCP2.6 pathway represents a strong mitigation scenario and is
   extended by assuming constant emissions after 2100 (including net
   negative CO2 emissions), leading to CO2 concentrations returning to 360
   ppm by 2300. We also present the GHG concentrations for one
   supplementary extension, which illustrates the stringent emissions
   implications of attempting to go back to ECP4.5 concentration levels by
   2250 after emissions during the 21(st) century followed the higher RCP6
   scenario. Corresponding radiative forcing values are presented for the
   RCP and ECPs.},

Abstract = {India has the largest dairy industry in the world and accounts for a
   significant share of the global emission of livestock methane (CH4), a
   potent greenhouse gas (GHG). While previous works have examined the
   large-scale livestock CH4 emissions in India, bottom-up studies are
   essential to account for the diverse farm conditions and practices
   across the subcontinent. We developed a Methane Calculator for Indian
   livestock sector using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) Tier 2 methodology for estimating methane emissions from enteric
   fermentation and manure management. Using this calculator, we undertook
   a study of emissions from four dairy farms in the tropical coastal
   district of Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, in June 2019. Livestock
   population and milk production data were collected from the four farms,
   to compute a mean CH4 emission of 0.7183 kg CO2 equivalents/kg of fat
   and protein corrected milk (kg CO (2)e/kg FPCM), with a notable
   farmto-farm variability (63.3\%). Having implemented the latest
   available guidelines outlined by the IPCC, our results are a valuable
   new addition to the existing body of knowledge in the measurement of
   dairy farm GHG emissions. We present this as a pilot study,
   demonstrating a simple method to perform bottom-up investigations of
   dairy GHG emissions and further formulate policy interventions and
   mitigation strategies at the farm level.},

Abstract = {Changes in temperature, precipitation, sea level, and coastal storms
   will likely increase the vulnerability of infrastructure across the
   United States. Using four models that analyze vulnerability, impacts,
   and adaptation, this paper estimates impacts to roads, bridges, coastal
   properties, and urban drainage infrastructure and investigates
   sensitivity to varying greenhouse gas emission scenarios, climate
   sensitivities, and global climate models. The results suggest that the
   impacts of climate change in this sector could be large, especially in
   the second half of the 21st century as sea-level rises, temperature
   increases, and precipitation patterns become more extreme and affect the
   sustainability of long-lived infrastructure. Further, when considering
   sea-level rise, scenarios which incorporate dynamic ice sheet melting
   yield impact model results in coastal areas that are roughly 70 to 80 \%
   higher than results that do not incorporate dynamic ice sheet melting.
   The potential for substantial economic impacts across all infrastructure
   sectors modeled, however, can be reduced by cost-effective adaptation
   measures. Mitigation policies also show potential to reduce impacts in
   the infrastructure sector - a more aggressive mitigation policy reduces
   impacts by 25 to 35 \%, and a somewhat less aggressive policy reduces
   impacts by 19 to 30 \%. The existing suite of models suitable for
   estimating these damages nonetheless covers only a small portion of
   expected infrastructure sector effects from climate change, so much work
   remains to better understand impacts on electric and telecommunications
   networks, rail, and air transportation systems. In addition, the effects
   of climate-induced extreme events are likely to be important, but are
   incompletely understood and remain an emerging area for research.},

Abstract = {Erratic patterns in climate have been forcing people to develop new
   adaptation and mitigation tools. Although world leaders have agreed to
   control greenhouse gases' (GHGs) emission, the current rate of emission
   may not stop global climate change (GCC). Scientists have been working
   to scientifically explain the effects of GHG emission on GCC, however,
   all climate changing phenomena may not be fully understandable now and
   more research is necessary to comprehend those knowledge gaps. Climate
   change has been severely affecting the ecological and socio-economic
   development but these effects can be mitigated by supporting sustainable
   technological and economic development as AMs and MPs. MPs to climate
   change may trade off the negative impacts of GCC and exploring and
   employing lucrative opportunities in blue economy can help in developing
   those AMs and MPs. Moreover, it is not possible to rapidly divert all
   global manufacturing processes into benign technological and economic
   perfection. For this reason, Bangladesh and other coastal countries are
   very aware of the need to introduce cost-effective AMs and MPs and
   society and environment oriented blue economy. Some worthwhile
   adaptation and mitigation strategies are discussed to minimize the
   carbon footprint, as remedies to curtail GCC impacts. Scientific
   relations of GCC with GHG emission and opportunities of blue economy are
   also explored.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping are an increasing
   concern. The paper evaluates whether vessel speed reduction can be a
   potentially cost-effective CO(2) Mitigation option for ships calling on
   US ports. By applying a profit-maximizing equation to estimate
   route-specific, economically-efficient speeds, we explore policy impacts
   of a fuel tax and a speed reduction mandate on CO(2) emissions. The
   profit-maximizing function incorporates opportunity costs associated
   with speed reduction that go unobserved in more traditional marginal
   abatement cost analyses. We find that a fuel tax of about \$150/ton fuel
   will lead to average speed-related CO(2) reductions of about 20-30\%.
   Moreover, a speed reduction mandate targeted to achieve 20\% CO(2)
   reduction in the container fleet costs between \$30 and \$200 per ton
   CO(2) abated, depending on how the fleet responds to a speed reduction
   mandate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Global climate change has become the collective action problem of our
   era. With the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   (UNFCCC) 2015 COP21 Meetings in Paris as the context, the author draws
   upon critical mass theory (CMT) (Oliver and Marwell 1988; Oliver,
   Marwell, and Teixeria 1985) in an attempt to yield greater understanding
   of the international community's ability to achieve climate stability as
   a global public good. Using CMT key elements of collective action
   production functions, group heterogeneity, and interdependence, the
   author explores the world's collective ability to mitigate greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions at the country level. Brief examples from Belize,
   Central America, and other small, vulnerable nations are used to focus
   attention on those countries that cannot make meaningful contribution to
   the collection action. The findings help illustrate why climate change
   is such a difficult collective action problem to address, what broad
   strategies might be required, and how to potentially achieve more
   targeted distribution of international resources.},

   Systematic Review on Adaptation Measures},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Road transport is one of the main contributors to increasing greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions, consequently aggravating global warming, but it is
   also one of the sectors that most suffer from climate change, which
   causes extreme weather events. Thus, strategies, also called adaptation
   measures, have been discussed to minimize the impacts of climate change
   on transport systems and their infrastructure; however, a knowledge gap
   is evident in the literature. Therefore, this article develops a
   systematic review with a bibliometric approach, still scarce in the
   literature, in renowned databases, focusing on studies developed on
   adaptation measures for road infrastructure. The results show that,
   since the development of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an increasing amount
   of studies on the theme have been published in recognized journals such
   as Science of the Total Environment, Energy and Buildings and Urban
   Climate, analyzing climate threats such as intense precipitations and
   high temperatures that have led to biophysical impacts such as flooding
   and urban heat island. In addition, for each type of adverse weather
   condition, many impacts on road infrastructure can be listed, as well as
   ways to detect these impacts, and adaptation measures that can be used
   to minimize these problems.},

Abstract = {Climate change can adversely impact the thermal comfort and energy
   efficiency of the buildings stock. The South Asian countries are
   particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change
   specially in the form of rising temperatures and increasing frequency of
   heat waves. The passive building design measures can be useful in
   mitigating and adapting to the climate change by increasing energy
   efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study
   various passive climate change adaptation measures (PCAMs) have been
   used individually and in form of combinations in order to analyze their
   impact on the energy efficacy of residential buildings in Pakistan. It
   has been found that the natural ventilation and front green wall are the
   most efficient options for reducing the overall energy consumption. By
   implementation of these PCAMs, cooling demand can be decreased by
   27.75\% while heating demand can be reduced by 35\%. Secondly, the
   prospect of net zero-energy building and reduced CO2 emissions are also
   studied. It has been shown that building can achieve net-zero energy on
   an annual basis at every orientation and it can attain the status of
   nearly zero-energy building on a monthly basis. Moreover, emitted CO2
   can be reduced by 31\% by using the renewable energy.},

Title = {Quantifying the direct benefits of cool roofs in an urban setting:
   Reduced cooling energy use and lowered greenhouse gas emissions},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {1-6},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cool roofs, cool pavements, and urban vegetation reduce cooling energy
   use in buildings, lower local air pollution, and decrease greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions from urban areas. To promote widespread and large-scale
   implementation of cool roofs to moderate urban heat-island phenomenon,
   more awareness and understanding of cool roof benefits at the local
   level is needed. As part of an investigation of strategies to mitigate
   urban heat-island effects, field data gathered from a monitoring project
   on cool roofs in India were reviewed. An innovative field-based
   analytical method was developed to quantify cooling energy savings
   resulting from the installation of cool roofs on commercial buildings.
   For buildings monitored in the Metropolitan Hyderabad region, the
   measured annual energy savings from roof-whitening of previously black
   roofs ranged from 20 to 22 kWh/m(2) of roof area, corresponding to a
   cooling energy use reduction of 14-26\%. The application of white
   coatings to uncoated concrete roofs resulted in annual savings of 13-14
   kWh/m(2) of roof area, corresponding to cooling energy savings of 10
   -19\%. The annual direct CO2 reductions associated with the reduced
   cooling energy use were estimated to be 11-12 kg CO2/m(2) of flat roof
   area. Additional field work on various building types and locations will
   help to understand magnitudes of regional or global potential in energy
   savings and GHG emission reductions from applying cool roofs. Knowledge
   about quantified cool roof benefits at both the local and regional level
   may promote the formulation of new policies and programs throughout the
   world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Guide to International Climate Mitigation Policy and Finance
   Frameworks Relevant to the Protection and Restoration of Blue Carbon
   Ecosystems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {The protection, management and restoration of vegetated ecosystems on
   land and in the ocean ('natural climate solutions') can be a useful
   strategy for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to help limit global
   warming. Their potential contribution to reducing net emissions has led
   to the development of policies and financial incentives for their
   protection and restoration. These have in turn created a set of
   expectations among some stakeholders, and interest in expanding these to
   encompass other ecosystems. However, there are specific rules about how
   abatement is calculated in international policy and climate finance, and
   the frameworks and terminology associated with them are often complex.
   This can be a barrier to stakeholders who want to leverage the potential
   of natural climate solutions, sometimes leading to incongruence between
   realised and anticipated benefits. In this article, we attempt to
   outline some of the key international policy and carbon market
   frameworks for coastal `blue carbon' ecosystems, and the extent to which
   different ecosystems are accommodated. Currently, among the coastal
   ecosystems, only mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal marshes
   are typically considered in international policy and carbon market
   frameworks. The defining feature of these ecosystems is that the
   foundation species are plants that grow in sediment (soil). They are the
   only coastal ecosystems currently included in IPCC guidelines for
   national greenhouse gas inventories, and in compliance and voluntary
   carbon markets. There is interest in potentially including other marine
   ecosystems, such as kelp forests and unvegetated tidal flats, into
   carbon accounting frameworks, but there are unresolved questions about
   whether sequestration and storage of carbon by these ecosystems meets
   the rigorous standards required. Voluntary carbon markets have greater
   flexibility than mechanisms linked to national greenhouse gas
   inventories, and so might be early implementers of expanding methods to
   include other ecosystems. Incorporating coastal ecosystems into national
   greenhouse gas inventory is a useful action countries can take that will
   likely help generate incentives for protection and restoration of these
   important ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The destabilization of earth's climate-manifest today in rising sea
   levels, more frequent droughts, deluges, and rising temperatures-demands
   expansive thinking in our infrastructural investments. Such volatility
   imperils coastal and riverine populations, degrades agriculture, and
   fosters water insecurity. We require innovative, multidimensional
   solutions to these public works challenges. Infrastructural ecology is a
   planning paradigm that emulates the closed-loop, sharing logic of
   natural ecosystems. It suggests that features of our power, water,
   sanitation, transport, and food systems may be strategically combined,
   collocated, or otherwise linked for mutual benefit. Such interconnected
   systems then can cascade (pass along) waste energy or water and
   nutrients for another's reuse, arrangements that can reduce pollution
   and greenhouse gas emissions, while lowering demand for new resource
   inputs. Innovative examples from both industrialized as well as
   developing nations illustrate the efficacy of these strategies. The
   exemplary projects described here include smart coastal solutions,
   water-wise innovations, and coping strategies for warming cities.},

Title = {Determining the carbon footprint of indigenous and introduced grape

Abstract = {EU policies and the recent Paris agreement urge for a drastic reduction
   of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent a temperature rise above 2
   degrees C at the end of the century. Global viticulture covers more than
   4.6 million hectares (ha) of land, with a major part of the acreage in
   the semi-arid Mediterranean part of the EU, and needs to adapt to the
   new policy environment. The aim of the study was to determine the
   product carbon footprint (PCF) of indigenous and introduced grape
   varieties through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using as a case study 90
   vineyards on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. PCF determination was
   based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   protocols for greenhouse gas emissions and Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors, with a system boundary from the
   vineyard to the winery/market door. We took into account for the first
   time carbon stock changes in vineyard soil, as implemented in the Cool
   Farm Tool and simulated alternative fertilization/soil management
   strategies to reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration. The
   Mediterranean table grape variety Soultanina (Thompson seedless) had the
   highest PCF at 0.846 kg CO2 equivalents per kg of grapes, followed by
   the two wine varieties, the globally popular Cabernet Sauvignon at 0.556
   and the indigenous white variety Xynisteri at 0.283. Fertilizers and
   field energy use were the carbon hot spots for grapes. The modelled
   scenario for footprint mitigation showed that the PCF of all three
   varieties can decrease by 40-67\% after applying locally produced animal
   manure and reducing tillage frequency. The PCF of indigenous Xynisteri
   can get close to zero. Validation of mitigation practices through
   field-research is an essential step for the compliance of viticulture
   with global GHG emissions mitigation targets. (C) 2017 Published by

Title = {Port greenhouse gas emission reduction: Port and public authorities?
   implementation schemes},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ports are unavoidable hubs of anthropogenic emissions owing to the
   dependence of landside and seaside operations on fossil fuels.
   Additionally, designing and implementing decarbonisation measures to
   mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
   ports and beyond is a difficult issue. Therefore, this study aims to
   identify and analyse policy instruments and tools - implementation
   schemes - which ports implement to reduce GHG emissions, ultimately
   assisting in driving the uptake of technical and operational measures by
   port polluters, i.e. port, land transport, and shipping operators. This
   study was conducted by means of a systematic literature review (112
   studies), and informed by a four-dimensional conceptual framework, i.e.
   port policymakers, port polluters, uptake of GHG emission reduction
   technical and operational measures, and the implementation schemes. The
   study differentiated between the technical and operational measures on
   one hand, and implementation schemes on the other. In addition to
   collating the schemes under five homogenous groups and nine categories;
   their characteristics, best practices, limitations and key issues,
   including opportunities, were discussed. Findings indicate that despite
   there being various challenges and issues in the implementation schemes,
   port policymakers, either public or port authorities, can utilise a
   variety of measures to reduce polluters' GHG emissions while at the same
   time maintaining business integrity. Nevertheless, monitoring of
   emissions, and identification of best performing combinations of
   implementation schemes along with inter-port and maritime stakeholders'
   and port policymakers' collaboration are the suggested way forward to
   better implement the measures and create a level playing field. While
   the results of this study contribute to improving the understanding of
   implementation of port GHG emission reduction, and enable port
   policymakers to make reliable decisions, it also contributes to academic
   knowledge and provides aspiring researchers with a fertile future
   research agenda.},

Volume = {100},

Abstract = {Understanding public awareness about climate change is important in
   directing policy on adaptation and mitigation policies. This paper
   examines urban residents' awareness and concern about climate change and
   their autonomous behaviour and mitigation measures in the coastal city
   of Mombasa through a survey of 290 subjects. The study established that
   most (96.6\%) residents of the city are aware that climate change is
   taking place and link its causes mainly on deforestation, fuel
   combustion and nature but less to household activities and poor waste
   disposal. Although they were able to identify its consequences as an
   increase in average temperature, occurrence of infectious diseases and
   flooding, there are certain misconceptions such as ozone layer depletion
   (67.6\%) and earthquake/tremor (12.1\%). The study established that a
   number of residents affirmed some autonomous adaptive behaviour such as
   staying indoors during extreme temperatures and having an emergency kit
   at home. The results of the study demonstrate that awareness and concern
   about climate change had strongest effect on reduced energy consumption
   at home, and that the strongest barrier to taking mitigation steps is
   lack of necessary skills. The study concludes by recommending
   sensitization of urban public on the negative contributions of household
   activities and poor waste disposal to the concentration of greenhouse
   gases and the need to focus campaigns on personal mitigation activities.},

Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {145-166},
Abstract = {Increases in greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about potential
   global climate change are stimulating worldwide interest in the
   feasibility of capture, disposal, and utilization of CO2 from large
   energy systems. Technology to capture CO2 from power plant flue gas,
   while energy intensive and expensive, is commercially available. Capture
   from advanced combustion systems offers a further opportunity to
   significantly reduce cost and energy requirements of CO2 capture
   compared to that from today's pulverized coal power plants. No viable
   disposal options exist today for large quantities of captured CO2. Ocean
   disposal of CO2 and geological storage, especially in depleted oil and
   gas wells, are leading candidates. Although some niche utilization may
   occur, utilization seems unlikely to become a major sequestration
   option. Since CO2 capture and sequestration is a relatively expensive
   mitigation option, it can be regarded as an insurance policy. However,
   since CO2 mitigation options are few in number, continued research to
   reduce the costs of CO2 capture and to develop feasible sequestration
   options is important.},

Abstract = {Biological processes driven by photosynthesis cycle through the
   atmosphere well over an order of magnitude more CO2 than is currently
   emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels. Already human activities
   control and appropriate almost half the primary photosynthetic
   productivity of the planet. Better management of natural and man-made
   ecosystems affords many opportunities for mitigation of greenhouse
   gases, through sink enhancements, source reductions and substitution of
   fossil fuels with biofuels. Biofuels can be recovered from most organic
   wastes, from agricultural and forestry residues, and from biomass
   produced solely for energy use. However, the currently low costs of
   fossil fuels limits the markets for biofuels. Accounting for the
   greenhouse gas mitigation value of biofuels would significantly increase
   their contribution to world fuel supplies, estimated to be currently
   equivalent to about 15\% of fossil fuel usage.
   Another limiting factor in expanding the use of biofuels is the
   relatively low solar energy conversion efficiencies of photosynthesis.
   Currently well below 1\% of solar energy is converted into biomass
   energy even by intensive agricultural or forestry systems, with peak
   conversion efficiencies about 2 to 3 \% for sugar cane or microalgae
   cultures. One approach to increase photosynthetic efficiencies, being
   developed at the University of California Berkeley, is to reduce the
   amount of light-gathering chlorophyll in microalgae and higher plants.
   This would reduce mutual shading and also increase photosynthetic
   efficiencies under full sunlight intensities.
   Estimates of the potential of photosynthetic greenhouse mitigation
   processes vary widely. However, even conservative estimates for biofuels
   substituting for fossil fuels project the potential to reduce a large
   fraction of current increases in atmospheric CO2 levels. Biofuels
   production will require integration with existing agronomic, forestry
   and animal husbandry systems, and improved utilization-conversion
   processes. The diffuse nature of biomass resources requires relatively
   small-scale processes for their utilization as solid fuels or conversion
   to liquid and gaseous fuels. Earlier proposals for enormous energy
   plantations feeding large power plants, or for establishing huge ocean
   kelp farms, were impractical. As are some recent ``geoengineering{''}
   proposals, such as ocean fertilization.
   In biomass utilization, combustion is generally preferable to more
   complex processes, such as thermal or biochemical conversions to oils
   and alcohols. The co-firing of biomass in fossil power plants avoids
   many of the scale, procurement, and efficiency limitations of
   stand-alone systems and provides significant near-term opportunities for
   CO2 mitigation. Landfill gas recovery, due to the large greenhouse gas
   forcing of methane gas, is another currently available technology that
   can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Wastes and residues
   provide many opportunities for biofuels production and CO2 mitigation.
   Mitigating global warming with biological processes requires overcoming
   many scientific, technological, financial, institutional, regulatory
   and, perhaps most important, environmental barriers. This necessitates a
   major, world-wide and long-term, sustained research, development and
   implementation effort.},

Journal = {NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Climate change will drive major perturbations of the West African summer
   monsoon. A zonal contrast in precipitation will develop at the end of
   the century, with an increase in precipitation over the central Sahel
   and a decrease in precipitation over the western Sahel. Such a zonal
   contrast results from the antagonist effects of the fast (due to
   enhanced radiative warming over land, and over the North Hemisphere,
   relative to the South Hemisphere) and slow \{associated with long-term
   changes in oceanic circulation) responses of precipitation to increasing
   greenhouse gases. While such changes have already been assessed, less
   attention has been given to their temporality, an issue of major
   importance to promote efficient mitigation and adaptation measures.
   Here, we analyse the future evolution of precipitation changes
   decomposed into a fast and a slow response, showing that the fast
   response dominates the slow one. From this evidence, we highlight that
   mitigation strategies may be successful at reducing the effect of
   climate change on Sahel precipitation within a few decades, by muting
   the fast response. This decomposition also allows for a better
   understanding of the uncertainty of climate model predictions in Africa.},

   needs. Although the desalination process offers many advantages, there
   are rising concerns about possible adverse environmental impacts.
   Generally, environmental impacts can be generated both in the
   construction and operation of desalination plants. A major issue of
   desalination is the co-produced waste called `brine' or `reject' which
   has a high salinity along with chemical residuals and is discharged into
   the marine environment. In addition to brine, other main issues are the
   high energy consumption of the desalination and brine treatment
   technologies as well as the air pollution due to emissions of greenhouse
   gasses (GHGs) and air pollutants. Other issues include entrainment and
   entrapment of marine species, and heavy use of chemicals. The purpose of
   this review is to analyze the potential impacts of desalination and
   brine treatment on the environment and suggest mitigation measures.},

Title = {Electricity Generation in Saudi Arabia: Tracing Opportunities and
   Challenges to Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {116163-116182},
Abstract = {The electrical energy demand of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has
   been observing a surging growth due to high population growth and
   urbanization rate. The generation mostly comes from the burning of
   petroleum products. The electricity sector emits more than one-third of
   the national greenhouse gas (GHG) of the country. Thus, it is essential
   to reduce the GHG from the electricity generation sector to maintain
   sustainability. This article mainly concentrates on the existing
   electricity generation and focuses on the Kingdom's GHG emissions
   mitigation initiatives. Although the use of natural gas and the number
   of cogeneration plants have been increased in electricity generation,
   the country has also been focusing on other initiatives, including the
   adaptation of combined cycle power plants, carbon capture, utilization,
   and sequestration (CCUS), renewable and alternative energy sources, and
   various utility-scale energy efficiency measures. The ambitious and
   inspirational renewable energy (RE) targets of the Saudi Vision 2030
   will significantly facilitate GHG emission avoidance, which will support
   the Kingdom to meet its Nationally Determined Contributions. This
   article recommends various mitigation measures, including the usage of
   the efficient internal combustion engine, poly-generation, combined heat
   and power (CHP) systems, deployment of renewable resources in the
   distribution and microgrid systems, bio-mass engine, and ocean thermal
   energy conversion plants. The decision-makers and the researchers will
   find the discussions and recommendations helpful in determining suitable
   and appropriate mitigation initiatives and technologies.},

Abstract = {The reduction of urban heat island (UHI) and carbon emission is of great
   importance for thermal environment of urban residential areas. This
   paper aimed to establish a method to analyze the effect of different
   underlying surface layouts on the reduction of heat island intensity and
   carbon emission. Taking Tianjin, China, as a case study area, a
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, satellite-based remote sensing
   retrieval technology, and orthogonal experimental design were performed
   to investigate and quantify the performance of mitigation strategies
   (i.e., urban green space or water body, cool/high reflectivity pavement,
   and reflective roofs and facades) on UHI. The results indicated that
   urban green space is the most natural and effective mitigation strategy,
   while the widespread application of cool/high reflectivity materials is
   suggested as a mitigation strategy for building height more than 10 m
   above the ground. Application of urban water body is the next preferred
   strategy for air at 1.5 m pedestrian level. Green roofs, rainwater
   gardens, and permeable brick pavements are also more feasible in
   high-density cities for mitigating the UHI effect. The above mitigation
   and adaptation strategies of community scale can be acted on UHI and as
   a global urban climate change response.},

Abstract = {Whether natural wetlands serve as the source or sink of greenhouse gases
   (GHGs) remains uncertain. Wetlands in China are diverse in type and
   abundant in quantity and differ greatly in spatial distribution,
   environmental conditions, and GHG fluxes. However, few studies focused
   on the differences in GHG emissions from different types of natural
   wetlands. Here, we adopted strict data collection criteria to create
   comprehensive and detailed datasets of fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2),
   methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the marsh, coastal, lake,
   and river wetlands in China, and relevant environmental variables. Our
   study synthesized 265 field observations on GHGs that lasted at least
   one year (covering both the growing season and non-growing season) from
   109 studies, among which CO2 measurements using the opaque chamber
   method were not included for eliminating the influence of absence of
   photosynthesis on net CO2 accounting. We found that CH4 contributed the
   largest warming effect among the three types of GHGs, and coastal and
   river wetlands respectively acted as the mitigators and motivators of
   global warming among the four types of wetlands. Correlation and
   regression analyses suggested that geographic location, soil moisture
   and organic carbon, and contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved
   oxygen jointly drove wetland GHG fluxes. The comprehensive global
   warming potential of Chinese natural wetlands was estimated as 427 Tg
   CO2-equivalents year(-1), which might result from increased wetland
   drainage, reclamation, and external nutrient inputs. This study
   highlights the incorporation of the full year-round GHG monitoring data
   without using opaque chambers to measure CO2 flux when extrapolating net
   GHG emissions and gives implications for natural wetland management and
   global warming mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Urban climate change in cold-climate cities of Canada is an important
   consideration for global climate moderation, energy consumption, citizen
   safety and wellbeing. Recently, many Canadian cities have started to pay
   attention to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. They
   need policy-relevant data and analysis in these efforts. The current
   data mostly focuses on the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions
   levels rather than providing specific adaptation strategies on the urban
   scale.
   In this research, we analyze and demonstrate how street vegetation
   planting, albedo and urban canopy characteristics affect urban climate
   in a specific Canadian city, Montreal. We use ENVI-met (a
   three-dimensional computer model which analyzes micro-scale thermal
   interactions within urban environments) to calculate the sky view factor
   (SVF) for a 300 m x 300 m section of the city, and simulate the
   environmental conditions including air temperature (Ta), human weighted
   mean radiant temperature (MRTh-w), wind speed, and physiologically
   equivalent temperature (PET) at the community scale. These simulation
   comparisons demonstrate the effects on each environmental factor for a
   typical summer day and provide hints for mitigation of the urban heat
   island (UHI) and new urban development. The effectiveness of each UHI
   mitigation strategy is evaluated for providing guidelines for policy
   development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article provides a synthesis of the latest observational trends and
   projections for the future of the Arctic. First, the Arctic is already
   changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic
   temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75\% volume loss) demonstrate
   climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the
   Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature
   increases to near 2 degrees C will leave the Arctic a much different
   environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted
   permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic
   temperature increase of +4 degrees C. Second, even under ambitious
   emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including
   Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to
   accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future
   Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra
   greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation.
   Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an
   obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these
   trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and
   mitigation actions.},

Abstract = {With entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, climate change
   negotiators are turning their attention to the question, `Where do we go
   from here?. A key component of answering this question is in
   understanding the implications for society of alternative long-term
   goals for greenhouse gas concentrations. One challenge in ongoing
   negotiations is whether and how to deal with meanings of `dangerous
   interference' as outlined in Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on
   Climate Change. This study addresses Article 2 by suggesting the use of
   long-term goals to guide decisions about the stringency and timing of
   future climate change commitments. Focusing on mitigation policy
   benefits and, in particular, on avoiding long-term climate impacts, a
   number of management approaches and their implications are highlighted.
   After discussing some challenges of using scientific knowledge to
   monitor and manage progress, we look at what we can learn from current
   climate change global impact literature. Solid benchmark indicators
   appear to be available from global mean temperature change, ecosystems
   and coastal zone impacts information. We conclude by arguing for global
   goal-setting based on climate change effects and the use of indicators
   in these areas as part of post-2012 climate change negotiations.
   Aggregate global impacts suggest that 3-4 degrees C of global mean
   temperature increase by 2100 (compared to a reference period of 1990)
   may be a threshold beyond which all known sector impacts are negative
   and rising with increasing levels of warming. However, marginal benefits
   may accrue at lower levels of mean change. Thus, a prudent policy might
   aim for significantly lower levels and slower rates of global warming.},

Abstract = {Environmental problems are becoming a global problem today, ranging from
   environmental pollution, greenhouse gas effects, forest fires,
   landslides, to abrasion. The causes of this environmental problem are
   due to natural factors and human activities. Environmental damage caused
   by human activities and natural elements is disasters such as abrasion,
   landslide or high tide. This study aims to describe the approach of
   disaster mitigation implemented by the Government of Merauke Regency to
   prevent continuous environmental damage. This study used a literature
   study approach; data were obtained from observation and relevant
   literature sources. The results of the research show that in the effort
   to prevent continuous environmental damage, then the mitigation approach
   that has been implemented by the Government of Merauke Regency was
   building wave breaker, mangrove planting, making policies governing
   coastal sand mining and dissemination of information. That approach was
   intended so that the consequences of environmental damage that lead to
   abrasion and cause loss of shoreline, damage to public facilities and
   residences can be prevented as much as possible.},

Abstract = {Global-mean temperature and sea-level implications are calculated for
   four preliminary emissions scenarios presented elsewhere in this issue.
   Total anthropogenic temperature change in the year 2100 ranges from
   1.3-4.0 degreesC using the four scenarios for upper and lower bounds on
   emissions and high and low values for the climate sensitivity. The lower
   bound is higher than that given in the IPCC Second Assessment Report,
   due mainly to lower future sulfur dioxide emissions. These lower
   emissions also have the effect of reducing uncertainties associated with
   sulfate aerosol forcing. Significant future climate changes occur in all
   scenarios, indicating that adaptation policies need to be considered as
   an important component of climate-change policy. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Volume = {416},
Number = {6882},
Pages = {723-726},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Predictions of temperature rise over the twenty-first century are
   necessarily uncertain, both because the sensitivity of the climate
   system to changing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations, as well as
   the rate of ocean heat uptake, is poorly quantified(1,2) and because
   future influences on climate-of anthropogenic as well as natural
   origin-are difficult to predict(3). Past observations have been used to
   help constrain the range of uncertainties in future warming rates, but
   under the assumption of a particular scenario of future emissions(4).
   Here we investigate the relative importance of the uncertainty in
   climate response to a particular emissions scenario versus the
   uncertainty caused by the differences between future emissions scenarios
   for our estimates of future change. We present probabilistic forecasts
   of global-mean temperatures for four representative scenarios for future
   emissions(5), obtained with a comprehensive climate model. We find that,
   in the absence of policies to mitigate climate change, global-mean
   temperature rise is insensitive to the differences in the emissions
   scenarios over the next four decades. We also show that in the future,
   as the signal of climate change emerges further, the predictions will
   become better constrained.},

Title = {Life-Cycle Approach to Healthy Airport Terminal Buildings:
   Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Mitigation Strategies for Addressing the
   Pollutants that Affect Climate Change and Human Health},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Abstract = {The potential environmental and human health impacts associated with
   constructing and operating terminal buildings is explored for commercial
   airports in the United States. Research objectives are to quantify: (1)
   baseline and mitigated greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria air pollutant
   (CAP) emissions; (2) operational costs; and (3) climate change damages
   from terminal building construction and materials, operational energy
   consumption, water consumption and wastewater generation, and solid
   waste generation. An Excel-based decision-support tool, Airport Terminal
   Environmental Support Tool (ATEST), has been created to allow
   stakeholders to conduct preliminary assessments of current baseline and
   potential mitigated impacts. Emissions are quantified using a life-cycle
   approach that accounts for cradle-to-grave effects. Climate change and
   human health indicators are characterized using EPA's Tool for Reduction
   and Assessment of Chemical Impact (TRACI) factors. ATEST is applied to
   multiple case study airports- Reno/Tahoe International (RNO), Pittsburgh
   International (PIT), Newark Liberty International (EWR), Seattle-Tacoma
   International (SEA), San Francisco International (SFO), and
   Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL)-to demonstrate its
   scalability and capability to assess varying spatial factors. Across all
   airports, electricity mix and construction are significant in
   determining GHG and CAP emissions, respectively. A sensitivity analysis
   of GHG emissions for the SFO case study reveals that the electricity
   mix, amount of electricity consumed within the terminal, terminal gross
   area, and amount of compostables in the solid waste stream have the most
   impact on increasing annual GHG emissions. ATEST represents a crucial
   first step in helping stakeholders to make decisions that will lead to
   healthier, more sustainable airport terminals.},

Title = {Role of Biochar in Carbon Sequestration and Greenhouse Gas Mitigation},
Booktitle = {BIOCHAR APPLICATIONS IN AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {141-165},
Abstract = {Global warming and associated climate change are becoming a threat to
   almost all the ecosystems on the earth. According to the
   intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) special report 2019,
   the global mean surface (land and ocean) temperature has been increased
   by 0.87 degrees C while mean of land surface air temperature has
   increased by 1.53 degrees C since 1850-2015. Climate change is affecting
   food security and human life due to warming, changing precipitation
   patterns, and the greater frequency of some extreme events. The main
   cause of global warming is the continuous increase in the atmospheric
   concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2, CH4, N2O and
   fluorinated gases due to several anthropogenic activities. Therefore,
   reducing the increasing concentration of GHG is necessary to slow down
   global warming and climate change. Among several options of greenhouse
   mitigation, application of biochar into the soil is gaining popularity
   due to several advantages over other options. Biochar is a highly stable
   form of carbon derived from pyrolysis of biomass at relatively low
   temperatures. Application of biochar into the soil has been reported to
   provide multiple benefits like increase in crop yield, nutrient and
   water use efficiency and several environmental benefits. Recalcitrant
   nature, relatively higher carbon content and easily available feedstock
   make biochar a highly sustainable and quick option for carbon
   sequestration into the soil. Biochar application into the soil not only
   helps in carbon sequestration but also provides a better option for
   managing agricultural residues. The application of biochar has also
   reported for reducing a considerable amount of methane and nitrous oxide
   emission from the agricultural field due to its priming effect on the
   soil. Biochar yield, physical properties, and carbon content varies with
   the type of feedstock and pyrolysis condition. Therefore, the rate of
   carbon sequestration and mitigation of greenhouse gas is also highly
   variable, however, the biochar application ultimately leads to a
   positive contribution towards climate change mitigation. However, most
   of the reported benefits are confined to laboratory and field trial at
   institute level, widespread adoption of biochar on farmer's field is
   still lacking. In the present chapter, all the aspects of biochar
   towards carbon sequestration and greenhouse mitigation have been well
   discussed.},

   emission and improve energy efficiency: A review},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {160},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study reviews and categorises ports' technical and operational
   measures to reduce greenhouse gas emission and improve energy
   efficiency. Through a systematic review, both measures in the portside
   including land transport, and in the ship-port interface, were
   identified and structured into 7 main categories and 19 sub-categories
   based on 214 studies. The measures' characteristics, abatement
   potential, best practices and key issues were clarified. The results
   show that there is insufficient research on ports in developing
   countries, as research is centred on developed countries' ports.
   Furthermore, it is unlikely that any single measure may lead to port
   decarbonisation owing to varying abatement potential, complexity, and
   cost. Therefore, assessments of feasibility and effectiveness to
   identify the best combination of measures are vital steps forward. In
   addition to the highlighted fertile research areas, the result of
   measures categorisation is considered a tool for policymakers and a
   basis for researchers to verify future agendas.},

Abstract = {To better understand the role of sustainable urban development in

   for 42\% of total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, these findings
   highlight the importance of smart growth policies to build more compact
   and transit friendly cities as a crucial part of any strategic efforts
   to mitigate GHG emissions and to stabilize climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {The Effects of Organic Matter Amendments on Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Abstract = {There is concern that widespread restoration and/or creation of
   freshwater wetlands may present a radiative forcing hazard because of
   the potential for methane (CH4) emissions. Yet data on greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions from restored wetlands are sparse and there has been
   little investigation into the GHG effects of amending wetland soils with
   organic matter (OM), a practice used to improve function of mitigation
   wetlands in the Eastern United States. In this study we measure GHG
   emissions across an OM gradient at the Charles City Wetland (CCW) in
   Charles City County, Virginia. We found soils heavily loaded with OM
   emit significantly more CO2 than those that have received little or no
   OM. CH4 emissions from CCW are low compared to reference wetlands and
   show no relationship with the loading rate of added OM or total soil
   carbon. We conclude that adding moderate amounts (< similar to 150 kg
   m(-2)) of OM to the CCW does not greatly increase GHG emissions, while
   the addition of high amounts of OM produces additional CO2, but not CH4.
   CH4 flux is highest under flooded conditions during warmer months but it
   still a modest contribution to global warming potential compared to soil
   CO2 flux.},

Abstract = {Global warming is a serious threat to humans and other creatures'
   existence. In recent years, it has led to devastating consequences among
   which storms, as witnessed in all over the world, can be pointed out. It
   has also caused sea and ocean levels rise, the soil grows dry, and the
   quantity and quality of agricultural crops decrease. Moreover, the
   extinction of species is the other side of the problem. Political
   conflicts caused by the migration of people from poor and crisis-hit
   countries to rich countries can be mentioned as one of the other
   consequences. Human activities, such as vast consumptions of fossil
   fuels, which release gases including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
   (CH4) into the atmosphere, preserve the temperature in the atmosphere as
   the main causes of global warming. However, some natural phenomena can
   alter climatic conditions around the world. Couple of studies has proven
   that the role of human is more destructive than natural ones. The Paris
   World Summit on global warming and climate change has underscored the
   importance of country's combat against this phenomenon. Biotechnology,
   as a leading science, provides novel solutions for this crisis and plays
   an inevitable role in reducing greenhouse gases. Genetic engineering
   methods such as genome editing, or gene transfer could suitably overcome
   the severe environmental conditions by increasing the efficiency of
   photosynthesis and overall biomass. Optimizing biofuel production and
   providing environmentally friendly fuels that are easily feasible via
   biotechnology are the possible methods that reduce greenhouse gases and
   ultimately control the global warming. Here, in this review, we discuss
   the possible ways that biotechnology can help to ameliorate the global
   warming effect.},

Abstract = {CO2 emissions from maritime transport represent around 3\% of total
   annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These emissions are
   assumed to increase by 150-250\% in 2050 in business-as-usual scenarios
   with a tripling of world trade, while achieving a 1.52 C climate target
   requires net zero GHG emissions across all economic sectors.
   Consequentially, the maritime sector is facing the challenge to
   significantly reduce its GHG emissions as contribution to the
   international ambition to limit the effects of climate change.
   This article presents the results of a review of around 150 studies, to
   provide a comprehensive overview of the CO2 emissions reduction
   potentials and measures published in literature. It aims to identify the
   most promising areas, i.e. technologies and operational practices, and
   quantify the combined mitigation potential. Results show a significant
   variation in reported CO2 reduction potentials across reviewed studies.
   In addition, no single measure is sufficient to achieve meaningful GHG
   reductions. Emissions can be reduced by more than 75\%, based on current
   technologies and by 2050, through a combination of measures if policies
   and regulations are focused on achieving these reductions. In terms of
   emissions per freight unit transported, it is possible to reduce
   emissions by a factor of 4-6. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Despite an increasing likelihood of considerable global warming over the
   coming century, there is limited greenhouse mitigation action undertaken
   by the international community (Carraro and Massetti 2011). It is in
   individual and collective socio-economic and environmental interest to
   embark on strong mitigation action globally. The present study analyses
   alternative global carbon pathways to achieve greenhouse gas emission
   reductions in the form of an illustrative and exploratory exercise. The
   potential economic and environmental implications of the alternative
   global carbon pathways are then assessed. The alternative carbon
   pathways analysed in this study include a high, medium and low carbon
   pathways that represent small, modest and large improvements in
   technological advancements in low emission intensive stationary and
   transport energy generation and energy efficiency respectively. These
   alternative carbon pathways are then compared to a reference case that
   corresponds to the baseline scenario used in the 2008 Garnaut Climate
   Change Review (Garnaut 2008). We use CSIRO's current version of the
   Global Integrated Assessment Model (GIAM-XP) (Gunasekera et al., 2008,
   Harman et al., 2008, Garnaut, 2008 and Scealy et al., 2011) to undertake
   the impacts of the alternative carbon pathway scenarios.
   Our analysis indicates that concerted efforts towards improvements in
   technological advancements in low emission intensive stationary and
   transport energy generation and energy efficiency could help reduce the
   atmospheric CO2 concentration levels, radiative forcing and global
   temperature over time in a progressive manner across the scenarios
   analysed in this paper. Failing to do so is likely to have significant
   adverse impacts associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration
   levels, radiative forcing and global temperature over the coming
   decades. For example, failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
   substantially over the coming decades will have significant consequences
   in terms of increases in temperature across many parts of the world
   relative to what would otherwise be.
   Key parts of the human-earth system including water, coastal
   communities, natural ecosystems, and agriculture are likely to be highly
   vulnerable to the projected climate change illustrated in our analysis
   unless significant mitigation measures are undertaken in the foreseeable
   future to set the global economy on a low to medium carbon pathway. This
   would require a portfolio of mitigation measures including significant
   improvements in technological advancements in low emission intensive
   stationary and transport energy generation and energy efficiency, at
   national, regional and global levels.
   It is important to recognize that global economic output continues to
   increase over time, albeit at a slower rate of growth under the
   alternative carbon pathway scenarios compared with the reference case.
   However, in the long term, productivity changes and the structural
   adjustments underpinning the global economic activity tend to have a
   more favorable impact overall, particularly, in the presence of
   significant improvements in technological advancements in low emission
   intensive stationary and transport energy generation and energy
   efficiency. We argue in the paper that there is an increasing need for
   additional research into improving our understanding of inter-fuel
   substitution possibilities and of the less emission/energy intensive
   technologies available for particular industries.},

Abstract = {Any human intervention in environmental systems carries risk of adverse
   consequences. Planetary-scale intervention carries the potential for
   planetary-scale risk. Continued emissions of greenhouse gases represent
   an unintentional planetary-scale human intervention in the climate
   system, which is resulting in global consequences that will become
   increasingly harmful to both human and environmental systems. The most
   appropriate response to this problem is to decrease the level of overall
   human intervention in the climate system by decreasing greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, owing to the slow progress of mitigation efforts,
   many scientists are starting to suggest alternate climate interventions
   as a strategy to decrease or avert some of the anticipated impacts of
   global warming. In this review, I will consider the role of some forms
   of climate intervention those aimed at accelerating the slow natural
   removal of atmospheric CO, as possible complements to aggressive
   mitigation policy, for the purpose of expanding the range of attainable
   long-term climate targets.},

Abstract = {The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change calls for the avoidance of
   ``dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system{''}.
   Among the many plausible choices, dangerous interference with the
   climate system may be interpreted as anthropogenic radiative forcing
   causing distinct and widespread climate change impacts such as a
   widespread demise of coral reefs or a disintegration of the West
   Antarctic ice sheet. The geological record and numerical models suggest
   that limiting global warming below critical temperature thresholds
   significantly reduces the likelihood of these eventualities. Here we
   analyze economically optimal policies that may ensure this
   risk-reduction. Reducing the risk of a widespread coral reef demise
   implies drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within decades.
   Virtually unchecked greenhouse gas emissions to date (combined with the
   inertia of the coupled natural and human systems) may have already
   committed future societies to a widespread demise of coral reefs.
   Policies to reduce the risk of a West Antarctic ice sheet disintegration
   allow for a smoother decarbonization of the economy within a century and
   may well increase consumption in the long run.},

Abstract = {The air pollution control and evaluation has acquired high importance in
   the modern world. Depending on the per-manence of the pollutants in the
   atmosphere, the pollution could be local, regional or global.
   The contribution of many developing countries, such as Cuba, to global
   climate change is very low. In these cases, while providing importance
   to reducing national emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), the priority
   actions would be addressed to adapting to climate change and to reducing
   emissions that determine local and regional pollution, which have
   adverse effects, especially on health.
   The present paper examines Cuba's contribution to global greenhouse
   gases emissions, which turns out to be modest. Then, the problem of
   local pollution in the nation is addressed, reporting data from
   experimental measurements and comparing them with national regulations.
   The methodology employed and the results obtained on the levels of
   pollution generated by the national energy sector and corresponding
   impacts on health and its costs are discussed. The work may provide
   support for decision makers on the priorities in the use of available
   resources, with the aim of environmental preservation. Some approaches
   about how to deal the right balance of local and global responsibilities
   for countries as Cuba, are also presented. As the development of those
   countries proceeds, their contribution to GHG emissions is expected to
   become more relevant. Some planned countermeasures for reducing such a
   trend are illustrated.},

Abstract = {One of the major implications of climate change for tourism destinations
   is the potential impact that mitigation policies aimed at reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions from the rapidly growing aviation sector could
   have on travel costs and tourist mobility. Such impact is particularly
   salient for long-haul destinations. Recently tourism organisations such
   as the unwto have also expressed concern that aviation sector-focused
   mitigation policies in wealthy nations that are the major international
   tourism outbound markets will negatively affect tourism development and
   wealth transfers to tourism-dependent developing nations. This article
   reviews emerging climate policies in major tourism outbound markets that
   have direct implications for the aviation sector and examines the
   potential consequences for travel costs and tourism demand in 10
   tourism-dependent less developed island states with diverse geographic
   and tourism market characteristics. The analysis confirms that aviation
   mitigation policies would affect tourism demand to these nations.
   `Carbon smart' tourism market restructuring approaches to reduce the
   emissions intensity of tourism, and market risk to climate policy
   changes anticipated over the next 10-20 years, are subsequently
   discussed.},

Title = {Water conservation benefits of urban heat mitigation},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Many cities globally are seeking strategies to counter the consequences
   of both a hotter and drier climate. While urban heat mitigation
   strategies have been shown to have beneficial effects on health, energy
   consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, their implications for water
   conservation have not been widely examined. Here we use a suite of
   satellite-supported regional climate simulations in California to show
   that broad implementation of cool roofs, a heat mitigation strategy, not
   only results in significant cooling, but can also meaningfully decrease
   outdoor water consumption by reducing evaporative and irrigation water
   demands. Irrigation water consumption across the major metropolitan
   areas is reduced by up to 9\% and irrigation water savings per capita
   range from 1.8 to 15.4 gallons per day across 18 counties examined.
   Total water savings are found to be the highest in Los Angeles county,
   reaching about 83 million gallons per day. Cool roofs are a valuable
   solution for addressing the adaptation and mitigation challenges faced
   by multiple sectors in California.},

   Climate Liability},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Due to market failures that allow uncompensated negative externalities
   from burning fossil fuels, there has been a growing call for climate
   change-related litigation targeting polluting companies. To determine
   the most intensive carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting facilities in order
   prioritize liability for climate lawsuits, and risk mitigation
   strategies for identified companies as well as their insurers and
   investors, two methods are compared: (1) the conventional point-source
   method and (2) the proposed bottleneck method, which considers all
   emissions that a facility enables rather than only what it emits.
   Results indicate that the top ten CO(2)emission bottlenecks in the U.S.
   are predominantly oil (47\%) and natural gas (44\%) pipelines. Compared
   to traditional point-source emissions methods, this study has
   demonstrated that a comprehensive bottleneck calculation is more
   effective. By employing an all-inclusive approach to calculating a
   polluting entity's CO(2)emissions, legal actions may be more accurately
   focused on major polluters, and these companies may preemptively
   mitigate their pollution to curb vulnerability to litigation and risk.
   The bottleneck methodology reveals the discrete link in the chain of the
   fossil-fuel lifecycle that is responsible for the largest amount of
   emissions, enabling informed climate change mitigation and risk
   management efforts.},

Title = {Soil salinity and its associated effects on soil microorganisms,
   greenhouse gas emissions, crop yield, biodiversity and desertification:
   A review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {843},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Significant research has been conducted on the effects of soil salinity
   issue on agricultural productivity. However, limited consideration has
   been given to its critical effects on soil biogeochemistry (e.g., soil
   microorganisms, soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions),
   land desertification, and biodiversity loss. This article is based on
   synthesis of information in 238 articles published between 1989 and 2022
   on these effects of soil salinity. Principal findings are as follows:
   (1) salinity affects microbial community composition and soil enzyme
   activities due to changes in osmotic pressure and ion effects; (2) soil
   salinity reduces soil organic carbon (SOC) content and alters GHG
   emissions, which is a serious issue under intensifying agriculture and
   global warming scenarios; (3) soil salinity can reduce crop yield up to
   58 \%; (4) soil salinity, even at low levels, can cause profound
   alteration in soil biodiversity; (5) due to severe soil salinity, some
   soils are reaching critical desertification status; (6) innovate
   mitigation strategies of soil salinity need to be approached in a way
   that should support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
   (UN-SDGs). Knowledge gaps still exist mainly in the effects of salinity
   especially, responses of GHG emissions and biodiversity. Previous
   experiences quantifying soil salinity effects remained small-scale, and
   inappropriate research methods were sometimes applied for investigating
   soil salinity effects. Therefore, further studies are urgently required
   to improve our understanding on the effects of salinity, address
   salinity effects in larger-scale, and develop innovative research
   methods.},

Abstract = {Many aspects of the Californian approach to controlling the greenhouse
   gases that cause climate change now have a sufficient track record to
   provide potential models or lessons for national and even international
   action. In comparison, the state's efforts on climate change adaptation,
   although multifaceted, are less well developed and thus far have focused
   largely on information sharing, impact assessments, and planning. Still,
   adaptation could advance more quickly in California than in many other
   regions, given relatively high public awareness and concern, extensive
   scientific information, a strong tradition of local and regional
   planning, and some enabling policies and institutions. Much more
   political support and sufficient financing will have to be mustered at
   state and local levels to enable new projects and initiatives to cope
   with sea level rise, water management, and ecosystem adaptation, not to
   mention public health and other key areas of concern. Even so,
   California's initial efforts to adapt to unavoidable changes in climate
   may offer insights for other governments that will, inevitably, need to
   fashion their own adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Future changes in global warming potentials under representative
   concentration pathways},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Global warming potentials (GWPs) are the metrics currently used to
   compare emissions of different greenhouse gases under the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change. Future changes in greenhouse gas
   concentrations will alter GWPs because the radiative efficiencies of
   marginal changes in CO2, CH4 and N2O depend on their background
   concentrations, the removal of CO2 is influenced by climate-carbon cycle
   feedbacks, and atmospheric residence times of CH4 and N2O also depend on
   ambient temperature and other environmental changes. We calculated the
   currently foreseeable future changes in the absolute GWP of CO2, which
   acts as the denominator for the calculation of all GWPs, and
   specifically the GWPs of CH4 and N2O, along four representative
   concentration pathways (RCPs) up to the year 2100. We find that the
   absolute GWP of CO2 decreases under all RCPs, although for longer time
   horizons this decrease is smaller than for short time horizons due to
   increased climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. The 100-year GWP of CH4 would
   increase up to 20\% under the lowest RCP by 2100 but would decrease by
   up to 10\% by mid-century under the highest RCP. The 100-year GWP of N2O
   would increase by more than 30\% by 2100 under the highest RCP but would
   vary by less than 10\% under other scenarios. These changes are not
   negligible but are mostly smaller than the changes that would result
   from choosing a different time horizon for GWPs, or from choosing
   altogether different metrics for comparing greenhouse gas emissions,
   such as global temperature change potentials.},

Abstract = {International agreements and policies on climate change urge for a
   drastic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent a
   temperature rise above 2 degrees C at the end of the century.
   Determination of the product carbon footprint (CF), identifying carbon
   hotspots and examining ways for CF reduction is an essential step
   towards mitigation actions. Viticulture and winemaking are very
   important for the economy of Mediterranean regions, especially for the
   sustainability of rural areas. To determine the CF for wine, the Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was adopted with system boundaries from
   vineyard to market. Input data were collected from 20 vineyards on the
   island of Cyprus, where the indigenous Xynisteri variety is cultivated
   and from an SME winery that uses the grapes to produce wine. The winery
   CF was 99,586 kg CO2-eq for 76,000 bottles produced (1.31 kg/0.75 L
   bottle). The uncertainty factor was determined to be +/- 50\%, which was
   considered adequate for the methodology followed. The share of
   electrical energy was 46\%, of packaging 18\% and of the vineyard 16\%.
   Fuel (transportation and heating), as well as waste management (solid
   and wastewater) contributed 10\% each to the CF. There is potential for
   mitigation of the CF by replacing the bottles currently used by lighter
   ones, lowering the energy use and reusing a part of the solid waste as
   fertilizer. Research towards eco-innovation of viticulture/winemaking is
   essential for reducing the footprint of the sector to promote
   sustainable wine production.},

Abstract = {Research infrastructures play a key role in launching a new generation
   of integrated long-term, geographically distributed observation
   programmes designed to monitor climate change, better understand its
   impacts on global ecosystems, and evaluate possible mitigation and
   adaptation strategies. The pan-European Integrated Carbon Observation
   System combines carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG; CO2, CH4, N2O, H2O)
   observations within the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems and oceans.
   High-precision measurements are obtained using standardised
   methodologies, are centrally processed and openly available in a
   traceable and verifiable fashion in combination with detailed metadata.
   The Integrated Carbon Observation System ecosystem station network aims
   to sample climate and land-cover variability across Europe. In addition
   to GHG flux measurements, a large set of complementary data (including
   management practices, vegetation and soil characteristics) is collected
   to support the interpretation, spatial upscaling and modelling of
   observed ecosystem carbon and GHG dynamics. The applied sampling design
   was developed and formulated in protocols by the scientific community,
   representing a trade-off between an ideal dataset and practical
   feasibility. The use of open-access, high-quality and multi-level data
   products by different user communities is crucial for the Integrated
   Carbon Observation System in order to achieve its scientific potential
   and societal value.},

Abstract = {Regulations on greenhouse gas emissions within the maritime sector are
   possible, and some are in progress, using the tools of both
   international treaty law and federal regulations. Under the United
   Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), port and coastal States
   have jurisdiction over all ships entering their waters and thus have the
   unique ability to put efficient mitigation strategies in place, ranging
   from the inexpensive mandatory reduction in vessel speed to the more
   expensive commitment of installing shore-side electricity or
   scrubbing/sequestration equipment. These efforts should be financially
   supported by federal grants to avoid the race to the bottom. On a more
   global scale, LOSC Article 213 may contain greenhouse gas emissions
   within its definition of pollution. Annex VI of the International
   Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973 (MARPOL)
   is more directly on point for pollution control and is thus the more
   viable mechanism. Under MARPOL Annex VI, the International Maritime
   Organization (IMO) has made progress towards determining the feasibility
   of multiple technological, operational, and market-based approaches to
   regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including reforms in design, fuel,
   and operation. Despite this progress, the IMO must now take action and
   incorporate these approaches into MARPOL Annex VI to allow party nations
   to enforce them within their waters. Alternatively, the implementation
   of these approaches may be forced by a global cap-and-trade scheme
   resulting from the negotiations conducted under the auspices of the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Assigning these
   emissions to the flag State as a form of punishment for its cooperation
   in helping its flagged vessels avoid current regulation is suggested;
   however, creating a virtual country for the marine shipping industry is
   the more politically attractive option. On a federal front, the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made progress in tightening
   the the regulations in section 213 of the Clean Air Act (CA) governing
   marine vessels. These improvements, combined with the recent success of
   the designation of U. S. waters as a SOx Emission Control Area, will
   have substantial health and climate change-related benefits. However,
   carbon dioxide emissions for marine vessels remain unregulated, as well
   as, for the most part, category 1 and 2 engines. The EPA needs to
   continue to promulgate additional standards under CA section 213 to fill
   in these gaps.},

Title = {Regional Climate Impacts of Stabilizing Global Warming at 1.5 K Using

Abstract = {The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2K
   above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit global
   warming to 1.5K, in order to avert dangerous climate change. However,
   current greenhouse gas emissions targets are more compatible with
   scenarios exhibiting end-of-century global warming of 2.6-3.1K, in clear
   contradiction to the 1.5K target. In this study, we use a global climate
   model to investigate the climatic impacts of using solar geoengineering
   by stratospheric aerosol injection to stabilize global-mean temperature
   at 1.5K for the duration of the 21st century against three scenarios
   spanning the range of plausible greenhouse gas mitigation pathways
   (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). In addition to stabilizing global mean
   temperature and offsetting both Arctic sea-ice loss and thermosteric
   sea-level rise, we find that solar geoengineering could effectively
   counteract enhancements to the frequency of extreme storms in the North
   Atlantic and heatwaves in Europe, but would be less effective at
   counteracting hydrological changes in the Amazon basin and North
   Atlantic storm track displacement. In summary, solar geoengineering may
   reduce global mean impacts but is an imperfect solution at the regional
   level, where the effects of climate change are experienced. Our results
   should galvanize research into the regionality of climate responses to
   solar geoengineering.},

Title = {Ruminant contribution to enteric methane emissions and possible
   mitigation strategies in the Southern Africa Development Community
   region},

Abstract = {The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region is not a major
   emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG). However, Sub-Saharan Africa is
   considered a potential future hotspot for GHG emissions because of its
   large livestock population dispersed across large arid lands, coupled
   with the inherent low digestible feeds in the region and consequently
   low productivity of livestock. In SADC, climate change is predicted to
   increase temperatures further reducing agricultural productivity.
   Therefore, there is incentive to reduce agriculture's contribution to
   GHG emissions in the SADC region. Ruminant production, a mainstay of
   rural economy, is predicted to decrease because of diminished grazing
   due to reduced rainfall and feed quality. However, ruminants' enteric
   methane (CH4) production contributes to GHG emissions. This review
   explores strategies for the SADC region to reduce CH4 by ruminants. As
   methanogenesis is an outcome of microbial activity, potential
   opportunities include selecting animals with inherent low CH4
   production; altering ruminal microbial populations to those that do not
   yield CH4; enhancing feed digestibility by feeding additives which
   improve diet quality and alter the ruminal microbiome and using specific
   forages such as seaweed or duckweed that contain plant secondary
   metabolites that may decrease methanogen populations or methanogenesis.
   These strategies are considered in terms of their potential magnitude of
   CH4 mitigation, the practicality for their implementation in the SADC
   region and their suitability to be included in the grazing-based
   livestock industries in the SADC region.},

Title = {Beyond 1.5 degrees C: vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies for
   Caribbean Small Island Developing States},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {2341-2353},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global warming of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels and a
   commensurate increase in global greenhouse gas emissions pose an
   unprecedented danger to human settlements, livelihoods and the
   sustainable development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), yet
   these challenges present tremendous opportunities to rethink development
   pathways. The paper has two objectives. One is to critically review
   present vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies employed by the state,
   private sector, non-governmental organisations, community-based
   organisations and households. The other is to discuss vulnerabilities
   and identify adaptation and resiliency strategies which are considered
   most applicable beyond the 1.5 degrees C limit. The Caribbean Region is
   the focus of the paper. A key finding of the paper is that temperature
   change above the 1.5 degrees C limit set by the Paris Conference of the
   Parties will make the natural and human systems of SIDS even more highly
   vulnerable than they are already. Another finding is that Caribbean
   states have implemented various innovative climate change adaptation
   strategies, but their relevance should the 1.5 degrees C target be
   exceeded, requires further exploration. The paper is useful to
   policymakers, decision-makers and finance agencies in search of
   practical solutions to avert the implications for Caribbean settlements,
   economies and ecosystems should the temperature warming exceed 1.5
   degrees C.},

Abstract = {After briefly reviewing America's Energy Policy laid out by the Obama
   Administration, we outline how a Global Carbon Observing System designed
   to monitor Carbon from space can provide the necessary data and tools to
   equip decision makers with the knowledge necessary to formulate
   effective energy use and practices policy. To stabilize greenhouse gas
   emissions in the atmosphere in a manner that it does not interfere with
   the Earth's climate system (which is one of the goals of United Nations
   Framework for Convention on Climate Change) requires vastly improved
   prediction of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations.
   This in turn requires a robust understanding of the carbon exchange
   mechanisms between atmosphere, land, and oceans and a clear
   understanding of the sources and sinks (i.e. uptake and storage) of
   CO(2). We discuss how the Carbon Observing System from space aids in
   better understanding of the connection between the carbon cycle and
   climate change and provides more accurate predictions of atmospheric
   CO(2) concentration. It also enables implementation of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) mitigation policies such as cap and trade programs, international
   climate treaties, as well as formulation of effective energy use
   policies.},

Title = {Experimentation of Mitigation Strategies to Contrast the Urban Heat
   Island Effect: A Case Study of an Industrial District in Italy to
   Implement Environmental Codes},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The European goals to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 40\% by 2030 and
   reach carbon neutrality by 2050 cannot ignore the building sector, that
   accounts for 27\% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In the context of
   the sustainable development goals, it is a key point to consider the
   reduction of the heat island effect in the urban environment.
   Considering this background and the proven absence of the clear
   promotion of urban mitigation measures, the research aims at
   investigating the influence on several micro-climate parameters of
   different retrofitting strategies at the building level (green facades)
   and the cooling strategies at the urban scale (e.g., cool pavements,
   trees). As a case study, the application of these measures in an
   industrial district located in Italy is evaluated. ENVI-met software was
   adopted to perform the outdoor environmental simulations, in order to
   assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies proposed,
   considering both the whole district and a portion, focusing on urban
   canyons. Cool pavements proved to be the most promising strategy to both
   reduce the air temperature and increase the relative humidity. Slighter
   effects on environmental conditions can be achieved by planting trees
   and installing green walls that, by contrast, significantly affect the
   mean radiant temperature and buildings' surface temperatures,
   respectively.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, can
   cause severe global climatic changes, which may include an increase in
   the global temperature, rise of the sea level, increase in wildfire,
   floods, and storms, in addition to changes in the amount of rain and
   snow. The global mitigation strategies that can be envisioned to reduce
   the release of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere include
   retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient systems, increasing
   the dependency on renewable energy sources in lieu of fossil fuels,
   increasing the use of sustainable transportation systems that rely on
   electricity and biofuels, and adopting globally more sustainable uses of
   land and forests. To reduce global climatic changes, the excess amount
   of carbon dioxide in the environment needs to be captured and stored in
   deep underground sedimentary reservoirs. The sedimentary reservoirs that
   contain water in the rock matrix provide a more secure CO2 sequestration
   medium. The injection of carbon dioxide causes a huge increase in the
   reservoir pore pressure and provokes the subsequent ground uplift. The
   excessive increase in pore pressure may also cause leakage of carbon
   dioxide into the potable water layers and to the atmosphere, thus
   leading to severe global climatic changes. In order to maintain the
   integrity of the sequestration process, it is crucial to inject a safe
   quantity of carbon dioxide into the sequestration site. Accordingly, the
   injection period and the safe values of injection parameters, like flow
   rate and injection pressure, need to be calculated a priori to ensure
   that the stored carbon dioxide will not leak into the atmosphere and
   jeopardize the climate mitigation strategy. To model carbon dioxide
   injection in reservoirs having a base fluid, such as water, one has to
   perform a two-phase flow modeling for both the injected and base fluids.
   In the present investigation, carbon dioxide is injected into Biyadh
   reservoir, wherein the two-phase flow through the reservoir structure is
   taken into account. This investigation aims to estimate the safe
   parameter values for carbon dioxide injection into the Biyadh reservoir,
   in order to avoid leakage of carbon dioxide through the caprock. In this
   context, the two cases of a fractured and non-fractured caprock are
   considered. To ensure a safe sequestration mechanism, the coupled
   reservoir stability analysis is performed to estimate the safe values of
   the injection parameters, thus furnishing data for a reliable global
   climate change mitigation strategy. The obtained results demonstrated
   that the injection of carbon dioxide has caused a maximum pore pressure
   increase of 25MPa and a ground uplift of 35mm.},

Title = {Decision making under catastrophic risk and learning: the case of the
   possible collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {193-209},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A collapse of the West-Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) would cause a sea
   level rise of 5-6 m, perhaps even within 100 years, with catastrophic
   consequences. The probability of such a collapse is small but increasing
   with the rise of the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas and
   the resulting climate change. This paper investigates how the potential
   collapse of the WAIS affects the optimal rate of greenhouse gas emission
   control. We design a decision and learning tree in which decision are
   made about emission reduction at regular intervals: the decision makers
   (who act as social planners) have to decide whether to implement the
   environmental or not (keeping then the flexibility to act later). By
   investing in the environmental policy, they determine optimally the date
   of the optimal emission reduction. At the same time, they receive new
   information on the probability of a WAIS collapse and the severity of
   its impacts. The probability of a WAIS collapse is endogenous and
   contingent on greenhouse gas concentrations. We solve this optimisation
   problem by backward induction. We find that a potential WAIS collapse
   substantially bring the date of the optimal emission reduction forward
   and increases its amount if the probability is high enough (a
   probability of 1\% per year for the worst case), if the impacts are high
   enough (a worst case damage of 10\% of GDP for a 3 degrees C warming) or
   if the decision maker is risk averse enough (for example a social damage
   due to pollution equal to 1\% GDP for an atmospheric temperature of 3
   degrees C). We also find that, as soon as a WAIS collapse is a foregone
   fact, emission reduction falls to free up resource to prepare for
   adapting to the inevitable. By contrast, adaptation (such as building
   dikes along the coast) postpones policy intervention because that
   strategy reduces the risk of catastrophic damages.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is already apparent and will have
   significant, ongoing impacts on Australian fishes and their habitats.
   Even with immediate actions to reduce greenhouse gases, there will be
   sustained environmental changes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider
   appropriate adaptations to minimise detrimental impacts for both fishes
   and the human populations that utilise them. Climate change will have a
   range of direct effects on the physiology, fitness, and survivorship of
   Australia's marine, estuarine and freshwater fishes, but also indirect
   effects via habitat degradation and changes to ecosystems. Effects will
   differ across populations, species and ecosystems, with some impacts
   being complex and causing unexpected outcomes. The range of adaptation
   options and necessary levels of intervention to maintain populations and
   ecosystem function will largely depend on the vulnerability of species
   and habitats. Climate change will also have an impact on people who
   depend on fishes for food or livelihoods; adapting to a new climate
   regime will mean trade-offs between biological assets and socioeconomic
   drivers. Models can be used to help predict trends and set priorities;
   however, they must be based on the best available science and data, and
   include fisheries, environmental, socioeconomic and political layers to
   support management actions for adaptation.},

Abstract = {Most sewers in developing countries are combined sewers which receive
   stormwater and effluent from septic tanks or cesspools of households and
   buildings. Although the wastewater strength in these sewers is usually
   lower than those in developed countries, due to improper construction
   and maintenance, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) could be relatively
   long and resulting considerable greenhouse gas (GHG) production. This
   study proposed an empirical model to predict the quantity of methane
   production in gravity-flow sewers based on relevant parameters such as
   surface area to volume ratio (A/V) of sewer, hydraulic retention time
   (HRT) and wastewater temperature. The model was developed from field
   survey data of gravity-flow sewers located in a peri-urban area, central
   Thailand and validated with field data of a sewer system of the Gold
   Coast area, Queensland, Australia. Application of this model to improve
   construction and maintenance of gravity-flow sewers to minimize GHG
   production and reduce global warming is presented.},

Abstract = {There are two responses to global climate change. First, mitigation,
   which actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester or store
   carbon in the short-term, and make development choices that will lead to
   low emissions in the long-term. Second, adaptation, which involves
   adjustments in natural or human systems and behaviours that reduce the
   risks posed by climate change to people's lives and livelihoods. While
   the two are conceptually distinct, in practice they are Very much
   interdependent, and both are equally urgent from I healthy population
   perspective. To define the policies to mitigate and to adapt to global
   climate change, data and information at all scales are the basic
   requirement for both developed and developing countries. However, as
   compared to mitigation, adaptation is all immediate concern for
   low-income Countries and for small islands states, where the reduction
   Of the emissions from greenhouse gases is not among their priorities.
   Adaptation is also highly location specific and the required ground data
   to assess the impacts of climate change on human health are not
   available. Climate data at high spatial resolution can be derived by
   various downscaling methods using historical and real-time
   meteorological observations but, particularly in low-income countries,
   the outputs are limited by the lack of ground data at the local level.
   In many of these countries, a negative trend ill the number of
   meteorological stations as compared as to before 2000 is evident, while
   remotely-sensed imagery becomes more and more available at high spatial
   and temporal resolution. The final consequence is that climate change
   policy options in the developing world are greatly jeopardized.},

Abstract = {Regional saline aquifers offer the greatest potential for very
   large-scale underground CO2 storage as a means of mitigating greenhouse
   gas emissions. Their dynamic storage capacity, in terms of induced
   increases in formation pressure, will limit the rate at which CO2 can be
   injected and may ultimately limit the amount of CO that can be stored.
   Generic flow models were generated to examine the effects on pressure
   evolution of various reservoir parameters (dimensions, permeability,
   porosity, presence and nature of flow barriers). CO2 injection involves
   dominantly hydrogeological (single-phase flow) processes in much of the
   reservoir and surrounding adjacent strata, with additional two-phase
   flow effects around the CO2 plume itself. Large, thick aquifers with no
   significant flow barriers can accept high injection rates (c. 10 million
   tonnes of CO2 per year) without undue pressure effects. However, flow
   barriers, such as faults, increase induced pressures considerably; for
   reservoirs with such features, careful site characterization and
   operational planning will be required for large storage projects. The
   principles established from the generic modelling were applied to a real
   aquifer storage operation at Sleipner in the North Sea. Here, CO2 is
   being injected into the Utsira Sand, a large relatively homogeneous
   reservoir. Modelling indicates that pressure increase should be
   negligible. In fact, observed wellhead pressures do show a small rise,
   but this can be attributed to temperature changes in the fluid column in
   the wellbore. Pressure changes in the reservoir are likely to be very
   small.},

Title = {Potential management practices of saltwater intrusion impacts on soil
   health and water quality: a review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1327-1343},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Several studies have documented the multifaceted impacts of climate
   change and variability on agricultural and environmental sustainability,
   and social and economic development. Climate change and variability
   contribute to increased warmer conditions, increased frequency of heavy
   rain that accounts for an increasing proportion of total rainfall,
   extreme weather characterized by spatially variable cycles of drought
   and wetness, increased frequency of tropical storms/hurricanes,
   increased frequency of storm surges, and accelerated rate of sea-level
   rise (SLR). As SLR continues, it is expected that salinity due to
   saltwater intrusion (SWI) will impact soil health and agricultural
   production. As such, the significant threats of salinity necessitate
   more work to be done to better understand its impact on soil health and
   associated functional ecosystem processes. This is of even greater
   importance in areas such as South Florida where the surface and
   groundwater resources are hydrologically connected due to the shallow
   and highly permeable limestone soils. A better understanding of the
   impacts of salinity due to SWI on soil health is critical to design
   effective mitigation strategies. Healthy soil has multifaceted benefits
   to enhance agricultural productivity, i.e. regulates the flow of water;
   serves as a source and sink of nutrients; minimizes greenhouse gas
   emissions and provides optimal biological and chemical conditions for
   the transformation of nutrients into plant-available forms. Improved
   understanding of the processes and impacts of SWI on soil health will
   assist in guiding management decisions and policies to mitigate the
   impacts of SWI and salinity on agricultural soils. This review paper
   provides a comprehensive overview of the impacts of SWI and soil
   salinity on agricultural soil health and water quality.},

Title = {Seasonal and Long-Term Changes to Pavement Life Caused by Rising

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2673},
Number = {6},
Pages = {267-278},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pavements are vulnerable to reduced life with climate-change-induced
   temperature rise. Greenhouse gas emissions have caused an increase in
   global temperatures since the mid-20th century and the warming is
   projected to accelerate. Many studies have characterized this risk with
   a top-down approach in which climate-change scenarios are chosen and
   applied to predict pavement-life reduction. This approach is useful in
   identifying possible pavement futures but may miss short-term or
   seasonal pavement-response trends that are essential for adaptation
   planning. A bottom-up approach focuses on a pavement's response to
   incremental temperature change resulting in a more complete
   understanding of temperature-induced pavement damage. In this study, a
   hybrid bottom-up/top-down approach was used to quantify the impact of
   changing pavement seasons and temperatures on pavement life with
   incremental temperature rise from 0 to 5 degrees C at a site in coastal
   New Hampshire. Changes in season length, seasonal average temperatures,
   and temperature-dependent resilient modulus were used in layered-elastic
   analysis to simulate the pavement's response to temperature rise.
   Projected temperature rise from downscaled global climate models was
   then superimposed on the results to determine the timing of the effects.
   The winter pavement season is projected to end by mid-century, replaced
   by a lengthening fall season. Seasonal pavement damage, currently
   dominated by the late spring and summer seasons, is projected to be
   distributed more evenly throughout the year as temperatures rise. A 7\%
   to 32\% increase in the asphalt-layer thickness is recommended to
   protect the base and subgrade with rising temperatures from early
   century to late-mid-century.},

Title = {Blue carbon drawdown by restored mangrove forests improves with age},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {306},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, is
   increasingly used as a management tool to mitigate climate change by
   removing and sequestering atmospheric carbon in the ground. However,
   estimates of carbon-offset potential are currently based on data from
   natural mangrove forests, potentially leading to overestimating the
   carbon-offset potential from restored mangroves. Here, in the first
   study of its kind, we utilise Pb-210 sediment age-dating techniques and
   greenhouse gas flux measures to estimate blue carbon additionality in
   restored mangrove forests, ranging from 13 to 35 years old. As expected,
   mangrove age had a significant effect on carbon additionality and carbon
   accretion rate, with the older mangrove stands (17 and 35 years old)
   holding double the total carbon stocks (aboveground + soil stocks;
   similar to 115 tonnes C ha- (1)) and double the soil sequestration rates
   (similar to 3 tonnes C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than the youngest mangrove stand
   (13 years old). Although soil carbon stocks increased with mangrove age,
   the aboveground plant stocks were highest in the 17-year-old stand.
   Mangrove age also had a significant effect on soil carbon fluxes, with
   the older mangroves (>= 17 years) releasing one-fourth of the CH4
   emissions, but double the CO2 flux compared to young stands. Our study
   suggests that the carbon sink capacity of restored mangrove forests
   increases with age, but stabilises once they mature (e.g., > 17 years).
   This means that by using carbon sequestration and emissions from natural
   forests, mangrove restoration projects may be overestimating their
   carbon sequestration potential.},

Title = {An Injury to the Inheritance: Locating an Affirmative Obligation to
   Climate Adaptation in the Law of Waste},
Journal = {COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF LAW AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {As global temperatures continue to rise, most climate policy
   conversations have focused on mitigation measures, aimed at reducing the
   proliferation of greenhouse gases and curbing the rise in temperatures.
   Discussions, especially in legal literature, about climate adaptation
   measures-those intended to, for example, prepare for rising sea levels
   or increasing incidence of extreme weather events-have generally focused
   on the powers and responsibilities of government actors. Private
   citizens too, however, may also have a duty to prepare for climate
   change.
   The law of waste is a longstanding doctrine under which holders of a
   current possessory interest in real property, such as tenants or
   mortgagors, bear certain responsibilities towards holders of concurrent
   or future interests, such as lessors or mortgagees. This Note argues
   that a subset of the law of waste, called permissive waste, may be read
   to impose a duty to affirmatively pursue climate adaptation measures on
   tenants and other similarly-situated individuals. Part II provides
   background information on current efforts to find a legal basis for a
   duty to pursue climate adaptation. Part III examines the history of the
   law of waste, with particular attention to the concept of permissive
   waste. Parts IV and V outline how the law of waste could be applied to
   the problem of climate adaptation, exploring the necessary conditions
   for such a claim to be made as well as the uses and limitations of using
   the law of waste in this fashion.},

Title = {Investigating the climate impacts of urbanization and the potential for
   cool roofs to counter future climate change in Southern California},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The climate warming effects of accelerated urbanization along with
   projected global climate change raise an urgent need for sustainable
   mitigation and adaptation strategies to cool urban climates. Our
   modeling results show that historical urbanization in the Los Angeles
   and San Diego metropolitan areas has increased daytime urban air
   temperature by 1.3 degrees C, in part due to a weakening of the onshore
   sea breeze circulation. We find that metropolis-wide adoption of cool
   roofs can meaningfully offset this daytime warming, reducing
   temperatures by 0.9 degrees C relative to a case without cool roofs.
   Residential cool roofs were responsible for 67\% of the cooling.
   Nocturnal temperature increases of 3.1 degrees C from urbanization were
   larger than daytime warming, while nocturnal temperature reductions from
   cool roofs of 0.5 degrees C were weaker than corresponding daytime
   reductions. We further show that cool roof deployment could partially
   counter the local impacts of global climate change in the Los Angeles
   metropolitan area. Assuming a scenario in which there are dramatic
   decreases in greenhouse gas emissions in the 21st century (RCP2.6),
   mid-and end-of-century temperature increases from global change relative
   to current climate are similarly reduced by cool roofs from 1.4 degrees
   C to 0.6 degrees C. Assuming a scenario with continued emissions
   increases throughout the century (RCP8.5), mid-century warming is
   significantly reduced by cool roofs from 2.0 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C.
   The end-century warming, however, is significantly offset only in small
   localized areas containing mostly industrial/commercial buildings where
   cool roofs with the highest albedo are adopted. We conclude that
   metropolis-wide adoption of cool roofs can play an important role in
   mitigating the urban heat island effect, and offsetting near-term local
   warming from global climate change. Global-scale reductions in
   greenhouse gas emissions are the only way of avoiding long-term warming,
   however. We further suggest that both climate mitigation and adaptation
   can be pursued simultaneously using `cool photovoltaics'.},

Title = {Characterizing uncertainty in climate impact projections: a case study

Abstract = {Projections of climate change impacts on living resources are being
   conducted frequently, and the goal is often to inform policy. Species
   projections will be more useful if uncertainty is effectively
   quantified. However, few studies have comprehensively characterized the
   projection uncertainty arising from greenhouse gas scenarios, Earth
   system models (ESMs), and both structural and parameter uncertainty in
   species distribution modelling. Here, we conducted 8964 unique 21st
   century projections for shifts in suitable habitat for seven
   economically important marine species including American lobster,
   Pacific halibut, Pacific ocean perch, and summer flounder. For all
   species, both the ESM used to simulate future temperatures and the niche
   modelling approach used to represent species distributions were
   important sources of uncertainty, while variation associated with
   parameter values in niche models was minor. Greenhouse gas emissions
   scenario contributed to uncertainty for projections at the century
   scale. The characteristics of projection uncertainty differed among
   species and also varied spatially, which underscores the need for
   improved multi-model approaches with a suite of ESMs and niche models
   forming the basis for uncertainty around projected impacts. Ensemble
   projections show the potential for major shifts in future distributions.
   Therefore, rigorous future projections are important for informing
   climate adaptation efforts.},

Title = {Effects of organic matter amendments on net primary productivity and
   greenhouse gas emissions in annual grasslands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Most of the world's grasslands are managed for livestock production. A
   critical component of the long-term sustainability and profitability of
   rangelands (e. g., grazed grassland ecosystems) is the maintenance of
   plant production. Amending grassland soils with organic waste has been
   proposed as a means to increase net primary productivity (NPP) and
   ecosystem carbon (C) storage, while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
   from waste management. Few studies have evaluated the effects of
   amendments on the C balance and greenhouse gas dynamics of grasslands.
   We used field manipulations replicated within and across two rangelands
   (a valley grassland and a coastal grassland) to determine the effects of
   a single application of composted green waste amendments on NPP and
   greenhouse gas emissions over three years. Amendments elevated total
   soil respiration by 18\% +/- 4\% at both sites but had no effect on
   nitrous oxide or methane emissions. Carbon losses were significantly
   offset by greater and sustained plant production. Amendments stimulated
   both above-and belowground NPP by 2.1 +/- 0.8 Mg C/ha to 4.7 +/- 0.7 Mg
   C/ha (mean +/- SE) over the three-year study period. Net ecosystem C
   storage increased by 25-70\% without including the direct addition of
   compost C. The estimated magnitude of net ecosystem C storage was
   sensitive to estimates of heterotrophic soil respiration but was greater
   than controls in five out of six fields that received amendments. The
   sixth plot was the only one that exhibited lower soil moisture than the
   control, suggesting an important role of water limitation in these
   seasonally dry ecosystems. Treatment effects persisted over the course
   of the study, which were likely derived from increased water-holding
   capacity in most plots, and slow-release fertilization from compost
   decomposition. We conclude that a single application of composted
   organic matter can significantly increase grassland C storage, and that
   effects of a single application are likely to carry over in time.},

Abstract = {Cities are exposed more and more to climate change from greenhouse gas
   induced radiative forcing, and localized effects from urbanization such
   as the urban heat island. Urban land covers as the biophysical state of
   the earth's surface and immediate subsurface are sources and sinks for
   most of the material and energy movements and interactions between the
   geosphere and biosphere. Climate change is considered to be the biggest
   environmental threat in the future in the South-Eastern part of Europe.
   The aim of this paper is to investigate the influences of urban growth
   on urban thermal environment as well as the relationships of thermal
   characteristics to other biophysical parameters in Bucharest
   metropolitan area of Romania based on time series MODIS Terra/Aqua and
   IKONOS data acquired during 2000-2014 periods. Land Surface Temperature
   (LST) is a key variable for studying urban land surface processes and
   surface atmosphere interactions, being a crucial component in the study
   of the surface energy and water budgets. Urbanization created an evolved
   inverse relationship between impervious and vegetation coverage, and
   brought about new LST patterns because of LST's correlations with both
   impervious and vegetation coverage. City thermal environment risk
   management strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change must
   propose efficient plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
   cool the city through changes in the built environment, land use, and
   transportation.},

Title = {Methane Emissions from Ruminants in Australia: Mitigation Potential and
   Applicability of Mitigation Strategies},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. It is 80-times more effective at
   heating the earth than carbon dioxide over the first 20 years following
   release into the atmosphere. Ruminant animals have diverse microbial
   populations in their stomachs that employ anaerobic fermentation to
   digest feed. Methane is belched into the atmosphere as a by-product of
   the digestive process. This gut, or enteric methane, primarily from
   cattle, but also sheep and goats, contributes 30\% of the methane
   released into the earth's atmosphere each day, and is more than any
   other single methane source. A major reduction in methane emissions from
   ruminants is crucial to preserve ecosystems on the planet. Various
   strategies to reduce enteric methane emissions in farm operations are
   reviewed to quantify their mitigation potential, determine their impact
   on animal productivity and likelihood of adoption. Two feed supplements,
   a commercial product, 3-NOP (Bovaer(R)), and the seaweed, Asparagopsis,
   can reduce methane emissions by 40+\% and 90\%, respectively, with
   associated increases in animal productivity and no adverse effects on
   animal health or product quality. The rumen microbial population can
   also be changed to provide long-term intergenerational reduction in
   methane emissions, if treated herds remain isolated from non-treated
   animals.
   Anthropomorphic greenhouse gases are raising the temperature of the
   earth and threatening ecosystems. Since 1950 atmospheric carbon dioxide
   has increased 28\%, while methane has increased 70\%. Methane, over the
   first 20 years after release, has 80-times more warming potential as a
   greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Enteric methane from microbial
   fermentation of plant material by ruminants contributes 30\% of methane
   released into the atmosphere, which is more than any other single
   source. Numerous strategies were reviewed to quantify their methane
   mitigation potential, their impact on animal productivity and their
   likelihood of adoption. The supplements, 3-nitrooxypropanol and the
   seaweed, Asparagopsis, reduced methane emissions by 40+\% and 90\%,
   respectively, with increases in animal productivity and small effects on
   animal health or product quality. Manipulation of the rumen microbial
   population can potentially provide intergenerational reduction in
   methane emissions, if treated animals remain isolated. Genetic
   selection, vaccination, grape marc, nitrate or biochar reduced methane
   emissions by 10\% or less. Best management practices and cattle browsing
   legumes, Desmanthus or Leucaena species, result in small levels of
   methane mitigation and improved animal productivity. Feeding large
   amounts daily of ground wheat reduced methane emissions by around 35\%
   in dairy cows but was not sustained over time.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {267},

Abstract = {The rapidly growing urban population, along with the increasing urban
   energy needs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, poses a serious threat
   to the global climate. Local, regional, and global climatic condi-tions
   synergistically interact and affect urban energy performance and thermal
   comfort. The combined impact of such local, regional and global climatic
   change on the buildings' thermal performance has never been studied. In
   the present study, the combined impact of urban overheating (UO) and
   heatwaves (HWs) on building thermal performance have been investigated
   by employing the urban building energy model (UBEM). Further, the
   sensitivity analyses were performed using various adaptive measures to
   evaluate the impact on cooling needs and indoor comfort. Under the
   synergistic impact of UO and HWs, the cool -ing penalties were recorded
   up to 650\%, the increase in mean indoor temperature was up to 5.8
   degrees C, and the deterioration in passive survivability was registered
   up to 31\%. Under the combined impact of various adaptive measures, the
   cooling savings were recorded up to 97\%, the drop in mean indoor
   temperature was up to 2.34 degrees C, and the improvement in passive
   survivability was up to 20\% during HWs. The present study might assist
   in revising the building codes to counteract the global climatic change
   and improve building resilience during extreme heat conditions. (c) 2022

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adaptation is the process of adjusting to climate change in order to
   moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities associated with it.
   Most adaptation strategies are designed to adjust to a new climate
   state. However, despite our best efforts to curtail greenhouse gas
   emissions, climate is likely to continue changing far into the future.
   Here, we show how considering rates of change affects the projected
   optimal adaptation strategy. We ground our discussion with an example of
   optimal investment in the face of continued sea-level rise, presenting a
   quantitative model that illustrates the interplay among physical and
   economic factors governing coastal development decisions such as rate of
   sea-level rise, land slope, discount rate, and depreciation rate. This
   model shows that the determination of optimal investment strategies
   depends on taking into account future rates of sea-level rise, as well
   as social and political constraints. This general approach also applies
   to the development of improved strategies to adapt to ongoing trends in
   temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables. Adaptation to
   some amount of change instead of adaptation to ongoing rates of change
   may produce inaccurate estimates of damages to the social systems and
   their ability to respond to external pressures.},

Title = {From Dichotomy to an Integrated Approach: Cities' Benefits of
   Integrating Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cities are facing impacts of climate change and encountering risks such
   as extreme weather events, while cities are also aiming to contribute to
   their mitigation goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   the differences in characteristics of climate change mitigation and
   adaptation have shown the possible reasons for a dichotomy in climate
   policy. This has motivated us to further look into whether cities could
   integrate their actions in climate change mitigation and adaptation in
   their planning and how they achieve benefits to overcome the dichotomy.
   To answer our research question, we have developed an analysis framework
   built on the endogenous risk theory to analyse how cities overcome the
   different characteristics to integrate their climate strategies and
   obtain benefits. The theory of endogenous risk involves seeing both
   climate change mitigation and adaptation as risk reduction strategies
   because both of them aim to reduce climate risks and can be carried out
   by actors who perceive such risks. Therefore, the actors will be more
   willing to integrate and implement both mitigation and adaptation
   policy. Our results show that mitigation and adaptation in cities are
   interlinked and that benefits of an integrated climate change policy
   exist. A list of entry points how cities overcome the dichotomy are also
   identified. Our research outcomes also provide a list of benefits
   identified by the cities in their integrated climate strategies and we
   call for more public disclosed data for future research and policy
   assessments.},

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {225-241},
Abstract = {In an era of climate change, adaptive strategies and coastal management
   actions are needed to support the interdependent goals of maintaining
   biological diversity, ecosystem health, and the well-being of
   communities. California is in the forefront of developing science-based
   planning elements and programs that support a more integrative and
   adaptive approach to address climate impacts, including the development
   of new tools such as the designation of marine protected areas.
   California's coastal cities and counties are developing Climate Action
   Plans (CAPs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The state has also
   completed the 2009 California Climate Adaptation Strategy that
   identifies goals and actions needed to better integrate scientific
   information into coastal planning. The article emphasizes the need to
   broaden the scope of local coastal plans to include new biodiversity
   protection and land-use elements that address the anticipated impacts
   from climate change on coastal ecosystems. A number of strategies to
   strengthen the connection between scientists, stakeholders, and local
   coastal planners are described in the article. In particular, science
   and scientists should play a crucial role in identifying coastal areas
   that may serve as ``climate-change refugia{''} where species hit the
   hardest by climate impacts are projected to relocate.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine the subject of justice as it relates to
   gender and climate change by focusing on two specific strategies,
   namely, the geoengineering strategy of ocean fertilization, and
   renewable energy as a means of mitigation (where mitigation is
   understood as the adoption of technologies and practices that aim to
   slow the rise of greenhouse gas emissions). My overarching argument is
   that iron fertilization geoengineering is not consistent with the
   feminist values of justice embedded in feminist standpoint theory and
   feminist contextual empiricism. Alternative mitigation strategies, on
   the other hand, go much further in meeting these objectives and virtues.},

   Implications, Mitigation, and Adaptations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Aquaculture continues to significantly expand its production, making it
   the fastest-growing food production sector globally. However, the
   sustainability of the sector is at stake due to the predicted effects of
   climate change that are not only a future but also a present reality. In
   this paper, we review the potential effects of climate change on
   aquaculture production and its implications on the sector's
   sustainability. Various elements of a changing climate, such as rising
   temperatures, sea-level rise, diseases and harmful algal blooms, changes
   in rainfall patterns, the uncertainty of external inputs supplies,
   changes in sea surface salinity, and severe climatic events have been
   discussed. Furthermore, several adaptation options have been presented
   as well as some gaps in existing knowledge that require further
   investigations. Overall, climate change effects and implications on
   aquaculture production sustainability are expected to be both negative
   and positive although, the negative effects outweigh the positive ones.
   Adapting to the predicted changes in the short-term while taking
   mitigation measures in the long-term could be the only way toward
   sustaining the sector's production. However, successful adaptation will
   depend on the adaptive capacity of the producers in different regions of
   the world.},

   policy},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {129},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {337-349},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent literature, the US Global Change Research Program's National
   Climate Assessment, and recent events, such as Hurricane Sandy,
   highlight the need to take better account of both storm surge and
   sea-level rise (SLR) in assessing coastal risks of climate change. This
   study combines three models-a tropical cyclone simulation model; a storm
   surge model; and a model for economic impact and adaptation-to estimate
   the joint effects of storm surge and SLR for the US coast through 2100.
   The model is tested using multiple SLR scenarios, including those
   incorporating estimates of dynamic ice-sheet melting, two global
   greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policy scenarios, and multiple general
   circulation model climate sensitivities. The results illustrate that a
   large area of coastal land and property is at risk of damage from storm
   surge today; that land area and economic value at risk expands over time
   as seas rise and as storms become more intense; that adaptation is a
   cost-effective response to this risk, but residual impacts remain after
   adaptation measures are in place; that incorporating site-specific
   episodic storm surge increases national damage estimates by a factor of
   two relative to SLR-only estimates, with greater impact on the East and
   Gulf coasts; and that mitigation of GHGs contributes to significant
   lessening of damages. For a mid-range climate-sensitivity scenario that
   incorporates dynamic ice sheet melting, the approach yields national
   estimates of the impacts of storm surge and SLR of \$990 billion through
   2100 (net of adaptation, cumulative undiscounted 2005\$); GHG mitigation
   policy reduces the impacts of the mid-range climate-sensitivity
   estimates by \$84 to \$100 billion.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Concerns over transport energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
   have lately prompted significant attention towards vehicle ownership
   patterns and the distributional implications of climate mitigation
   policies. This paper contributes to freight transport literature by
   examining how establishments can be meaningfully grouped using their
   fleet ownership pattern (size and composition) and how these segments
   vary in their freight travel pattern and CO2 emission levels. The
   analysis performed using an establishment-based freight survey dataset
   from Kerala, a coastal state in India, revealed five latent classes of
   fleet ownership. The determinants of freight transport emissions and the
   gross emitters in fleet segments are presented subsequently by analyzing
   how the establishment-level characteristics (employment, business age,
   industry sector, value density, and relative location) explain the
   variation in CO2 emissions. The study findings offer insights for
   designing effective carbon policy instruments and incentive schemes to
   regulate the establishment-level freight travel pattern and control
   transport emissions.},

Title = {Measuring and Monitoring Urban Impacts on Climate Change from Space},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As urban areas continue to expand and play a critical role as both
   contributors to climate change and hotspots of vulnerability to its
   effects, cities have become battlegrounds for climate change adaptation
   and mitigation. Large amounts of earth observations from space have been
   collected over the last five decades and while most of the measurements
   have not been designed specifically for monitoring urban areas, an
   increasing number of these observations is being used for understanding
   the growth rates of cities and their environmental impacts. Here we
   reviewed the existing tools available from satellite remote sensing to
   study urban contribution to climate change, which could be used for
   monitoring the progress of climate change mitigation strategies at the
   city level. We described earth observations that are suitable for
   measuring and monitoring urban population, extent, and structure; urban
   emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants; urban energy
   consumption; and extent, intensity, and effects on surrounding regions,
   including nearby water bodies, of urban heat islands. We compared the
   observations available and obtainable from space with the measurements
   desirable for monitoring. Despite considerable progress in monitoring
   urban extent, structure, heat island intensity, and air pollution from
   space, many limitations and uncertainties still need to be resolved. We
   emphasize that some important variables, such as population density and
   urban energy consumption, cannot be suitably measured from space with
   available observations.},

Abstract = {Improved constraints on carbon cycle responses to climate change are
   needed to inform mitigation policy, yet our understanding of how these
   responses may evolve after 2100 remains highly uncertain. Using the
   Community Earth System Model (v1.0), we quantified climate-carbon
   feedbacks from 1850 to 2300 for the Representative Concentration Pathway
   8.5 and its extension. In three simulations, land and ocean
   biogeochemical processes experienced the same trajectory of increasing
   atmospheric CO2. Each simulation had a different degree of radiative
   coupling for CO2 and other greenhouse gases and aerosols, enabling
   diagnosis of feedbacks. In a fully coupled simulation, global mean
   surface air temperature increased by 9.3K from 1850 to 2300, with 4.4K
   of this warming occurring after 2100. Excluding CO2, warming from other
   greenhouse gases and aerosols was 1.6K by 2300, near a 2K target needed
   to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
   Ocean contributions to the climate-carbon feedback increased
   considerably over time and exceeded contributions from land after 2100.
   The sensitivity of ocean carbon to climate change was found to be
   proportional to changes in ocean heat content, as a consequence of this
   heat modifying transport pathways for anthropogenic CO2 inflow and
   solubility of dissolved inorganic carbon. By 2300, climate change
   reduced cumulative ocean uptake by 330PgC, from 1410PgC to 1080PgC. Land
   fluxes similarly diverged over time, with climate change reducing stocks
   by 232PgC. Regional influence of climate change on carbon stocks was
   largest in the North Atlantic Ocean and tropical forests of South
   America. Our analysis suggests that after 2100, oceans may become as
   important as terrestrial ecosystems in regulating the magnitude of the
   climate-carbon feedback.},

Abstract = {The regional climate as it is now and in the future will put pressure on
   investments in sub-Saharan Africa in water resource management,
   fisheries, and other crop and livestock production systems. Changes in
   oceanic characteristics across the Atlantic Ocean will result in
   remarkable vulnerability of coastal ecology, littorals, and mangroves in
   the middle of the twenty-first century and beyond. In line with the
   countries' objectives of creating a green economy that allows reduced
   greenhouse gas emissions, improved resource efficiency, and prevention
   of biodiversity loss, we identify the most pressing needs for adaptation
   and the best adaptation choices that are also clean and affordable.
   According to empirical data from the field and customized model
   simulation designs, the cost of these adaptation measures will likely
   decrease and benefit sustainable green growth in agriculture, water
   resource management, and coastal ecosystems, as hydroclimatic hazards
   such as pluviometric and thermal extremes become more common in West
   Africa. Most of these adaptation options are local and need to be scaled
   up and operationalized for sustainable development. Governmental
   sovereign wealth funds, investments from the private sector, and funding
   from global climate funds can be used to operationalize these adaptation
   measures. Effective legislation, knowledge transfer, and pertinent
   collaborations are necessary for their success.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions from the global transportation of crude oil:
   Current status and mitigation potential},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Global crude-oil transportation contributes a significant portion of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the marine transportation sector. In
   this work, we first compile a detailed country-level global crude-oil
   transportation network in 2018 and estimate that the direct and
   well-to-hull GHG emissions related to crude transportation were 97 and
   109 million metric tons, respectively. Combining with the
   country-specific crude recovery GHG intensities, the consumption-based
   well-to-country-gate crude-oil GHG intensities are derived for
   individual countries, ranging from 2.99 to 27.32 g CO(2)eq/MJ, with a
   global crude-volume-weighted average of 8.67 g CO(2)eq/MJ. We then
   project the global crude transportation emissions at the regional level
   in 2050 under a static (no change) scenario (based on current ship
   energy efficiency) and a sustainable-development (SD) scenario (based on
   the International Energy Agency's projections of ship energy efficiency
   and penetration of alternative marine fuels). Results show that the
   global well-to-hull GHG emissions related to crude transportation would
   be 82 and 59 million metric tons in 2050 in the static and SD scenarios,
   respectively. To further evaluate the impact of potential fuel-switching
   on decarbonizing the crude oil transportation sector, we estimate the
   GHG emissions for 20 fuel/production options in 2050. We find that, in
   comparison to the static scenario, similar to 50\% reduction in global
   well-to-hull GHG emissions from crude transportation could be achieved
   under the SD scenario if green ammonia further replaces conventional
   ammonia. The methodology developed here can be applied to other
   commodities to estimate the emissions associated with their global
   marine transportation and to evaluate the potential emission mitigation
   options.},

Title = {Synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation in
   development Case studies of Amman, Jakarta, and Dar es Salaam},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-111},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how cities at
   different stages of development each subject to its own challenges in
   adapting to climate change can manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   Design/methodology/approach - Case studies are undertaken for three
   cities: Amman, Jakarta and Dar es Salaam, including determination of GHG
   emissions and analysis of climate change data (where available) for
   each.
   Findings - In Amman, the most climate-sensitive municipal service is
   water; Jordan is exceptionally dry, and nearly 15 per cent of all
   electricity consumption is by the water authority. Jakarta has already
   experienced extreme flooding. The climate vulnerabilities associated
   with sea-level rise are intensified by subsidence in parts of Jakarta.
   Alternating floods and droughts are climate impacts already experienced
   in Dar es Salaam. Droughts have impacted Tanzania's electricity
   infrastructure disrupting hydroelectricity production, requiring new
   natural gas infrastructure to maintain power, thereby increasing GHG
   emissions. Nonetheless, Dar es Salaam's GHG emissions at 0.56 t
   CO(2)e/cap are small compared to Amman and Jakarta at 3.66 and 4.92 t
   CO(2)e/cap., respectively.
   Originality/value - Synergist development strategies, addressing climate
   change mitigation and adaptation are suggested. In Amman an increased
   share of photovoltaic electricity production might be used for service
   provision, especially for energy needs surrounding water supply.
   Advanced slum upgrading in Jakarta could see relocation of the at-risk
   poor to safe areas with energy efficient homes connected to public
   transit and decentralized, community-based electricity generation. The
   focus in Dar es Salaam community-based waste-to-energy facilities would
   reduce climate change impacts and vulnerabilities while addressing
   energy poverty in poor communities.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-383},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We describe the global climate system context in which to interpret
   African environmental change to support planning and implementation of
   policymaking action at national, regional and continental scales, and to
   inform the debate between proponents of mitigation v. adaptation
   strategies in the face of climate change. We review recent advances and
   current challenges in African climate research and exploit our physical
   understanding of variability and trends to shape our outlook on future
   climate change. We classify the various mechanisms that have been
   proposed as relevant for understanding variations in African rainfall,
   emphasizing a ``tropospheric stabilization{''} mechanism that is of
   importance on interannual time scales as well as for the future response
   to warming oceans. Two patterns stand out in our analysis of twentieth
   century rainfall variability: a drying of the monsoon regions, related
   to warming of the tropical oceans, and variability related to the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation. The latest generation of climate models
   partly captures this recent continent-wide drying trend, attributing it
   to the combination of anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and greenhouse
   gases, the relative contribution of which is difficult to quantify with
   the existing model archive. The same climate models fail to reach a
   robust agreement regarding the twenty-first century outlook for African
   rainfall, in a future with increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing
   aerosol loadings. Such uncertainty underscores current limitations in
   our understanding of the global climate system that it is necessary to
   overcome if science is to support Africa in meeting its development
   goals.},

Title = {Implementing adaptive management into a climate change adaptation
   strategy for a drowning New England salt marsh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {270},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Due to climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, future
   conditions and impacts facing coastal habitats are unclear to coastal
   resource managers. Adaptive management strategies have become an
   important tactic to compensate for the unknown environmental conditions
   that coastal managers and restoration ecologists face. Adaptive
   management requires extensive planning and resources, which can act as
   barriers to achieve a successful project. These barriers also create
   challenges in incorporating adaptive management into climate change
   adaptation strategies. This case study describes and analyzes the Rhode
   Island Coastal Resources Management Council's approach to overcome these
   challenges to implement a successful adaptive management project to
   restore a drowning salt marsh using the climate change adaptation
   strategy, sediment enhancement, at Quonochontaug Pond in Charlestown,
   RI. Through effective communication and active stakeholder involvement,
   this project successfully incorporated interdisciplinary partner and
   stakeholder collaborations and developed an iterative learning strategy
   that highlights the adaptive management method.},

Abstract = {The United States Navy has a long record of responsible environmental
   stewardship covering many areas such as environmental planning,
   regulatory compliance, site clean-up, and protection of natural
   resources. The Navy is now beginning to appreciate the potentially
   devastating potential of a new set of environmental issues related to
   climate change. There is a growing recognition that the Navy will need
   to perform its national security mission in a changing global
   environment characterized by:
   Rising sea levels that threaten the viability of Navy coastal
   installations
   Increasing extreme weather events that threaten Navy shore installations
   and air and sea operations
   Climatic shifts in temperature and precipitation with attendant problems
   such as disruption in water resources, reductions in food supply, and
   increase in disease vectors
   This paper provides a broad overview of climate change-related
   technology work at the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center
   (NAVFAC ESC) in Port Hueneme, California. NAVFAC ESC categorized
   technologies that can be applied to climate change as mitigation,
   adaptation, and intervention. An essential element of the Navy's
   response to climate change is assessment of the potential impacts on
   Navy infrastructure. Adaptation technologies primarily focus on
   infrastructure changes to accommodate future climate conditions,
   including relocating facilities. Mitigation technologies seek to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change, typically
   through energy conservation or adoption of alternative energy sources.
   NAVFAC ESC has also identified approaches for intervention technologies
   that seek to alter the impacts of climate change through such means as
   carbon sequestration and storm abatement.},

Title = {Precast Concrete Pavements of High Albedo to Achieve the Net
   ``Zero-Emissions{''} Commitments},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Featured Application: Replacement of black pavements by high-reflective
   concrete pavements is an easy and cost-effective measure to stem climate
   change. In addition, concrete is a building material that is fully
   recyclable at the end of its service life. Furthermore, the construction
   of concrete pavements demands local resources, avoiding greenhouse gas
   emissions due to transport.
   Pavements store heat, which is subsequently released into the
   atmosphere, heating the surrounding air. Therefore, this process
   contributes to climate change and global warming. For this reason, the
   use of high-solar-reflectance (albedo) pavements is seen as one of the
   potential mitigation methods for climate change. Concrete pavements have
   a much higher albedo than asphalt due to their light gray color compared
   with black pavements. Accordingly, the widespread utilization of highly
   reflective concrete pavements will improve local climate change
   mitigation. Nevertheless, concrete albedo slightly decreases over time
   because of weathering. Albedo and solar reflectance index (SRI)
   measurements were taken on actual precast concrete pavements made with
   different mixes. The methodology applied for this project is based on
   the comparison between the asphalt and concrete pavements' reflectivity.
   Conventional concrete mix designs can provide cool pavements with SRI
   higher than 29. Replacement of black pavements by highly reflective
   concrete pavements appeared to be a cost-effective and easily
   implemented measure to combat climate change. Finally, multidisciplinary
   studies considering factors such as building materials' albedo, among
   other mitigation measures, should be performed to provide more precise
   and reliable guidance to policymakers, stakeholders, decision makers and
   urban planners.},

Abstract = {We assessed the effect of greenhouse gas-induced climate change, as well
   as the direct fertilization effect of CO2, on crop yields in Quebec,
   Canada. Our methodology coupled the transient diagnostics of 2
   Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (CGCM1 and HadCM3) to the
   DSSAT 3.5 crop simulation system to simulate current (1961-1990) and
   future (2040-2069) crop yields for spring wheat, maize, soybean and
   potato grown in 8 agricultural regions of Quebec. For the future
   (2040-2069), we predict significant yield increases for soybean, lesser
   increases for wheat, no significant change for maize, and yield
   decreases for potato. These yields, especially for soybean, are further
   increased when incorporating the CO2 fertilization effect, but vary
   according to the crop, climate scenario and agricultural region. Similar
   trends have been found in comparable agricultural regions in the
   Northeastern USA and in Southern Finland. These results are useful for
   designing appropriate crop and farm management adaptation strategies in
   response to future climate change.},

   institutes headed by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), It has been
   designed to enable the user to generate future scenarios of greenhouse

   on global climate and sea level (through two independent global climate
   models), and illustrate some of the consequences of this global climate

   very brief overview of the ESCAPE model which, although innovative,
   suffers from a number of major limitations, Subsequent work in the CRU
   has concentrated on improvements to the global climate module and work
   has also commenced on an improved regional climate scenario generating

Abstract = {The global climate change is an extraordinary complex phenomenon in
   earth's atmosphere. The challenges associated with its change cannot be
   tackled in isolation, but through integrated efforts, taking all six
   spectra together for developing the strategic planning. Logically framed
   six spectra are planetary physical, EM-nuclear, chemical, biological,
   pedogenic and anthropogenic spectra. Soil is rather the lowest boundary
   of the entire earth's atmosphere excluding the portions covered by
   oceans. The global climate change is either natural or man-made or evens
   both. The man-made challenges are manageable with participatory
   commitments in a planned way on site-specific basis through human
   intervention, pedogenic exploitation, etc. On soil surface, the role of
   conservation agriculture as well as horticultural community is of
   special interest to minimize greenhouse gas emission and for promoting
   the soil carbon stock. High-density orchards with proper soil management
   options may be a powerful mitigation option. Microorganisms may play
   vital role in synthesizing biofuels and C-sequestration. However, there
   are controversies in defining each spectrum in terms of mitigation.},

Title = {Uncertainty in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of sustainable
   aviation fuels from vegetable oils},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is one of the most promising short-to
   medium-term term options to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
   aviation. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is commonly used to estimate GHG
   emissions from SAF in comparison to fossil kerosene. While there are
   several studies reporting the GHG emissions from SAF, uncertainty in the
   results is not always addressed in a comprehensive way.In this work, GHG
   emissions of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) fuels derived
   from jatropha (Jatropha curcas), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), castor
   (Ricinus communis), energy tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, Solaris) and
   Salicornia (Salicornia bigelovii) oils were estimated. A stochastic
   methodology was employed where parametric uncertainty was propagated
   using Monte Carlo simulations. Uncertainty due to methodological choices
   was incorporated through scenario analyses. Emissions from direct land
   use change (DLUC) and the associated uncertainty were assessed under the
   IPCC Tier 1 approach by considering alternative land use tran-sitions
   per feedstock.Analyzed HEFA pathways provide GHG emissions benefits
   (34-65\%) in comparison to fossil kerosene when DLUC emissions are not
   considered. Parametric uncertainty yields up to 26\% deviation from the
   median well-to -wake GHG emissions. Changing the allocation choice for
   the oil extraction step, from the base assumption of energy-based
   allocation to mass-or market-based, can impact the results by up to
   46\%. DLUC is a more sig-nificant source of uncertainty than both
   parametric uncertainty and allocation assumptions in the analysis. DLUC
   emissions negate any GHG savings from HEFA fuels if forests or natural
   shrublands are lost.},

Title = {Considering local adaptation increases willingness to mitigate},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {69-75},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Discussing adaptation has previously been viewed as ``taboo{''}, a
   distraction that shifts focus away from mitigation of greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, this view has recently changed as researchers,
   governments, and the UNFCCC have acknowledged the necessity of both
   mitigation and adaptation. Yet there has been little research on the
   public's view of adaptation and whether public consideration of
   adaptation (local or otherwise) might have positive effects or, as
   feared, distract people from mitigation. Contrary to these fears, here
   we experimentally show that consideration of local adaptation to
   sea-level rise significantly increased people's willingness to perform
   personal emissions-reducing behaviors, such as using public transport,
   eating less meat, and flying less. We surveyed residents in the
   Wellington region of New Zealand, randomly assigning respondents either
   to answer questions about climate change and mitigation only, or first
   to answer questions about potential local sea-level rise and adaptation
   measures that could be taken in their region. Respondents who first
   considered this local adaptation scored significantly higher on a
   measure of personal willingness to mitigate, and responses did not
   change depending on participants' level of skepticism of anthropogenic
   climate change. These results reveal the potential for discussion and
   consideration of local adaptation to engage the public in mitigation
   actions, possibly by making the problem of climate change less distant
   and more tangible. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In 2008, the Australian Parliament passed legislation to establish a
   title system of access and property rights for geological storage of
   carbon dioxide in offshore waters. The new Act provides for petroleum
   titles and carbon dioxide storage titles to co-exist in the same area. A
   key concern for pre-existing title holders is the potential for adverse
   impacts on their resource investments. Where oil and gas, and greenhouse
   gas projects are proposed in the same area government policy encourages
   commercial agreements between the parties. In the absence of such
   agreements the Act allows for a significant risk of a significant
   adverse impact (SROSAI) test to be applied by the regulator to consider
   whether an activity in one title area could have a significant risk of a
   significant adverse impact on an activity carried out under the other
   title. The test is based on three core parameters: probability, economic
   impact and economic value of the operations. This paper discusses the
   objective basis for the SROSAI test, the regulations, the methodologies,
   the mathematical formulae, technical requirements, project scenarios and
   mitigation options. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Global mitigation opportunities for the life cycle of natural gas-fired

Abstract = {Natural gas is seen as a key interim fuel along the pathway to a
   zero-carbon energy system, yet there is some concern it may delay the
   transition. This Analysis estimates the life cycle emissions from
   gas-fired electricity and the abatement potential of different
   mitigation options.
   Over 100 countries pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30\% by 2030
   at COP26, but whether gas can serve as a bridge to lower-carbon options
   remains disputed. With an increasingly global supply chain, countries
   have different responsibilities in mitigation. We determine the global
   average of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from the delivery of
   gas-fired electricity to be 645 gCO(2)e kWh(-1) (334-1,389 gCO(2)e
   kWh(-1)), amounting to 3.6 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) in 2017 (10\% of
   energy-related emissions). Deploying mitigation options can reduce
   global emissions from gas-fired power by 71\% with carbon capture and
   storage, methane abatement, and efficiency upgrades contributing 43\%,
   12\% and 5\%, respectively. Mitigation falls within national
   responsibilities, except an annual 20.5 MtCO(2)e of ocean transport
   emissions. For gas to truly be a bridge fuel, countries involved with
   the life cycle of gas-fired power need to deploy all mitigation options
   while balancing the risk of locking in carbon-intensive electricity.},

Title = {The ocean carbon sink - impacts, vulnerabilities and challenges},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {327-358},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is, next to water vapour, considered to be the most
   important natural greenhouse gas on Earth. Rapidly rising atmospheric
   CO2 concentrations caused by human actions such as fossil fuel burning,
   land-use change or cement production over the past 250 years have given
   cause for concern that changes in Earth's climate system may progress at
   a much faster pace and larger extent than during the past 20 000 years.
   Investigating global carbon cycle pathways and finding suitable
   adaptation and mitigation strategies has, therefore, become of major
   concern in many research fields. The oceans have a key role in
   regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations and currently take up about
   25\% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere.
   Questions that yet need to be answered are what the carbon uptake
   kinetics of the oceans will be in the future and how the increase in
   oceanic carbon inventory will affect its ecosystems and their services.
   This requires comprehensive investigations, including high-quality ocean
   carbon measurements on different spatial and temporal scales, the
   management of data in sophisticated databases, the application of Earth
   system models to provide future projections for given emission scenarios
   as well as a global synthesis and outreach to policy makers. In this
   paper, the current understanding of the ocean as an important carbon
   sink is reviewed with respect to these topics. Emphasis is placed on the
   complex interplay of different physical, chemical and biological
   processes that yield both positive and negative air-sea flux values for
   natural and anthropogenic CO2 as well as on increased CO2 (uptake) as
   the regulating force of the radiative warming of the atmosphere and the
   gradual acidification of the oceans. Major future ocean carbon
   challenges in the fields of ocean observations, modelling and process
   research as well as the relevance of other biogeochemical cycles and
   greenhouse gases are discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since coastal wetlands have been severely degraded and polluted by human
   activities, they have increasingly become a significant source of
   greenhouse gases (GHGs), so understanding the characteristics of their
   emissions is critical for devising future climate change mitigation
   strategies. This study modified a model based on carbon balance to
   forecast carbon stored and CO2, CH4 emissions in four types of typical
   tidal flats-Phragmites australis (PA), Spartina alterniflora (SA),
   Suaeda japonica (SJ), and Bare Tidal Flat (BTF) in Korea's Ganghwa
   province from 2017 to 2047. The model was built using biomass data from
   salt plant species collected in different locations. The results
   indicate that the total annual simulated flow of CH4 increased over time
   in all four areas, most notably in SA, while CO2 remained relatively
   stable. The mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the four types of representative
   tidal flats were in the range of 0.03 to 19.1 mg m(-2) d(-1) and 0.007
   to 5.23 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively, across all seasons. Besides, the
   results indicate that the amount of carbon accumulated in the top soil
   increases linearly over time in nearly all areas studied, ranging from
   0.01 to 0.13 (kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). In general, the study provides a model
   for Korean tidal flats that incorporates carbon storage and GHG
   emissions in the intertidal zone in order to develop potential GHG
   reduction scenarios.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have estimated the burden of coronary heart
   disease (CHD) mortality from ambient regional particulate matter <= 2.5
   mu m (PM2.5). The burden of near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) generally
   has not been examined, despite evidence of a causal link with CHD.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated the CHD burden from NRAP and compared it with
   the PM2.5 burden in the California South Coast Air Basin for 2008 and
   under a compact urban growth greenhouse gas reduction scenario for 2035.
   METHODS: We estimated the population attributable fraction and number of
   CHD events attributable to residential traffic density, proximity to a
   major road, elemental carbon (EC), and PM2.5 compared with the expected
   disease burden if the population were exposed to background levels of
   air pollution.
   RESULTS: In 2008, an estimated 1,300 CHD deaths (6.8\% of the total)
   were attributable to traffic density, 430 deaths (2.4\%) to residential
   proximity to a major road, and 690 (3.7\%) to EC. There were 1,900
   deaths (10.4\%) attributable to PM2.5. Although reduced exposures in
   2035 should result in smaller fractions of CHD attributable to traffic
   density, EC, and PM2.5, the numbers of estimated deaths attributable to
   each of these exposures are anticipated to increase to 2,500, 900, and
   2,900, respectively, due to population aging. A similar pattern of
   increasing NRAP-attributable CHD hospitalizations was estimated to occur
   between 2008 and 2035.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a large burden of preventable CHD
   mortality is attributable to NRAP and is likely to increase even with
   decreasing exposure by 2035 due to vulnerability of an aging population.
   Greenhouse gas reduction strategies developed to mitigate climate change
   offer unexploited opportunities for air pollution health co-benefits.},

Abstract = {Mangroves shift from carbon sinks to sources when affected by
   anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change (LULCC). Yet, the magnitude
   and temporal scale of these impacts are largely unknown. We undertook a
   systematic review to examine the influence of LULCC on mangrove carbon
   stocks and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) effluxes. A search of 478 data
   points from the peer-reviewed literature revealed a substantial
   reduction of biomass (82\% +/- 35\%) and soil (54\% +/- 13\%) carbon
   stocks due to LULCC. The relative loss depended on LULCC type, time
   since LULCC and geographical and climatic conditions of sites. We also
   observed that the loss of soil carbon stocks was linked to the decreased
   soil carbon content and increased soil bulk density over the first 100
   cm depth. We found no significant effect of LULCC on soil GHG effluxes.
   Regeneration efforts (i.e. restoration, rehabilitation and
   afforestation) led to biomass recovery after similar to 40 years.
   However, we found no clear patterns of mangrove soil carbon stock
   re-establishment following biomass recovery. Our findings suggest that
   regeneration may help restore carbon stocks back to pre-disturbed levels
   over decadal to century time scales only, with a faster rate for biomass
   recovery than for soil carbon stocks. Therefore, improved mangrove
   ecosystem management by preventing further LULCC and promoting
   rehabilitation is fundamental for effective climate change mitigation
   policy.},

Title = {Climate Change and Livestock Production in India: Effects and Mitigation

Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Climate change poses formidable challenge to the development of
   livestock sector in India. The anticipated rise in temperature between
   2.3 degrees c and 4.8 degrees c over the entire country together with
   increased precipitation resulting from climate change is likely to
   aggravate the heat stress in dairy animals, adversely affecting their
   productive and reproductive performance, and hence reducing the total
   area where high yielding dairy cattle can be economically reared. Given
   the vulnerability of India to rise in sea level, the impact of increased
   intensity of extreme events on the livestock sector would be large and
   devastating for the low-income rural areas. The predicted negative
   impact of climate change on Indian agriculture would also adversely
   affect livestock production by aggravating the feed and fodder
   shortages. The livestock sector which will be a sufferer of climate
   change is itself a large source of methane emissions, an important
   greenhouse gas. In India, although the emission rate per animal is much
   lower than the developed countries, due to vast livestock population the
   total annual methane emissions are about 9-10 Tg from enteric
   fermentation and animal wastes. Other direct or indirect effect such as
   feed resources, water resources and health contributed significantly to
   the change in production pattern in India's livestock industry that
   support more than 70\% of rural populace. It is suggested that strong
   and sound policies to be implemented to preserve local indigenous breeds
   of livestock, improvement of pasture, water resource management,
   research and development would mitigate the monumental consequences of
   climate change on livestock in India.},

Title = {The role of aerosol in altering North Atlantic atmospheric circulation
   in winter and its impact on air quality},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1725-1743},
Abstract = {Numerical model scenarios of future climate depict a global increase in
   temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, primarily driven by
   increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Aerosol particles also
   play an important role by altering the Earth's radiation budget and
   consequently surface temperature. Here, we use the general circulation
   aerosol model ECHAM5-HAM, coupled to a mixed layer ocean model, to
   investigate the impacts of future air pollution mitigation strategies in
   Europe on winter atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. We
   analyse the extreme case of a maximum feasible end-of-pipe reduction of
   aerosols in the near future (2030), in combination with increasing GHG
   concentrations. Our results show a more positive North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) mean state by 2030, together with a significant
   eastward shift of the southern centre of action of sea-level pressure
   (SLP). Moreover, we show a significantly increased blocking frequency
   over the western Mediterranean.
   By separating the impacts of aerosols and GHGs, our study suggests that
   future aerosol abatement may be the primary driver of both the eastward
   shift in the southern SLP centre of action and the increased blocking
   frequency over the western Mediterranean. These concomitant
   modifications of the atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Atlantic
   sector lead to more stagnant weather conditions that favour air
   pollutant accumulation, especially in the western Mediterranean sector.
   Changes in atmospheric circulation should therefore be included in
   future air pollution mitigation assessments. The indicator-based
   evaluation of atmospheric circulation changes presented in this work
   will allow an objective first-order assessment of the role of changes in
   wintertime circulation on future air quality in other climate model
   simulations.},

Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {242-282},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Researchers and policy makers increasingly recognize the need to adapt
   to future changes in climate, given that past emissions of greenhouse
   gases have already committed the world to some level of climate change.
   However, the current understanding of the costs and benefits of
   adaptation measures is still fairly rudimentary, and far from
   comprehensive. An assessment is presented of the current state of
   knowledge on the magnitude of adaptation costs in the United States.
   While incomplete, the studies suggest that adaptation cost could be as
   high as tens or hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the middle
   of this century. Key studies are identified in each sector, and the cost
   estimates and approaches to cost estimation are surveyed. Methodological
   issues are highlighted in interpreting, comparing, and aggregating
   adaptation cost estimates. Policy recommendations are made along with
   appropriate steps to make future adaptation cost studies more comparable
   within and across sectors and more accessible and relevant to policy and
   decision makers.Policy relevanceDesigning and implementing climate
   change adaptation policy requires good information about the
   effectiveness and cost of available adaptive options. The current state
   of knowledge on adaptation costs in the United States is assessed and
   significant gaps in the literature are highlighted - particularly in
   terms of sectoral and geographic coverage - as well as inconsistencies
   in methodologies and assumptions that hamper comparison across studies.
   Critical steps are identified that can be taken to make adaptation cost
   studies more accessible and useful to decision makers. The findings and
   recommendations are relevant to adaptation cost studies globally, not
   just in the United States.},

Title = {Sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the landscape: Approach for
   spatially explicit estimates},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {781},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Climate change mitigation is a global response that requires actions at
   the local level. Quantifying local sources and sinks of greenhouse gases
   (GHG) facilitate evaluating mitigation options. We present an approach
   to collate spatially explicit estimated fluxes of GHGs (carbon dioxide,
   methane and nitrous oxide) for main land use sectors in the landscape,
   to aggregate, and to calculate the net emissions of an entire region.
   Our procedure was developed and tested in a large river basin in
   Finland, providing information from intensively studied eLTER research
   sites. To evaluate the full GHG balance, fluxes from natural ecosystems
   (lakes, rivers, and undrained mires) were included together with fluxes
   from anthropogenic activities, agriculture and forestry. We quantified
   the fluxes based on calculations with an anthropogenic emissions model
   (FRES) and a forest growth and carbon balance model (PREBAS), as well as
   on emission coefficients from the literature regarding emissions from
   lakes, rivers, undrained mires, peat extraction sites and cropland.
   Spatial data sources included CORINE land use data, soil map, lake and
   river shorelines, national forest inventory data, and statistical data
   on anthropogenic activities. Emission uncertainties were evaluated with
   Monte Carlo simulations. Artificial surfaces were the most emission
   intensive land-cover class. Lakes and rivers were about as emission
   intensive as arable land. Forests were the dominant land cover in the
   region (66\%), and the C sink of the forests decreased the total
   emissions of the region by 72\%. The region's net emissions amounted to
   4.37 +/- 1.43 Tg CO2-eq yr(-1), corresponding to a net emission
   intensity 0.16 Gg CO2-eq km(-2) yr(-1), and estimated per capita net
   emissions of 5.6 Mg CO2-eq yr(-1). Our landscape approach opens
   opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important GHG fluxes to
   changes in land use and climate, management actions, and mitigation of
   anthropogenic emissions. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper proposes a makeshift approach to carbon accounting in
   Egyptian towns, which takes into account the limited resources of local
   municipalities and the widespread lack of available data. Egypt is
   highly vulnerable to climate change. Escalating temperatures, water
   scarcity, and rising sea levels threaten all parts of society. Cities
   absorb a growing portion of the increasing population and are especially
   exposed to the precarious effects of global warming. Consequently, there
   is an emergent need for mitigation and adaptation measures in urban
   areas, which presuppose an adequate accounting of the local greenhouse
   gas emissions. This paper suggest a series of six steps that can be
   followed by municipal decision makers to estimate their emissions by
   collecting existing information on site and utilizing systematic
   approximations to make up for missing statistics. (C) 2016 The Authors

Abstract = {Nations of the world have, to date, pursued nature protection and
   climate change mitigation and adaptation policies separately. Both
   efforts have failed to achieve the scale of action needed to halt
   biodiversity loss or mitigate climate change. We argue that success can
   be achieved by aligning targets for biodiversity protection with the
   habitat protection and restoration necessary to bring down greenhouse
   gas concentrations and promote natural and societal adaptation to
   climate change. Success, however, will need much higher targets for
   environmental protection than the present 10\% of sea and 17\% of land.
   A new target of 30\% of the sea given high levels of protection from
   exploitation and harm by 2030 is under consideration and similar targets
   are being discussed for terrestrial habitats. We make the case here that
   these higher targets, if achieved, would make the transition to a warmer
   world slower and less damaging for nature and people. This article is
   part of the theme issue `Climate change and ecosystems: threats,
   opportunities and solutions'.},

Abstract = {Micronutrient deficiencies are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
   in low- and middle-income countries worldwide. Climate change,
   characterized by increasing global surface temperatures and alterations
   in rainfall, has the capacity to affect the quality and accessibility of
   micronutrient-rich foods. The goals of this review are to summarize the
   potential effects of climate change and its consequences on agricultural
   yield and micronutrient quality, primarily zinc, iron, and vitamin A, of
   plant foods and upon the availability of animal foods, to discuss the
   implications for micronutrient deficiencies in the future, and to
   present possible mitigation and adaptive strategies. In general, the
   combination of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and rising
   temperature is predicted to reduce the overall yield of major staple
   crops, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, more than altering their
   micronutrient content. Crop yield is also reduced by elevated
   ground-level ozone and increased extreme weather events. Pollinator loss
   is expected to reduce the yield of many pollinator-dependent crops such
   as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Sea-level rise resulting from melting
   of ice sheets and glaciers is predicted to result in coastal inundation,
   salt intrusion, and loss of coral reefs and mangrove forests, with an
   adverse impact upon coastal rice production and coastal fisheries.
   Global ocean fisheries catch is predicted to decline because of ocean
   warming and declining oxygen. Freshwater warming is also expected to
   alter ecosystems and reduce inland fisheries catch. In addition to
   limiting greenhouse gas production, adaptive strategies include
   postharvest fortification of foods; micronutrient supplementation;
   biofortification of staple crops with zinc and iron; plant breeding or
   genetic approaches to increase zinc, iron, and provitamin A carotenoid
   content of plant foods; and developing staple crops that are tolerant of
   abiotic stressors such as elevated carbon dioxide, elevated temperature,
   and increased soil salinity.
   Statement of Significance: This comprehensive review shows that climate
   change and its consequences are likely to affect micronutrient
   malnutrition by limiting the availability of micronutrient-rich plant
   and animal foods rather than their micronutrient content. Various
   mitigating and adaptive strategies should be considered to reduce the
   risk of micronutrient malnutrition in vulnerable populations in the face
   of climate change.},

Abstract = {The pace of climate change and the consequent warming of the Earth's
   surface is increasing vulnerability and decreasing adaptive capacity.
   Achieving a successful adaptation depends on the development of
   technology, institutional organization, financing availability and the
   exchange of information. Populations living in arid and semi-arid zones,
   low-lying coastal areas, land with water shortages or at risk of
   overflow or small islands are particularly vulnerable to climate change.
   Due to increasing population density in sensitive areas, some regions
   have become more vulnerable to events such as storms, floods and
   droughts, like the river basins and coastal plains. Human activities
   have fragmented and increased the vulnerability of ecosystems, which
   limit both, their natural adaptation and the effectiveness of the
   measures adopted. Adaptation means to carry out the necessary
   modifications for society to adapt to new climatic conditions in order
   to reduce their vulnerability to climate change. Adaptive capacity is
   the ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate
   variability and extremes) and to moderate potential damages, to take
   advantage of opportunities or face the consequences. Adaptation reduces
   the adverse impacts of climate change and enhance beneficial impacts,
   but will not prevent substantial cost that are produced by all damages.
   The performances require adaptation actions. These are defined and
   implemented at national, regional or local levels since many of the
   impacts and vulnerabilities depend on the particular economic,
   geographic and social circumstances of each country or region. We will
   present some adaptation strategies at national and local level and
   revise some cases of its implementation in several vulnerable areas.
   However, adaptation to climate change must be closely related to
   mitigation policies because the degree of change planned in different
   climatic variables is a function of the concentration levels that are
   achieved by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Mitigation and
   adaptation are therefore complementary actions. In the long term,
   climate change without mitigation measures will likely exceed the
   adaptive capacity of natural, managed and human systems. Early adoption
   of mitigation measures would break the dependence on carbon-intensive
   infrastructures and reduce adaptation needs to climate change. It also
   can save on adaptation cost. Therefore mitigation is the key objective
   of the global warming problem but little is being done in this field. We
   will present some proposals of ``preventive economically efficient{''}
   policies at a global and regional level which will constitute the
   complement to the adaptation aspect. This paper begins with an overview
   on the complexities of vulnerability in the context of poverty and
   climate change. It continues with an exploration of mitigation and
   adaptation strategies, their cost and their links with sustainable
   development.},

Abstract = {The urban environment directly influences Urban Boundary Layer (UBL)
   dynamics. Commonly proposed heat adaptation strategies focused on
   reducing the impacts of global change and urban induced warming are also
   expected to decrease the intensity of convective mixing thereby reducing
   UBL depth, with important consequences for air pollutant dilution and
   dispersion. We use 20-km grid spacing Regional Climate Model decadal
   scale simulations that account for end of twenty-first century
   greenhouse gas emissions, urban development and intensive and uniform
   implementation of a suite of heat adaptation strategies, to investigate
   the individual and combined impacts of such drivers on UBL dynamics over
   the Continental US (CONUS). Results indicate that combined impacts of
   climate change and urban development are expected to increase summer
   (JJA) daytime UBL height in the eastern CONUS. Heat adaptation
   strategies lead to a summer daytime UBL depth reduction of several
   hundred meters across CONUS regions, primarily as a consequence of
   reduced surface sensible heat fluxes and associated turbulence. Our
   results confirm that heat adaptation is expected to increase the static
   stability of both daytime and nighttime UBLs and decrease the magnitude
   of vertical winds, inducing stronger subsidence. In addition, the large
   geographical scale of our analysis indicates that adaptation impacts are
   greater inland and smaller over coastal cities. In Southern California,
   the adaptation induced increase in latent heat can counterbalance the
   projected decrease in UBL depth. Future work addressing these projected
   UBL impacts with convection permitting, high-resolution coupled
   atmosphere-chemistry simulations is needed to explicitly determine
   potential unintended consequences for urban air quality.},

Abstract = {Increasingly countries are seeking to reduce emission of greenhouse

   particular, as part of their climate change management. While many
   reviews update progress in mitigation research, a quantitative
   assessment of the efficacy and performance-consequences of nutritional
   strategies to mitigate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants
   has been lacking. A meta-analysis was conducted based on 108 refereed
   papers from recent animal studies (2000-2020) to report effects on CH4
   production, CH4 yield and CH4 emission intensity from 8 dietary
   interventions. The interventions (oils, microalgae, nitrate, ionophores,
   protozoal control, phytochemicals, essential oils and
   3-nitrooxypropanol). Of these, macroalgae and 3-nitrooxypropanol showed
   greatest efficacy in reducing CH4 yield (g CH4/kg of dry matter intake)
   at the doses trialled. The confidence intervals derived for the
   mitigation efficacies could be applied to estimate the potential to
   reduce national livestock emissions through the implementation of these
   dietary interventions. (c) 2021 Chinese Association of Animal Science

Abstract = {The global atmosphere is a chemically complex and dynamic system,
   interacting both internally, mostly within the troposphere and
   stratosphere, and with the oceans, land, and living organisms. Its
   composition is changing today, and has also changed markedly over the
   last 400,000 yr. Current understanding of this complex system resulting
   from recent observations, theory, and laboratory and modeling studies is
   reviewed. Also, results are presented from the Integrated Global System
   Model (IGSM). This is a coupled model of economic development,
   atmospheric chemistry, climate dynamics and ecosystem processes that
   explores possible future changes in atmospheric composition and climate.
   The results of an uncertainty analysis involving hundreds of runs of the
   IGSM imply that, without specific mitigation policies, the global
   average surface temperature may rise between 1.0 and 4.9degreesC from
   1990 to 2100 (95\% confidence limits). Polar temperatures, absent
   policy, are projected to rise from about 1 to 12degreesC (95\% limits)
   with obvious great risks for high latitude ecosystems and ice sheets at
   the high end of this range. Analysis of the Kyoto Protocol, and a more
   stringent climate mitigation policy, shows the difficulties in
   accounting simply for the effects of other greenhouse gases relative to
   carbon dioxide. Also, the greatest effect of these policies is to lower
   the probability of extreme changes as opposed to lowering the medians.},

Title = {Identifying the trade-offs between climate change mitigation and
   adaptation in urban land use planning: An empirical study in a coastal
   city},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {133},
Number = {B},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cities play a significant role in climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. Urban land planning shapes the urban form and is considered
   to be an effective approach for climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. Yet, there is little knowledge about what urban forms can
   reduce both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate stresses while
   considering trade-offs between them. Here, we investigate the role of
   urban land use in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In
   particular, we assess quantitatively the competition between strategies
   for mitigation and adaptation and identify potential win-win solutions
   in land use responses. Using a coastal city as a case study, we find
   that the land use strategies for unilateral mitigation or adaptation can
   cause contradicting consequences with respect to the reductions in GHG
   emissions and climate stresses, i.e. reductions in GHGs could increase
   climate stresses or vice versa. Poorly integrated strategies potentially
   may compromise international efforts to meet the Climate Action in the
   Sustainable Development Goals. Properly integrated mitigation and
   adaptation strategies, or climate-sensitive land use planning, however,
   can lead to win-win outcomes and eventually achieve co-benefits. Yet,
   any co-benefits will gradually diminish if there is a delay in
   climate-sensitive land use planning, implying growing GHGs and
   intensified climate stresses. Our analysis indicates that integrating
   climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban land use needs to be
   enacted as soon as possible: any delays in implementation reduce the
   window to act to maximize the co-benefits.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {9},
Pages = {764-778},
Abstract = {Prescribed burning is a critical tool for managing wildfire risks and
   meeting ecological objectives, but its safe and effective application
   requires that specific meteorological criteria (a `burn window') are
   met. Here, we evaluate the potential impacts of projected climatic
   change on prescribed burning in the south-eastern United States by
   applying a set of burn window criteria that capture temperature,
   relative humidity and wind speed to projections from an ensemble of
   Global Climate Models under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
   Regionally, the percentage of suitable days for burning changes little
   during winter but decreases substantially in summer owing to rising
   temperatures by the end of the 21st century compared with historical
   conditions. Management implications of such changes for six
   representative land management units include seasonal shifts in burning
   opportunities from summer to cool-season months, but with considerable
   regional variation. We contend that the practical constraints of rising
   temperatures on prescribed fire activities represent a significant
   future challenge and show that even meeting basic burn criteria (as
   defined today) will become increasingly difficult over time, which
   speaks to the need for adaptive management strategies to prepare for
   such changes.},

Title = {Review of Methane Mitigation Technologies with Application to Rapid
   Release of Methane from the Arctic},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {46},
Number = {12},
Pages = {6455-6469},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Methane is the most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, with
   particular influence on near-term climate change. It poses increasing
   risk in the future from both direct anthropogenic sources and potential
   rapid release from the Arctic. A range of mitigation (emissions control)
   technologies have been developed for anthropogenic sources that can be
   developed for further application, including to Arctic sources.
   Significant gaps in understanding remain of the mechanisms, magnitude,
   and likelihood of rapid methane release from the Arctic. Methane may be
   released by several pathways, including lakes, wetlands, and oceans, and
   may be either uniform over large areas or concentrated in patches.
   Across Arctic sources, bubbles originating in the sediment are the most
   important mechanism for methane to reach the atmosphere. Most known
   technologies operate on confined gas streams of 0.1\% methane or more,
   and may be applicable to limited Arctic sources where methane is
   concentrated in pockets. However, some mitigation strategies developed
   for rice paddies and agricultural soils are promising for Arctic
   wetlands and thawing permafrost. Other mitigation strategies specific to
   the Arctic have been proposed but have yet to be studied. Overall, we
   identify four avenues of research and development that can serve the
   dual purposes of addressing current methane sources and potential Arctic
   sources: (1) methane release detection and quantification, (2)
   mitigation units for small and remote methane streams, (3) mitigation
   methods for dilute (<1000 ppm) methane streams, and (4) understanding
   methanotroph and methanogen ecology.},

Title = {Sustainable urban planning strategies for mitigating climate change in
   Saudi Arabia},

Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {5129-5152},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There is a growing attention on the role of rapidly growing developing
   countries in mitigating climate change, especially in curbing the
   emissions of greenhouse gases. Estimates show that in the year 2011,
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from developing countries constituted
   about 63\% of the world's total, compared with only 37\% for developed
   countries. Thus, developing countries must be an integral part of global
   actions toward combating climate change. In Saudi Arabia, the energy use
   per capita of 6937.23 kg of oil equivalent in 2014 was 3.6 times the
   global average and the per capita CO2 emission of 19.53 metric tons was
   the seventh highest. With sensitive ecosystems, limited freshwater
   resources and substantial coastal developments, the country is
   vulnerable to climate change. As such, the country has recently
   initiated some sustainable urban planning strategies in its major urban
   centers as part of its climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.
   However, few studies have assessed the extent of the implementation of
   the strategies. Based on secondary data analysis, this article found
   that the implementation of the strategies is at infancy with urban
   greening, public transportation, and green building projects gradually
   gaining prominence. The paper recommends more focus on rising building
   and population density, mandating mixed land uses, as well as public
   enlightenment and engagement about climate change impacts and energy
   choices.},

Abstract = {Attempts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or manage the effects of
   climate change traditionally focus on management or policy options that
   promote single outcomes (e.g., either benefiting ecosystems or human
   health and well-being). In contrast, co-benefits approaches to climate
   change mitigation and adaptation address climate change impacts on human
   and ecological health in tandem and on a variety of spatial and temporal
   scales. The article engages the concept of co-benefits through four case
   studies. The case studies emphasize co-benefits approaches that are
   accessible and tractable in countries with human populations that are
   particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. They illustrate the
   potential of co-benefits approaches and provide a platform for further
   discussion of several interdependent principles relevant to the
   implementation of co-benefits strategies. These principles include
   providing incentives across multiple scales and time frames, promoting
   long-term integrated impact assessment, and fostering multidimensional
   communication networks.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fossil fuel consumption, luxurious lifestyles, population and economic
   growths are drivers of climate change. Rampant rise in Greenhouse Gases
   (GHG) emissions drives the big wheel of climate change which affects
   human societies, animal habitats and woodlands by flash floods, glacial
   melts, acidic rains, droughts, famines, wildfires, epidemics, heat and
   cold waves. South Asia is one of the most severely affected regions on
   the planet due to its demographics. The per capita impact of climate
   change on the millions of Pakistanis is very high compared to their
   diminutive per capita share of global GHG emissions. Environmental
   issues of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
   countries include deforestation, air pollution, desertification, glacial
   melts, sea level rise, water contamination and loss of biodiversity.
   Pakistan is among the top ten countries worst hit by climate change,
   where native populations of lions, leopards, dolphins, tortoise and
   vultures face extinction threat. Acacia and rosewood tree forests in
   Sindh, Punjab and Pak-Afghan precincts have already dried by dieback
   disease during 1998-2005. Hundreds of people succumb to death annually
   by heat waves in South during summer and cold waves in North during
   winter. Climate change is a global phenomenon; nevertheless, higher GHG
   emissions first affect local and regional territories and later impact
   worldwide. Pakistan's CO2 emissions are greater than least developed
   SAARC countries but much lower than the nearby Himalayan slope
   countries. This paper reports impact of CO2 emissions on society,
   forests, crops and wildlife in Pakistan recounting adaptation and
   mitigation strategies in SAARC countries. We present simulation results
   for a future super smart grid connecting Central Asian States (CAS) to
   SAARC countries for bilateral electricity trade, progress in carbon
   capture and storage technologies in SAARC countries, and original
   research on utilizing CO2 (R744) for water heating in extremely cold

Abstract = {Carbon offsetting-receiving credit for reducing, avoiding, or
   sequestering carbon-has become part of the portfolio of solutions to
   mitigate carbon emissions, and thus climate change, through policy and
   voluntary markets, primarily by land-based re- or afforestation and
   preservation {[}1, 2]. However, land is limiting, creating interest in a
   rapidly growing aquatic farming sector of seaweed aquaculture {[}3-5].
   Synthesizing data from scientific literature, we assess the extent and
   cost of scaling seaweed aquaculture to provide sufficient CO(2)eq
   sequestration for several climate change mitigation scenarios, with a
   focus on the food sector-a major source of greenhouse gases {[}6]. Given
   known ecological constraints (nutrients and temperature), we found a
   substantial suitable area (ca. 48 million km(2)) for seaweed farming,
   which is largely unfarmed. Within its own industry, seaweed could create
   a carbon-neutral aquaculture sector with just 14\% (mean = 25\%) of
   current seaweed production (0.001\% of suitable area). At a much larger
   scale, we find seaweed culturing extremely unlikely to offset global
   agriculture, in part due to production growth and cost constraints. Yet
   offsetting agriculture appears more feasible at a regional level,
   especially areas with strong climate policy, such as California (0.065\%
   of suitable area). Importantly, seaweed farming can provide other
   benefits to coastlines affected by eutrophic, hypoxic, and/or acidic
   conditions {[}7, 8], creating opportunities for seaweed farming to act
   as ``charismatic carbon{''} that serves multiple purposes. Seaweed
   offsetting is not the sole solution to climate change, but it provides
   an invaluable new tool for a more sustainable future.},

   currently assisting 56 country studies to address climate change. There
   are strong components of ocean and coastal assessment, adaptation and

Abstract = {India has 64 Mha under forests, of which 72\% are tropical moist
   deciduous, dry deciduous, and wet evergreen forest. Projected changes in
   temperature, rainfall, and soil moisture are considered at regional
   level for India under two scenarios, the first involving greenhouse gas
   forcing, and the second, sulphate aerosols. Under the former model, a
   general increase in temperature and rainfall in all regions is
   indicated. This could potentially result in increased productivity, and
   shift forest type boundaries along attitudinal and rainfall gradients,
   with species migrating from lower to higher elevations and the drier
   forest types bring transformed to moister types. The aerosol model,
   however, indicates a more modest increase in temperature and a decrease
   in precipitation in central and northern India, which would considerably
   stress the forests in these regions.
   Although India seems to have stabilized the area under forest since
   1980, anthropogenic stresses such as livestock pressure, biomass demand
   for fuelwood and timber, and the fragmented nature of forests will all
   affect forest response to changing climate. Thus, forest area is
   unlikely to expand even if climatically suitable, and will probably
   decrease in parts of northeast India due to extensive shifting
   cultivation and deforestation. A number of general adaptation measures
   to climate change are listed.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {30},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {Ocean iron fertilization is being considered as a strategy for
   mitigating the buildup of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere.
   Assessment of this strategy requires consideration of its unintended
   consequences, such as an enhancement of ocean N2O emissions. This
   feedback could offset the radiative benefit from the atmospheric CO2
   reduction significantly, because N2O is a much more powerful greenhouse
   gas than CO2 itself. Our model results show that the magnitude of this
   offsetting effect is substantial, but is highly dependent on the
   location and duration of fertilization. We find the largest offsets (of
   the order of 100\%) when fertilization is undertaken in the tropics,
   particularly when it is of limited duration and size. Smaller, but still
   substantial effects are found when fertilization is undertaken elsewhere
   and over longer periods. These results suggest that any assessment of
   ocean fertilization as a mitigating option is incomplete without
   consideration of the N2O feedback.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the AMPERE modeling comparison
   project with focus on the implications of near-term policies for the
   costs and attainability of long-term climate objectives. Nine modeling
   teams participated in the project to explore the consequences of global
   emissions following the proposed policy stringency of the national
   pledges from the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements to 2030.
   Specific features compared to earlier assessments are the explicit
   consideration of near-term 2030 emission targets as well as the
   systematic sensitivity analysis for the availability and potential of
   mitigation technologies. Our estimates show that a 2030 mitigation
   effort comparable to the pledges would result in a further ``lock-in{''}
   of the energy system into fossil fuels and thus impede the required
   energy transformation to reach low greenhouse-gas stabilization levels
   (450 ppm CO(2)e). Major implications include significant increases in
   mitigation costs, increased risk that low stabilization targets become
   unattainable, and reduced chances of staying below the proposed
   temperature change target of 2 degrees C in case of overshoot. With
   respect to technologies, we find that following the pledge pathways to
   2030 would narrow policy choices, and increases the risks that some
   currently optional technologies, such as carbon capture and storage
   (CCS) or the large-scale deployment of bioenergy, will become ``a
   must{''} by 2030. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Climate and carbon risk of tourism in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},
Abstract = {Europe accounts for 51\% of international tourist arrivals and the
   tourism industry provides about 10\% of workplaces in Europe. Tourism
   will be impacted by climate change in a diverse number of ways. At the
   same time, tourism is also a significant contributor of greenhouse gas
   emissions. The aim of this article is, therefore, to provide an
   assessment of climate and carbon risks for the European tourism industry
   based on a systematic literature review. Climate risk is the dominant
   category with 313 papers (74\%), while 110 papers (26\%) were on carbon
   risks. The following gaps were identified: geographical gaps, especially
   in countries of the former Soviet Union and former Yugoslavia; a lack of
   coherent studies on national tourism's and its sub-sectors' emissions;
   research addressing how climate policies might affect tourism demand;
   assessments of the integrated carbon and climate risks; lack of evidence
   on the link between tourism climate indicators and tourism demand; lack
   of climate change and tourism studies addressing policy and
   institutional tools for adaptation and implementation of adaptation
   measures in destinations; and research on rising sea levels and coastal
   erosion and its impacts on tourism destinations and demand.},

Title = {Climate Change Hotspots Identification in China through the CMIP5 Global
   Climate Model Ensemble},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {China is one of the countries vulnerable to adverse climate changes. The
   potential climate change hotspots in China throughout the 21st century
   are identified in this study by using a multimodel, multiscenario
   climate model ensemble that includes Phase Five of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) atmosphere-ocean general circulation
   models. Both high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP4.5) greenhouse gas emission
   trajectories are tested, and both the mean and extreme seasonal
   temperature and precipitation are considered in identifying regional
   climate change hotspots. Tarim basin and Tibetan Plateau in West China
   are identified as persistent regional climate change hotspots in both
   the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The aggregate impacts of climate change
   increase throughout the 21st century and are more significant in RCP8.5
   than in RCP4.5. Extreme hot event and mean temperature are two climate
   variables that greatly contribute to the hotspots calculation in all
   regions. The contribution of other climate variables exhibits a notable
   subregional variability. South China is identified as another hotspot
   based on the change of extreme dry event, especially in SON and DJF,
   which indicates that such event will frequently occur in the future. Our
   results can contribute to the designing of national and cross-national
   adaptation and mitigation policies.},

Abstract = {National greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories are essential for public
   policy planning to mitigate GHG emissions. They provide critical
   information and enhance environmental integrity in planning and
   development of GHG mitigation policy.
   The characteristics of a high quality inventory are that it follows good
   practice according to the IPCC guidelines. The key components of good
   practice are that the inventory is transparent to others, has accurate
   and complete emissions estimates for all gases, sources and sinks; has
   consistent application of methods across time; and is comparable to
   inventories from other countries {[}1]. While developed countries
   struggle with implementation of good practice, most can produce
   reasonably high quality inventories {[}2]. However, the task is more
   challenging in low lying pacific island countries. Some of the specific
   challenges include: lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities of
   agencies in preparing inventories; small teams with limited resources;
   difficulty in retaining expertise; incomplete or non-existent activity
   data; inconsistent data between inventories; absence of an archiving
   system for previous inventories; no QA/QC plan {[}3].
   As part of the UN-REDD Programme project on ``Strengthening Regional
   Support to National Forest Monitoring Systems for REDD+ in the
   Pacific{''} a Regional Monitoring System has been developed to support
   low lying pacific island countries (Republic of Palau, Tuvalu, Cook
   Islands, Tonga, Republic of Kiribati, and Federated States of
   Micronesia). Using the Republic of Palau as a case study, we present
   this system and focus on four main challenges; 1) improving activity
   data compilation through systematic land use assessment 2) application
   of simple land use mapping algorithms 3) application of a regional
   geo-spatial portal to support improved data management 4) application of
   open-source land use analysis systems to help manage and analyze
   inventory data.},

Title = {Unravelling a large methane emission discrepancy in Mexico using
   satellite observations},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {260},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We use satellite observations from the Tropospheric Monitoring
   Instrument (TROPOMI) to map and quantify methane emissions from eastern
   Mexico using an atmospheric inverse analysis. Eastern Mexico covers the
   vast majority of the national oil and gas production. Using TROPOMI
   measurements from May 2018 to December 2019, our methane emission
   estimates for eastern Mexico are 5.0 +/- 0.2 Tg a-1 for anthropogenic
   sources and 1.5 +/- 0.1 Tg a-1 for natural sources, representing 45\%
   and 34\% higher annual methane fluxes respectively compared to the most
   recent estimates based on the Mexican national greenhouse gas inventory.
   Our results show that Mexico's oil and gas sector has the largest
   discrepancy, with oil and gas emissions (1.3 +/- 0.2 Tg a-1) higher by a
   factor of two relative to bottom-up estimates-accounting for a quarter
   of total anthropogenic emissions. Our satellite-based inverse modeling
   estimates show that more than half of the oil/gas emissions in eastern
   Mexico are from the southern onshore basin (0.79 +/- 0.13 Tg a-1),
   pointing at high emission sources which are not represented in current
   bottom-up inventories (e.g., venting of associated gas, high-emitting
   gathering/processing facilities related to the transport of associated
   gas from offshore). These findings suggest that stronger mitigation
   measures are critical to curbing the anthropogenic footprint of methane
   emissions in Mexico, especially the large contribution from the oil and
   gas sector.},

Title = {To graze or not to graze? Four years greenhouse gas balances and
   vegetation composition from a drained and a rewetted organic soil under
   grassland},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {222},
Pages = {156-170},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Nutrient-poor organic soils under maritime grassland are often located
   in remote wet locations in the landscape. Leaving these soils without
   drainage maintenance often raise the water table but continuous
   management (grazing) means they could remain a source of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) while also turning into a small source of methane (CH4). Due to
   geographical and socio-economic reasons, removing these sites from
   agricultural production may be an option to mitigate greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. To test this hypothesis we measured GHG fluxes over a
   four year period, at a drained and a rewetted organic soil under
   grassland, which were both grazed for the first two years and not grazed
   for the following two years. Statistical response functions estimated
   for gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) were
   used to reconstruct annual CO2-C balances using site-specific models
   driven by soil temperature, solar radiation, soil water table (WT) and
   leaf area index (LAI). Annually, soil CO2 emissions were comparable when
   grazed, although the rewetted site had a lower net ecosystem carbon
   balance (NECB) despite displaying higher CH4 emissions. Both sites have
   lower CO2 emissions than typical drained organic soils due to management
   practices: extensive grazing, no fertilisation and mean annual water
   tables above-25 cm. When grazing stopped, GPP and Reco increased
   dramatically driven by vigorous growth of vegetation at both sites. The
   shallow drained site remained a source of CO2 and small source of CH4
   while the rewetted site became either neutral or a small sink of CO2
   with decreased CH4 emissions compared to the grazing period. Nitrous
   oxide (N2O) emissions were negligible at either site. Removing grazing
   significantly reduced the NECB at both sites but in terms of global
   warming potential (GWP), the greatest GHG mitigation was in the rewetted
   site which exerted a cooling effect in the second year after the
   management shift. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A multitude of actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore
   natural and modified ecosystems can have co-benefits for both climate
   mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Reducing greenhouse emissions
   to limit warming to less than 1.5 or 2 degrees C above preindustrial
   levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, can yield strong co-benefits
   for land, freshwater and marine biodiversity and reduce amplifying
   climate feedbacks from ecosystem changes. Not all climate mitigation
   strategies are equally effective at producing biodiversity co-benefits,
   some in fact are counterproductive. Moreover, social implications are
   often overlooked within the climate-biodiversity nexus. Protecting
   biodiverse and carbon-rich natural environments, ecological restoration
   of potentially biodiverse and carbon-rich habitats, the deliberate
   creation of novel habitats, taking into consideration a locally adapted
   and meaningful (i.e. full consequences considered) mix of these
   measures, can result in the most robust win-win solutions. These can be
   further enhanced by avoidance of narrow goals, taking long-term views
   and minimizing further losses of intact ecosystems. In this review
   paper, we first discuss various climate mitigation actions that evidence
   demonstrates can negatively impact biodiversity, resulting in unseen and
   unintended negative consequences. We then examine climate mitigation
   actions that co-deliver biodiversity and societal benefits. We give
   examples of these win-win solutions, categorized as `protect, restore,
   manage and create', in different regions of the world that could be
   expanded, upscaled and used for further innovation.},

Title = {Managing tourism emissions through optimizing the tourism demand mix:
   Concept and analysis},
Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {81},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon mitigation strategies are an urgent and overdue tourism industry
   imperative. The tourism response to climate action has been to engage
   businesses in technology adoption, and to encourage more sustainable
   visitor behaviour. These strategies however are insufficient to mitigate
   the soaring carbon footprint of tourism. Building upon the concepts of
   optimization and eco-efficiency, we put forward a novel carbon
   mitigation approach, which seeks to pro-actively determine, foster, and
   develop a long-term tourist market portfolio. This can be achieved
   through intervening and reconfiguring the demand mix with the
   fundamental aim of promoting low carbon travel markets. The concept and
   the analytical framework that quantitatively inform optimization of the
   desired market mix are presented. Combining the ``de-growth{''} and
   ``optimization{''} strategies, it is demonstrated that in the case study
   of Taiwan, great potential exists to reduce emissions and sustain
   economic yields. The implications for tourism destination managers and
   wider industry stakeholders are discussed.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions hotspots and drivers of urban freshwater bodies
   in areas of the Yangtze River delta, China},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Abstract = {In the modern era, urban freshwater bodies play a significant role in
   global carbon (C) budgeting, therefore, impacting climate change under
   rising global mean temperature. However, the trend, magnitude and
   drivers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in these urban freshwater
   bodies of China remain uncertain. This study investigated temporal
   changes in GHG emissions in urban water bodies, including artificial
   lakes, reservoirs, aquaculture ponds and rivers, within a year in
   Nanjing city in the areas of the Yangtze River delta of China. In
   addition, meteorological and hydrochemical parameters were measured to
   elucidate the key drivers of GHG emissions. The results showed that the
   average annual flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in
   aquaculture ponds was estimated to be 1355.6 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and
   116.6 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1), followed by that of artificial lakes were
   1172.2 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and 44.1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1), rivers
   reached 775.9 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and 23.9 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) and
   reservoirs were 170.1 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and 7.2 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1),
   respectively. The results further suggest that although artificial lakes
   and aquaculture ponds occupied only 23\% of the cumulative area under
   lakes and ponds in the Yangtze River delta, contribute approximately
   43\%, about 27.5 Gg C, of total fluxes. Furthermore, high concentrations
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and low dissolved oxygen (DO)
   coincided with the high GHG emissions. The study suggests that DO, DOC,
   temperature and wind speed are the key factors impacting the potential
   of GHG emissions in urban freshwater ecosystems. Strategic mitigation
   measures in the vicinity of the urban freshwater bodies could
   efficiently reduce carbon emissions in the future.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, interest in the effects of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions on global climate change has peaked. Increasing
   temperatures worldwide have been blamed for numerous negative impacts on
   agriculture, weather, forestry, marine ecosystems, and human health. The
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that the primary GHG
   emitted in the U.S. is carbon dioxide (CO2) most of which stems from
   fossil fuel combustion {[}1]. In fact, CO2 represents approximately 85\%
   of all GHG emissions nationwide. The other primary GHGs include nitrous
   oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), ozone (O-3), and fluorinated gases.
   Since the energy sector is responsible for a majority of the GHGs
   released into the atmosphere, policies that address their mitigation
   through the production of electricity using renewable fuels and
   distributed generation are of significant interest. Use of renewable
   fuels and clean technologies to meet energy demand instead of relying on
   traditional electrical grid systems is expected to result in fewer CO2
   and CH4 emissions, hence reducing global climate change impacts.
   Technologies considered cleaner include photovoltaics, wind turbines,
   and combined heat and power (CHP) devices using microturbines or
   internal combustion engines. The Self-Generation Incentive Program
   (SGIP) in California {[}2] provides incentives for the installation of
   these technologies under certain circumstances.
   This paper assesses the GHG emission impacts from California's SGIP
   during the 2005 program year by estimating the reductions in CO2 and CH4
   released when SGIP projects are in operation. Our analysis focuses on
   these emissions since these are the two GHGs characteristic of SGIP
   projects. Results of this analysis show that emissions of GHGs are
   reduced due to the SGIP. This is because projects operating under this
   program reduce reliance on electricity generated by conventional power
   plants and - encourage the use of renewable fuels, such as captured
   waste heat and methane.},

Abstract = {Mitigation of climate change by intentionally storing carbon in tropical
   forests, soils, and wetlands and by reducing greenhouse gas fluxes from
   these settings has been promoted as rapidly deployable and
   cost-effective. This approach, sometimes referred to as ``natural
   climate solutions,{''} could keep post-industrialization warming below
   1.5 degrees C, when coupled with reductions in fossil fuel emissions, as
   confirmed here with a simple numerical model of future emissions.
   However, such mitigation could cease in response to changes in future
   climate, land use, or natural resource policies, or there could be CO2
   released from reservoirs of stored carbon. Model simulations suggest
   cumulative emissions could be similar, under scenarios where carbon
   storage ceases, or stored carbon is released, to emissions expected in
   the absence of any natural mitigation. If climate change is to be
   minimized, no-regrets approaches to natural mitigation should be
   considered (e.g., by reducing deforestation), as emissions targets that
   could limit warming to 1.5 degrees C cannot be met without mitigation of
   this magnitude. However, additional mitigation options should also be
   evaluated that can reduce CO2 emissions and remove CO2 from the air (and
   store it permanently).},

   Regression tree and importance analysis},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {717},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {River networks in subtropical agricultural hilly region become an
   inconvenient greenhouse gas (GHG, methane and nitrous oxide) source
   because of the influence of human activities, which has caused large
   uncertainties for refinement of national GHG inventories and their
   global budget. Based on field monitoring experiments at high temporal
   resolution, we employed regression tree and importance analysis to
   identify quantitatively factors that influence the diffusive flux of
   GHGs to provide a scientific basis for reducing GHG emissions and
   controlling regional carbon and nitrogen losses. The results indicate
   that significant spatiotemporal variation of methane (CH4) nitrous oxide
   (N2O) diffusion occurs in all the four reaches (W1, W2, W3 and W4) of
   Tuojia river networks. Among them, W1 contributed lowest CH4 (22.55 mu g
   C m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O (5.00 mu g N m(-2) h-1) diffusive flux than the
   other three (P < 0.05), while W4 offered highest CH4 (166.15 mu g C
   m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O (30.47 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) diffusive flux but with
   no statistically significant difference between W2 and W3 due to
   homogeneous extraneous nutrition loading into the two reaches. W4 also
   contributed largest cumulative flux of CH4 (14.55 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1))
   and N2O (2.69 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) in Tuojia River networks (P < 0.05).
   Furthermore, the regression tree and importance analysis indicate that,
   in the anaerobic environment, dissolved oxygen saturation controlled the
   production and diffusion for both CH4 and N2O. The findings of this
   investigation highlighted that decision support tools provide an
   effective pathway to enhance the GHG mitigation technology research in
   agroecosystems and simultaneously shed light on the global campaign on
   refinement of national GHG inventories as well as regional nutrient
   management. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Food systems and the communities they support are increasingly
   challenged by climate change and the need to arrest escalating threats
   through mitigation and adaptation. To ensure climate change mitigation
   strategies can be implemented effectively and to support substantial
   gains in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is, therefore, valuable
   to understand where climate-smart strategies might be used for best
   effect. We assessed mariculture in 171 coastal countries for
   vulnerabilities to climate change (12 indicators) and opportunities to
   deliver climate mitigation outcomes (nine indicators). We identified
   Northern America and Europe as having comparatively lower regional
   vulnerability and higher opportunity for impact on climate mitigation.
   Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand,
   Norway and the United States of America were identified as
   well-positioned to advance strategies linked to mariculture. However,
   the nature of vulnerabilities and opportunities within and between all
   regions and countries varied, due to the formation of existing
   mariculture, human development factors and governance capacity. Our
   analysis demonstrates that global discussion will be valuable to
   motivating climate-smart approaches associated with mariculture, but to
   ensure these solutions contribute to a resilient future, for industry,
   ecosystems and communities, local adaptation will be needed to address
   constraints and to leverage local prospects.This article is part of the

Abstract = {Methane (CH4), the second largest greenhouse gas emitted in China,
   hasn't been given enough attention in the country's policies and actions
   for addressing climate change. This paper aims to perform a bottom-up
   estimation and multi-regional input-output analysis for China's
   anthropogenic CH4 emissions from both production-based and
   consumption-based insights. As the world's largest CH4 emitter, China's
   total anthropogenic CH4 emissions in 2010 are estimated at 44.3 Tg and
   correspond to 1507.9 Mt CO2-eq by the lower global warming potential
   factor of 34. Energy activities as the largest contributor hold about
   half of the national total emissions, mainly from coal mining. Inherent
   economic driving factors covering consumption, investment and
   international exports play an important role in determining regional CH4
   emission inventories. Interregional transfers of embodied emissions via
   domestic trade are equivalent to half of the national total emissions
   from domestic production, of which two thirds are energy-related
   embodied emissions. Most central and western regions as net
   interregional CH4 exporters such as Shanxi and Inner Mongolia have
   higher direct emissions, while the eastern coastal regions as net
   interregional importers such as Guangdong and Jiangsu always have larger
   embodied emissions. Since China's CH4 emissions have significant
   contributions to global climate change, a national comprehensive action
   plan to reduce CH4 emissions should be designed by considering
   supply-side and demand-side emission characteristics, mitigation
   potentials and emission responsibilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {While there is little dissent in the scientific community that climate
   change directly correlates to human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions,
   action to reduce those emissions has not followed from the United States
   and many other governments around the world. Meanwhile, climate changes
   are already underway, and will continue to some degree even if emissions
   are drastically curtailed, thanks to emissions already in the
   atmosphere. Some countries and states are making their own plans to
   adapt to expected impacts including higher sea levels, more intense
   rainfall, droughts, heat waves, and loss of water supplies-and to reduce
   their local emissions. In this Global Forum, three experts highlight
   efforts by national and local governments in planning for 2100 and
   beyond. From the Netherlands, Arthur Mynett (2011); from Bangladesh,
   Saleemul Huq; and from California, Martha Krebs (2011). Over the months

Abstract = {In the last decade, the ocean has absorbed a quarter of the Earth's
   greenhouse gas emissions through the carbon (C) cycle, a naturally
   occurring process. Aspects of the ocean C cycle are now being
   incorporated into climate change mitigation and adaptation plans.
   Currently, too little is known about marine vertebrate C functions for
   their inclusion in policies. Fortunately, marine vertebrate biology,
   behavior, and ecology through the lens of C and nutrient cycling and
   flux is an emerging area of research that is rich in existing data. This
   review uses literature and trusted data sources to describe marine
   vertebrate C interactions, provides quantification where possible, and
   highlights knowledge gaps. Implications of better understanding the
   integral functions of marine vertebrates in the ocean C cycle include
   the need for consideration of these functions both in policies on
   nature-based climate change mitigation and adaptation, and in management
   of marine vertebrate populations.},

Volume = {38},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Part 1 of this review synthesizes recent research on status and climate
   vulnerability of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, and their
   contribution to addressing climate change (carbon cycle, adaptation,
   resilience). Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most
   carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much
   carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of
   rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon
   sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to
   prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and
   rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate
   adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland
   loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet
   climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores
   the policy and management realm from international to national,
   subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies
   reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate
   change science. Specific recommendations are made to capture synergies
   between wetlands and carbon cycle management, adaptation and resiliency
   to further enable researchers, policy makers and practitioners to
   protect wetland carbon and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem
   services.},

Title = {Mitigation choices impact carbon budget size compatible with low
   temperature goals},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Global-mean temperature increase is roughly proportional to cumulative
   emissions of carbondioxide (CO2). Limiting global warming to any level
   thus implies a finite CO2 budget. Due to geophysical uncertainties, the
   size of such budgets can only be expressed in probabilistic terms and is
   further influenced by non-CO2 emissions. We here explore how societal
   choices related to energy demand and specific mitigation options
   influence the size of carbon budgets for meeting a given temperature
   objective. We find that choices that exclude specific CO2 mitigation
   technologies (like Carbon Capture and Storage) result in greater costs,
   smaller compatible CO2 budgets until 2050, but larger CO2 budgets until
   2100. Vice versa, choices that lead to a larger CO2 mitigation potential
   result in CO2 budgets until 2100 that are smaller but can be met at
   lower costs. In most cases, these budget variations can be explained by
   the amount of non-CO2 mitigation that is carried out in conjunction with
   CO2, and associated global carbon prices that also drive mitigation of
   non-CO2 gases. Budget variations are of the order of 10\% around their
   central value. In all cases, limiting warming to below 2 degrees C thus
   still implies that CO2 emissions need to be reduced rapidly in the
   coming decades.},

Abstract = {New rules and regulations in the maritime sector are under discussion to
   reduce GHG emissions. Decision-makers are keen to understand the effects
   of such policies, to choose the more cost-effective ways to reduce
   emissions from ships. In this paper, we propose two alternative
   frameworks, based on a global and integrated perspective, to assess the
   cost-effectiveness of the policies under discussion and, therefore, to
   contribute to this debate. We use two possible mitigation actions as
   examples: fuel tax adoption and speed reduction. We also present the
   most utilized partial equilibrium models (based on trade models) and
   general equilibrium models to evaluate economic and environmental
   effects of policies. We also indicate the necessary components to
   develop a specific general equilibrium model for environmental policy
   evaluation in the maritime sector. Finally, we compare the advantages
   and disadvantages of each approach and present ways to calculate the
   relevant indicators to support the decisions on the best policies to be
   implemented.},

Title = {Understanding public complacency about climate change: adults' mental

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {80},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {213-238},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Public attitudes about climate change reveal a contradiction. Surveys
   show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also
   that reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sufficient to
   stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is
   greater evidence that climate change is harmful. US policymakers
   likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will
   cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce
   emissions. Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume climate change
   can be reversed quickly should harm become evident, underestimating
   substantial delays in the climate's response to anthropogenic forcing.
   We report experiments with highly educated adults - graduate students at
   MIT - showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and
   flow relationships, including mass balance principles, that lead to long
   response delays. GHG emissions are now about twice the rate of GHG
   removal from the atmosphere. GHG concentrations will therefore continue
   to rise even if emissions fall, stabilizing only when emissions equal
   removal. In contrast, most subjects believe atmospheric GHG
   concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere
   continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it. These beliefs -
   analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never
   overflow - support wait-and-see policies but violate conservation of
   matter. Low public support for mitigation policies may arise from
   misconceptions of climate dynamics rather than high discount rates or
   uncertainty about the impact of climate change. Implications for
   education and communication between scientists and nonscientists (the
   public and policymakers) are discussed.},

Title = {Harnessing Indigenous Technologies for Sustainable Management of Land,
   Water, and Food Resources Amidst Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Through advancements in technology humans have cultivated more food,
   used more fossil fuel reserves, polluted the environment, and caused
   climate change. This was not the case some few decades ago where
   indigenous technologies were used in exploiting natural resources.
   Unfortunately, the effects of climate change on the planet are no more
   distant reality. The melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme
   rainfall, and prolonged drought are already being experienced. These
   have affected water resources, land, and food security across the world.
   The limits of conventional climate change adaptation and mitigation
   strategies call for the integration of indigenous knowledge and
   technologies for tackling climate change issues. This is because of the
   importance that indigenous knowledge and technologies have for
   identifying the impacts and as well providing effective adaption and
   mitigation strategies to climate change. Thus, this chapter explores the
   potential of indigenous knowledge and technologies for the sustainable
   management of water, land, and food security amidst climate change. The
   applications of indigenous technologies and knowledge such as
   agroforestry, the use of sacred groves to conserve water, land, and
   biodiversity resources, and the practising of conservation-agriculture
   are discussed as solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water
   shortages, land degradation, and pollution. However, these indigenous
   technologies will be less useful in today's world if not harnessed. Thus
   also in this chapter, the scientific know-how available to improve the
   effectiveness of indigenous technologies for the sustainable use of
   water, land, and food resources have been identified (Robotics,
   sensors/detectors, internet of things) and discussed.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas provide important services and functions for social and
   economic activities. Damage due to sea level rise (SLR) is one of the
   serious problems anticipated and caused by climate change. In this
   study, we assess the global economic impact of inundation due to SLR by
   using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that incorporates
   detailed coastal damage information. The scenario analysis considers
   multiple general circulation models, socioeconomic assumptions, and
   stringency of climate change mitigation measures. We found that the
   global household consumption loss proportion will be 0.045\%, with a
   range of 0.027-0.066\%, in 2100. Socioeconomic assumptions cause a
   difference in the loss proportion of up to 0.035\% without greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions mitigation, the so-called baseline scenarios. The
   range of the loss proportion among GHG emission scenarios is smaller
   than the differences among the socioeconomic assumptions. We also
   observed large regional variations and, in particular, the consumption
   losses in low-income countries are, relatively speaking, larger than
   those in high-income countries. These results indicate that, even if we
   succeed in stabilizing the global mean temperature increase below 2
   degrees C, economic losses caused by SLR will inevitably happen to some
   extent, which may imply that keeping the global mean temperature
   increase below 1.5 degrees C would be worthwhile to consider.},

Title = {Impacts of and adaptation to climate change on the oil palm in Malaysia:
   a systematic review},

Abstract = {The interaction and the interplay of climate change with oil palm
   production in the Southeast Asia region are of serious concern. This
   particularly applies in Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest
   palm oil producer in the world. The anthropogenic activities and the
   agroecological practices in oil palm plantation, including excessive use
   of fertilisers, bush fire due to land clearing, and cultivation on
   peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate change featuring
   extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as infestation of
   pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production
   highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies.
   The study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm
   production and identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the
   impacts of climate change in Malaysia. This study was conducted a
   comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the
   contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The
   review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm
   production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation options were
   identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant and
   resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to
   enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of
   fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum
   tillage. The reviewed studies recommended the following to mitigate the
   adverse impacts of climate change: sustainable national policy on
   climate change, conservation of the existing carbon stock, effective
   management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, afforestation for carbon
   sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The agricultural production of ruminants is responsible for 24\% of
   global methane emissions, contributing 39\% of emissions of this
   greenhouse gas from the agricultural sector. Strategies to mitigate
   ruminant methanogenesis include the use of methanogen inhibitors. For
   example, the seaweeds Asparagopsis taxiformis and Asparagopsis armata
   included at low levels in the feed of cattle and sheep inhibit
   methanogenesis by up to 98\%, with evidence of improvements in feed
   utilisation efficiency. This has resulted in an increasing interest in
   and demand for these seaweeds globally. In response, research is
   progressing rapidly to facilitate Asparagopsis cultivation at large
   scale, and to develop aquaculture production systems to enable a high
   quality and consistent supply chain. In addition to developing robust
   strategies for sustainable production, it is important to consider and
   evaluate the benefits and risks associated with its production and
   subsequent use as an antimethanogenic feed ingredient for ruminant
   livestock. This review focuses on the relevant ruminal biochemical
   pathways, degradation, and toxicological risks associated with bromoform
   (CHBr3), the major active ingredient for inhibition of methanogenesis in
   Asparagopsis, and the effects that production of Asparagopsis and its
   use as a ruminant feed ingredient might have on atmospheric chemistry.},

Abstract = {Evidence of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have grown since
   pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70 \% between 1970 and 2004
   and with current climate change mitigation policies and related
   sustainable development practices, global GHG emissions will continue to
   grow over the next few decades. The increase in anthropogenic GHG
   concentrations is very likely causing the warming of the climate system
   since the mid-20th century, as evident from observations of increases in
   global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow
   and ice, and rising global average sea level. The climate system and the
   water cycle are closely linked, so that any change in one of these
   systems induces a change in the other. Yet, the implications of climate
   variability and climate change have not been fully considered in current
   water policy and decision-making frameworks. This is particularly true
   in developing countries, where the financial, human and ecological
   impacts are potentially greatest, and where water resources may be
   already highly stressed, but the capacity to cope and adapt is weakest.
   This chapter outlines the impact of climate change on water resources in
   Middle Eastern countries, and discusses potential adaptive measures in
   this respect, with emphasis on virtual water trade, as a
   non-conventional demand management option for water resources.},

Abstract = {Even though climate change involves much more than warming, it is the
   name given to a set of physical phenomena. It is a long-term change in
   weather patterns that characterises different regions of the world. The
   warming effect in the earth's atmosphere has dramatically increased
   through the influence of some heat-taping gases emitted by various human
   activities, especially fossil fuel burning. The more the input of such
   gases, the more will be the warming effect in the coming times. Global
   climate change is already visible in various parts of the larger
   ecosystems like forests, fisheries, biodiversity, and agriculture;
   however, it is now also influencing the supply of freshwater, human
   health, and well-being. This paper reviews climate change drivers, its
   global scenario, major global events, and assessing climate change
   impacts. The most daunting problem of economic and ecological risks,
   along with the threats to humanity, is also discussed. The paper further
   reviews the species' vulnerability to climate change and the heat waves
   and human migration vis-a-vis climate change. Climate change politics
   and coverage of climate change episodes in mass media is the special
   focus of this review that concludes with a few mitigation measures.},

Pages = {179-192},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {This paper examines the response of the climate of Small Island States
   (SIS) to transient increases in anthropogenic radiative forcing due to
   increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and/or
   sulfate aerosols using the data generated in a set of numerical
   experiments performed with a range of coupled atmosphere-ocean global
   climate models. Five of the 7 models considered in our validation
   exercise are found to have fair skill as regards their ability to
   simulate the broad features of present-day observed surface
   climatological features over the SIS in the Indian Ocean, the
   Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The
   transient experiments with these models, which include the time-varying
   future anthropogenic radiative forcings, have been used here to develop
   regional projections of future climate change. An area-averaged annual
   mean warming of ca 2degreesC or higher for the 2050s and ca 3degreesC or
   higher for the 2080s are projected for the SIS as a consequence of
   increases in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. In general,
   seasonal variations of the projected surface warming over the SIS are
   minimal. No significant change in diurnal temperature range is likely
   with an increase in surface temperatures. An increase in mean
   temperature would be accompanied by an increase in the frequency of
   extremely high temperatures. The aerosol forcing will only marginally
   reduce the surface warming. The models simulate only a marginal change
   (<10\%) in annual mean rainfall over most of the SIS, During the
   northern hemisphere summer, however, rainfall is projected to decline
   (except over Pacific Ocean islands). An increase in daily rainfall
   intensity leading to more heavy rainfall events is also projected. The
   projected changes in temperature and rainfall could disrupt the

Title = {A multi-criteria evaluation of policy instruments for climate change

Abstract = {Even as small island developing states (SIDS) like Trinidad and Tobago
   (T\&T) increase industrialization and grapple with the challenges of
   increased pollution, few studies provide guidance to policy makers of
   such countries on appropriate policy measures and instruments that can
   be implemented to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Here we apply a
   multi-criteria evaluation methodology to ascertain preferences for
   policy measures and instruments in the power generation sector. Four
   broad policy measures and twelve policy instruments are assessed on
   criteria of environmental performance, feasibility of implementation and
   political acceptability. This method proves useful in T\&T, since
   typical to many SIDS, the intensive data required by other policy
   assessment methods is unavailable. Results indicate little difference in
   preference among the four policy measures thereby indicating that a
   multi-pronged approach on several policy fronts is required. The most
   preferred policy instruments to operationalize measures included
   provision of subsidies for energy saving technologies, creating an
   industry wide carbon trading scheme and implementing a feed-in tariff to
   increase the use of renewable energy sources. This study therefore
   provides specific insights for policy makers in Trinidad and Tobago
   while also providing power generation sector specific guidance to other
   rapidly industrializing small island developing states. (C) 2011

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of integrated assessment of climate change is to put
   available knowledge together in order to evaluate what has been learned,
   policy implications, and research needs. This paper summarizes insights
   gained from five years of integrated assessment activity at Carnegie
   Mellon. After an introduction, in Section 2 we ask: who are the climate
   decision makers? We conclude that they are a diffuse and often divergent
   group spread all over the world whose decisions are primarily driven by
   local non-climate considerations. Insights are illustrated with results
   from the ICAM-2 model. In Section 3 we ask: what is the climate problem?
   In addition to the conventional answer, we note that in a democracy the
   problem is whatever voters and their elected representatives think it
   is. Results from studies of public understanding are reported. Several
   other specific issues that define the problem, including the treatment
   of aerosols and alternative indices for comparing greenhouse gases, are
   discussed. In Section 4 we discuss studies of climate impacts, focusing
   on coastal zones, the terrestrial biosphere and human health. Particular
   attention is placed on the roles of adaptation, value change, and
   technological innovation. In Section 5 selected policy issues are
   discussed. We conclude by noting that equity has received too little
   attention in past work. We argue that many conventional tools for policy
   analysis are not adequate to deal with climate problems. Values that
   change, and mixed levels of uncertainty, pose particularly important
   challenges for the future.},

Title = {What place for livestock on a re-greening earth?},

Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Humanity is quickly encroaching upon the finite limits of the biosphere.
   As our numbers and appetites grow, food supplies become less secure,
   reserves of clean energy dwindle, pools of freshwater evaporate, the
   atmosphere's capacity to absorb our emissions diminishes and space for
   human and biotic habitat grows scarce. In response, some are now asking
   whether the biosphere can support our growing herds of domesticated
   livestock, notably ruminants. My aim in this review is to contemplate
   the place of these animals in a world in need of re-greening, in more
   ways than one. In addressing this objective. I advance the premise that
   the place of livestock is examined best from the vantage of `land',
   broadly defined. Livestock have been implicated in many injurious
   processes: land use change, excess water use, nutrient excretion, fossil
   energy use, competition for food and emission of greenhouse gases. At
   the same time, they offer numerous benefits: producing food from human
   inedible sources, preserving ecosystem services, promoting perennials on
   croplands, recycling plant nutrients and providing social benefits. Thus
   livestock can be both stressors and benefactors to land and the aim of
   researchers should be to shift the net effect from stress to
   beneficence. To advance this goal, I offer seven questions, seen through
   the lenses of `systems', `place', `time' and `community', mostly to
   foster discourse. How do we better study whole systems? How do we better
   tune the systems to local land? How can we know long term consequences?
   How do we measure progress? How do we choose among trade-offs? How do we
   engage society? What will (or should) our successors' livestock systems
   look like? Humans and their livestock are intertwined to such an extent
   that their symbiosis will not likely soon be severed. Livestock offer
   many benefits to human society and often their place in ecosystems can
   be ecologically justified. But that does not mean that all ways of
   raising them are beneficial, nor that they necessarily fit everywhere.
   In coming decades, researchers, in concert with practitioners, consumers
   and policymakers, will need to show creativity, foresight and courage to
   envision new ways of melding animals into our ecosystems, not only to
   minimize harm, but to advance their re-greening.

Title = {Predicting and verifying the intended and unintended consequences of
   large-scale ocean iron fertilization},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {364},
Pages = {295-301},
Abstract = {Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is being considered as a strategy for
   mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. One model for
   implementation is the sale of carbon offsets. Modeling studies predict
   that OIF has the potential to produce a material difference in the rise
   of atmospheric CO2 over the next several decades, but this could only be
   attained by alteration of the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles of
   much of the world's oceans. The efficacy of OIF on this scale has not
   been proven. However, the consequences of successful implementation must
   be considered now, for 2 important reasons: (1) to determine if the
   environmental effects would be predictable and verifiable, and if so,
   acceptable; and (2) to establish whether the basis for valuing carbon
   offsets-an accurate audit of net reductions in cumulative greenhouse gas
   potential over 100 yr-can be met. Potential side-effects of widespread
   OIF that must be considered include a reduced supply of macronutrients
   to surface waters downstream of fertilized regions, increased emissions
   of the potent greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane, and changes in
   the extent or frequency of coastal hypoxia. Given the uncertainties
   inherent in ocean models, predictions of environmental effects must be
   backed up by measurements. Thus, to go forward with confidence that the
   effects of rising CO2 could indeed be mitigated through OIF over the
   next century, and to establish the foundations for auditing carbon
   offsets, it must be explicitly demonstrated that methods exist to
   predict and detect downstream effects of OIF against the background of
   both climate variability and global warming. We propose that until the
   side-effects of widespread OIF can be shown to be verifiable-and there
   is good reason to believe that they cannot - OIF should not be
   considered a viable technology for climate mitigation.},

Title = {Assessing climate changes impacts on tropical karst catchment:
   Implications on groundwater resource sustainability and management
   strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {582},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developing tailored management strategies to ensure the sustainability
   of groundwater resource under climatic and demographic changes is
   critical for tropical karst catchment, where relatively small watershed
   and highly porous soil make this natural resource highly susceptible and
   thus very sensitive to those changes. In this study, long term impacts
   of climate variability on groundwater recharge and discharge at Oemau
   spring, Rote Island, Indonesia were selected and investigated. Following
   calibration and validation of groundwater model using MODFLOW code,
   groundwater flow was simulated for the period of 2020-2090 under HadCM3
   global climate model (GCM) scenarios, using input data of weather
   variables downscaled by Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM). The
   reported analysis suggests that the sustainability of groundwater
   resources, which was evaluated by assessing the ability of the spring to
   supply water demand from irrigation requirement and domestic
   consumption, generally varies over the period and will be adversely
   affected by climate change during dry periods when the area is projected
   to variably experience supply shortage of around 29-67 L/s as a result
   of 5.24-23.63\% decrease of rainfall, 2.48-24.57\% reduction of
   recharge, and 2.53-22.80\% decrease of spring discharge, under HadCM3
   GCM scenarios. A subsequent comprehensive set of management strategies
   as palliative and adaptive efforts was proposed to be implemented by
   relevant stakeholders to assist the community dealing with water deficit
   during the dry periods. Three main adaptive strategies, namely
   socio-cultural, technical, and ecological measures, were proposed by
   incorporating physical and socio-economic characteristics of the area.
   This study presents a blueprint for assessing groundwater sustainability
   under climate change scenarios and developing tailored management
   strategies to cope with adverse impacts of climate change, which may
   become fundamental guidelines across other karst islands in the future.},

Title = {An assessment of mine methane mitigation and utilisation technologies},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ENERGY AND COMBUSTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-170},
Abstract = {Fugitive methane, emitted from coalmines around the world, represents
   approximately 8\% of the world's anthropogenic methane emissions that
   constitute a 17\% contribution to total anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions. Coal mine methane is a general description for all methane
   released prior to, during and after mining operations. As such, there is
   considerable variability in flow rate and composition of the various gas
   emissions during mining operations. At a typical gassy mine methane is
   emitted in three streams: (1) mine ventilation air (0.1-1\% CH4), (2)
   gas drained from the seam before mining (60-95\% CH4), and (3) gas
   drained from worked areas of the mine, e.g. goafs, (30-95\% CH4).
   Ventilation air methane contributes approximately 64\% of coalmine
   methane emissions from typical gassy coal mines.
   The existing and developing technologies for coal mine methane
   mitigation and utilisation are classified, with a discussion of the
   features of different technologies to identify potential technical
   issues for each technology when implemented at a mine site and to
   identify the best options for mine site applications. A technical
   assessment of these technologies for use at a Queensland coal mine is
   presented, with a preliminary economic assessment of some technologies
   that were determined to be technically feasible. The assessment is
   carried out on the basis of real mine methane emission data over about a
   1-year time frame. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Strong decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are required to meet the
   reduction trajectory resolved within the 2015 Paris Agreement. However,
   even these decreases will not avert serious stress and damage to life on
   Earth, and additional steps are needed to boost the resilience of
   ecosystems, safeguard their wildlife, and protect their capacity to
   supply vital goods and services. We discuss how well-managed marine
   reserves may help marine ecosystems and people adapt to five prominent
   impacts of climate change: acidification, sea-level rise,
   intensification of storms, shifts in species distribution, and decreased
   productivity and oxygen availability, as well as their cumulative
   effects. We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate
   change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering
   against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations,
   directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and
   limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-tech,
   cost-effective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits
   from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment
   and people into the future.},

   lobster, Homarus americanus},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) affects marine organisms through various
   physiological and biological processes, yet our understanding of how
   these translate to large-scale population effects remains limited. Here,
   we integrated laboratory-based experimental results on the life history
   and physiological responses to OA of the American lobster, Homarus
   americanus, into a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project future
   climate change effects on species distribution, abundance, and fisheries
   catch potential. Ocean acidification effects on juvenile stages had the
   largest stage-specific impacts on the population, while cumulative
   effects across life stages significantly exerted the greatest impacts,
   albeit quite minimal. Reducing fishing pressure leads to overall
   increases in population abundance while setting minimum size limits also
   results in more higher-priced market-sized lobsters (> 1 lb), and could
   help mitigate the negative impacts of OA and concurrent stressors
   (warming, deoxygenation). However, the magnitude of increased effects of
   climate change overweighs any moderate population gains made by changes
   in fishing pressure and size limits, reinforcing that reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions is most pressing and that climate-adaptive
   fisheries management is necessary as a secondary role to ensure
   population resiliency. We suggest possible strategies to mitigate
   impacts by preserving important population demographics.},

Abstract = {The assessment of local air pollution due to aircraft emissions at/near
   the airport is an important issue from the standpoint of environment and
   human health, but has not received due attention in China. In this
   paper, the pollutant emissions (i.e. HC, CO, NOx, SQ(x) and PM) from
   aircraft during landing and take-off (LTO) cycles at Nanjing Lukou
   Airport (NKG) in 2016 were investigated using an improved method, which
   considered the taxi-in and -out time calculated based on the real data
   from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), instead of using
   the referenced time recommended by ICAO. First, the pollutant emissions
   and their characteristics were studied from different perspectives.
   Second, two various mitigation measures of emissions were proposed, and
   the performance of emission reduction was analysed Our analysis shows
   that: (1) A320 and B738 emitted the largest emissions at NKG; (2)
   pollutants were mainly emitted during the taxi mode, followed by climb
   mode; (3) B738 had the lowest emissions per (seat.LTO) among all
   aircraft, while CRJ had the lowest emissions per unit LTO; (4)
   shortening the taxiing time and upgrading aircraft engines are both
   effective measures to mitigate pollutant emissions.},

Abstract = {Most ecological processes now show responses to anthropogenic climate
   change. In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are
   changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and
   phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food
   webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to
   the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including
   unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in
   wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In
   addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in
   flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic
   changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological
   processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing
   greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally
   on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.},

Title = {Towards a feasible and representative pan-African research
   infrastructure network for GHG observations},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There is currently a lack of representative, systematic and harmonised
   greenhouse gas (GHG) observations covering the variety of natural and
   human-altered biomes that occur in Africa. This impedes the long-term
   assessment of the drivers of climate change, in addition to their
   impacts and feedback loops at the continental scale, but also limits our
   understanding of the contribution of the African continent to the global
   carbon (C) cycle. Given the current and projected transformation of
   socio-economic conditions in Africa (i.e. the increasing trend of
   urbanisation and population growth) and the adverse impacts of climate
   change, the development of a GHG research infrastructure (RI) is needed
   to support the design of suitable mitigation and adaptation strategies
   required to assure food, fuel, nutrition and economic security for the
   African population. This paper presents the initial results of the
   EU-African SEACRIFOG project, which aims to design a GHG observation RI
   for Africa. The first stages of this project included the identification
   and engagement of key stakeholders, the definition of the conceptual
   monitoring framework and an assessment of existing infrastructural
   capacity. Feedback from stakeholder sectors was obtained through three
   Stakeholder Consultation Workshops held in Kenya, Ghana and Zambia. Main
   concerns identified were data quality and accessibility, the need for
   capacity building and networking among the scientific community, and
   adaptation to climate change, which was confirmed to be a priority for
   Africa. This feedback in addition to input from experts in the
   atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic thematic areas, facilitated the
   selection of a set of `essential variables' that need to be measured in
   the future environmental RI. An inventory of 47 existing and planned
   networks across the continent allowed for an assessment of the current
   RIs needs and gaps in Africa. Overall, the development of a harmonised
   and standardised pan-African RI will serve to address the continent's
   primary societal and scientific challenges through a potential
   cross-domain synergy among existing and planned networks at regional,
   continental and global scales.},

Title = {Review: New feeds and new feeding systems in intensive and
   semi-intensive forage-fed ruminant livestock systems},
Journal = {ANIMAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The contributions that ruminant livestock make to greenhouse gas and
   other pollutant emissions are well documented and of considerable policy
   and public concern. At the same time, livestock production continues to
   play an important role in providing nutrient-rich foodstuffs for many
   people, particularly in less developed countries. They also offer a
   means by which plants that cannot be digested by humans, e.g. grass, can
   be converted into human-edible protein. In this review, we consider
   opportunities to improve nutrient capture by ruminant livestock through
   new feeds and feeding systems concentrating on intensive and
   semi-intensive systems, which we define as those in which animals are
   given diets that are designed and managed to be used as efficiently as
   possible. We consider alternative metrics for quantifying efficiency,
   taking into account resource use at a range of scales. Mechanisms for
   improving the performance and efficiencies of both individual animals
   and production systems are highlighted. We then go on to map these to
   potential changes in feeds and feeding systems. Particular attention is
   given to improving nitrogen use efficiency and reducing enteric methane
   production. There is significant potential for the use of home-grown
   crops or novel feedstuffs such as insects and macroalgae to act as
   alternative sources of key amino acids and reduce reliance on
   unsustainably grown soybeans. We conclude by highlighting the extent to
   which climate change could impact forage-based livestock production and
   the need to begin work on developing appropriate adaptation strategies.

Title = {Environmental impacts of Brazil's Tucurui Dam: Unlearned lessons for
   hydroelectric development in Amazonia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {377-396},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Brazil's Tucurui Dam provides valuable lessons for improving
   decision-making on major public works in Amazonia and elsewhere.
   Together with social impacts, which were reviewed in a companion paper,
   the project's environmental costs are substantial. Monetary costs
   include costs of construction and maintenance and opportunity costs of
   natural resources (such as timber) and of the money invested by the
   Brazilian government. Environmental costs include forest loss, leading
   to both loss of natural ecosystems and to greenhouse gas emissions.
   Aquatic ecosystems are heavily affected by the blockage of fish
   migration and by creation of anoxic environments. Decay of vegetation
   left in the reservoir creates anoxic water that can corrode turbines, as
   well as producing methane and providing conditions for methylation of
   mercury. Defoliants were considered for removing forest in the
   submergence area but plans were aborted amid a public controversy.
   Another controversy surrounded impacts of defoliants used to prevent
   regrowth along the transmission line. Mitigation measures included
   archaeological and faunal salvage and creation of a ``gene bank{''} on
   an island in the reservoir. Decision-making in the case of Tucurui was
   virtually uninfluenced by environmental studies, which were done
   concurrently with construction. The dam predates Brazil's 1986
   requirement of an Environmental Impact Assessment. Despite limitations,
   research results provide valuable information for future darns.
   Extensive public-relations use of the research effort and of mitigation
   measures such as faunal salvage were evident. Decision-making was
   closely linked to the influence of construction firms, the military, and
   foreign financial interests in both the construction project and the use
   of the resulting electrical Fewer (most of which is used for aluminum
   smelting). Social and environmental costs received virtually no
   consideration when decisions were made, an outcome facilitated by a
   curtain of secrecy surrounding many aspects of the project. Despite
   improvements in Brazil's system of environmental impact assessment since
   the Tucurui reservoir was filled in 1984, many essential features of the
   decision-making system remain unchanged.},

Journal = {FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Bank of
   Canada, and several key financial institutions recently published a
   report examining transitional risks to the Canadian economy under
   various climate change scenarios. However, their results leave an
   important void with respect to the impact of physical risks and the
   associated costs of climate change for Canada, such as the loss of
   biodiversity, sea-level rise, and infrastructure damage due to fires and
   floods, etc. We fill this void by updating the Dynamic Integrated
   Climate and Economy model developed by 2018 Nobel Laureate William
   Nordhaus to project physical damages due to climate change for Canada.
   Our results illustrate stark differences in physical costs under various
   warming scenarios, highlighting the importance of taking action to
   mitigate climate change. We find that undertaking the required
   investments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions more than pays for
   itself in terms of avoided physical damage alone.},

Title = {GHGs Emissions and Sustainable Solid Waste Management},
Booktitle = {RECYCLING OF SOLID WASTE FOR BIOFUELS AND BIO-CHEMICALS},
Series = {Environmental Footprints and Eco-design of Products and Processes},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {55-85},
Abstract = {In the 21st century, global warming and climate change are among the
   greatest environmental challenges and humanitarian crisis. Globally,
   annual greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions from solid waste disposal sites
   is estimated to be approximately a quarter of total anthropogenic
   methane emission. Integrated solid waste management, therefore, provides
   significant opportunities to control environmental pollution and
   minimize the negative impacts of global climate change. This chapter
   illustrates the current status of global GHGs emission in relationship
   with population growth and solid waste generation. Mathematic models
   used to quantify GHGs generated from the waste sector as the zero-order
   model (i.e., SWANA, German EPER and IPCC Default Method) and the
   first-order model (i.e., TNO, LandGEM, IPCC First-Order Decay; FOD) are
   explained including application to certain inventory in selected
   countries. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which involves the
   cradle-to-grave concept, environmental burden from global warming and
   selected case studies are described and applied to assess GHGs emissions
   from various solid waste management options such as recycling,
   composting, sanitary landfilling, anaerobic digestion, incineration,
   mechanical biological treatment (MBT), source reduction, and utilization
   and application of biochar. Existing solid waste management practices
   and innovative options to achieve GHGs mitigation and community
   adaptation including resiliency are presented. Lessons learned and best
   practices in solid waste management from Thailand (i.e., Bangkok
   Kamphaeng Sean West: Landfill Gas to Electricity Project) and from other
   countries (i.e., GHGs mitigation project: MBT plant in Gaobeidian, Hebei
   province, People's Republic of China; municipal solid waste composting
   project in Ikorodu, Lagos State, Federal Republic of Nigeria; and
   gasification, landfill gas and anaerobic digestion in Bali, Indonesia)
   are further discussed.},

Title = {Managing Water and Soils to Achieve Adaptation and Reduce Methane
   Emissions and Arsenic Contamination in Asian Rice Production},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Rice production is susceptible to damage from the changes in temperature
   and rainfall patterns, and in the frequency of major storm events that
   will accompany climate change. Deltaic areas, in which millions of
   farmers cultivate from one to three crops of rice per year, are
   susceptible also to the impacts of a rising sea level, submergence
   during major storm events, and saline intrusion into groundwater and
   surface water resources. In this paper, I review the current state of
   knowledge regarding the potential impacts of climate change on rice
   production and I describe adaptation measures that involve soil and
   water management. In many areas, farmers will need to modify crop
   choices, crop calendars, and soil and water management practices as they
   adapt to climate change. Adaptation measures at the local, regional, and
   international levels also will be helpful in moderating the potential
   impacts of climate change on aggregate rice production and on household
   food security in many countries. Some of the changes in soil and water
   management and other production practices that will be implemented in
   response to climate change also will reduce methane generation and
   release from rice fields. Some of the measures also will reduce the
   uptake of arsenic in rice plants, thus addressing an important public
   health issue in portions of South and Southeast Asia. Where feasible,
   replacing continuously flooded rice production with some form of aerobic
   rice production, will contribute to achieving adaptation objectives,
   while also reducing global warming potential and minimizing the risk of
   negative health impacts due to consumption of arsenic contaminated rice.},

Title = {Review of geoengineering approaches to mitigating climate change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {898-907},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Geoengineering, which is the intentional large-scale manipulation of the
   environment, has been suggested as an effective means of mitigating
   global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In this
   paper, we will review and assess technical and theoretical aspects of
   land-based, atmosphere-based, ocean-based and space-based geoengineering
   schemes as well as their potential impacts on global climate and
   ecosystem. Most of the proposed geoengineering schemes carried out on
   land or in the ocean are to use physical, chemical or biological
   approaches to remove atmospheric CO2. These schemes are able to only
   sequester an amount of atmospheric CO2 that is small compared with
   cumulative anthropogenic emissions. Most of geoengineering schemes
   carried out in the atmosphere or space are based on increasing planetary
   albedo. These schemes have relatively low costs and short lead times for
   technical implementation, and can act rapidly to reduce temperature
   anomalies caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The costs and benefits of
   geoengineering are likely to vary spatially over the planet with some
   countries and regions gaining considerably while others may be faced
   with a worse set of circumstances than would be the case without
   geoengineering. Since current research on geoengineering is limited and
   various international treaties may limit some geoengineering experiments
   in the real world, the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project
   (GeoMIP) provides a framework of coordinated experiments for all earth
   system modeling groups to test geoengineering schemes. However, these
   experiments used on a global scale have difficulty with accurate
   resolution of regional and local impacts, so future research on
   geoengineering is expect to be done by combining earth system models
   with regional climate models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Production of alternative marine fuels in Brazil: An integrated
   assessment perspective},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {219},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {This study aims to provide an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)
   perspective of the production and distribution of alternative marine
   fuels in Brazilian ports, considering the International Maritime
   Organization (IMO) emission reduction target for 2050 (IMO2050).
   Although other mitigation measures are available, it is likely that
   alternative fuels will be required, implying additional costs and
   entailing relevant impacts on other energy chains and land use. Hence,
   the national IAM BLUES model is adapted to represent the relevant part
   of the international shipping sector. A set of scenarios is developed
   considering different fuel alternatives, demand assumptions and national
   mitigation targets. Findings show that taking into account emissions of
   CO2 only or of all greenhouse gases (GHGs) within the IMO strategy
   significantly impacts the optimal technological portfolio. Furthermore,
   achieving the IMO2050 goal without considering a national
   decarbonization strategy may result in potential spillovers. The intense
   use of the energy sector could partially compromise the gains obtained
   by maritime decarbonization or even surpass it. Therefore, only an
   integrated mitigation strategy would lead to more effective
   decarbonization of the entire marine supply. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Heat stress is one of the most severe climate threats to human society
   in a future warmer world. The situation is further exacerbated in urban
   areas by urban heat islands (UHIs). Because the majority of world's
   population is projected to live in cities, there is a pressing need to
   find effective solutions for the heat stress problem. We use a climate
   model to investigate the effectiveness of various urban heat mitigation
   strategies: cool roofs, street vegetation, green roofs, and reflective
   pavement. Our results show that by adopting highly reflective roofs,
   almost all the cities in the United States and southern Canada are
   transformed into ``white oases{''} - cold islands caused by cool roofs
   at midday, with an average oasis effect of -3.4K in the summer for the
   period 2071-2100, which offsets approximately 80\% of the greenhouse gas
   (GHG) warming projected for the same period under the RCP4.5 scenario. A
   UHI mitigation wedge consisting of cool roofs, street vegetation, and
   reflective pavement has the potential to eliminate the daytime UHI plus
   the GHG warming.},

Title = {United States policy for mitigating global climate change},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {309-314},
Abstract = {The primary objective of this paper is to explain current U.S. policy on
   global climate change. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) efforts to
   implement this policy will be described. A secondary objective of this
   paper is to discuss from a U.S. perspective the social and political
   efforts which must be initiated in order for ocean storage of CO2 to be
   considered as a viable CO2 mitigation option. The fact that the
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) has not been successful in
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now recognized. Thus, U.S. policy
   has shifted towards the development of binding medium-term emissions
   targets and long-term atmosphere concentration goals. The U.S. believes
   these goals can be accomplished through the adoption of cost-effective
   joint implementation agreements and international emissions trading
   mechanisms. Studies are currently underway to assess specific targets
   and timetables for emissions reductions. Voluntary efforts on the part
   of U.S. industry have proven to be extremely successful in reducing U.S.
   CO2 emissions. The U.S. electric utility industry has taken the lead in
   voluntarily lowering greenhouse gas emissions under the DOE Climate
   Challenge Program. As of August, 1996, nearly 600 utility participants,
   accounting for over 60\% of electric power generation in the U.S., have
   joined the program. Areas of research interest to DOE include the
   development of high efficiency advanced power generation cycles and CO2
   sequestration technology. The U.S. currently spends \$1.6 billion on
   understanding global climate phenomena and only \$1.6 million on CO2
   mitigation research. A number of socio-political considerations must be
   looked at in assessing the feasibility of ocean storage of CO2.
   Developing public trust appears to be a major concern in establishing
   the acceptability of ocean storage. Uncertainties in the effects of CO2
   on marine life, potential safety hazards associated with pipelining, and
   ship transport of CO2 are all issues which must be dealt with as soon as
   possible. Some hidden costs associated with ocean disposal will also be
   discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The tourism and hospitality industry is a worldwide known
   trillion-dollar industry and a major economic generator for several
   economies. Despite a positive economic contributor, the challenges of
   the tourism industry cannot be overlooked. The tourism industry is right
   now definitely more involved on the broader aspects of sustainable
   tourism but nevertheless still contributes 8\% of the GHG emissions
   globally. This work aims at identifying and addressing the main
   contributing areas responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions for the
   hotel industry in Mauritius. A quantitative approach based on an adapted
   framework of the hotel carbon measurement initiative (HCMI) was used to
   collect data from four hotels with different ratings and which were
   selected through convenience sampling. Land use for buildings, energy
   consumption and emissions, refrigerants being used in the hotel, water
   consumption and wastes being produced are researched as major
   contributors of GHG from the hotels and these were captured and
   analyzed. Comparatively, the findings revealed that the carbon footprint
   for 4-star, 5-star and 5-star plus hotels were found to be lower than
   the average carbon footprint of other hotels of similar categories
   worldwide. However, for 3-star hotels, the latter was found to be
   higher. Plausible recommendations were made accordingly to reduce carbon
   emissions for each hotel type.},

Title = {Future changes in wind energy resource over the Northwest Passage based

Abstract = {The preferential use of renewable energy sources such as wind power has
   been proposed as one of the most effective strategies in reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector. However, wind energy
   resources are vulnerable to climate change, which might have a huge
   impact on the area under consideration. In this research, we used the
   wind speed data obtained from the seven coupled global climate models in
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to
   quantitatively analyze the differences in wind energy resource (WER)
   between the future and the historical period, geared toward
   understanding the impact of climate change on wind energy sources.
   Relevant results show that the future WER would decreases below 20\% in
   the region south of the Northwest Passage, while would significantly
   increase in the north region of 72 degrees N (specifically in the
   Beaufort Sea). Further, reports predict that by the end of the 21st
   century, if no interventions are made to mitigate greenhouse gas
   emissions, the northern region's WER would increase even more with some
   grid points exceeding 30\% and have a significant growth trend, but at
   the same time the intra-annual variability in these region would also
   increase significantly with some grid points exceeding 140\% of that in
   the historical period. Moreover, the maximum wind speed values would
   encounter a noteworthy increase of up to 20\%, which will bring great
   challenge to the development of wind energy in these region. Although
   the current models still have great uncertainties in the future climate
   prediction, our work still has certain guiding significance for the
   future development of wind energy over the Northwest Passage.},

Title = {A review of assessment methods for the urban environment and its energy

Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},

Abstract = {The current climate change is calling for a drastic reduction of energy
   demand as well as of greenhouse gases. Besides this, cities also need to
   adapt to face the challenges related to climate change. Cities, with
   their complex urban texture and fabric, can be represented as a diverse
   ecosystem that does not have a clear and defined boundary. Multiple
   software tools that have been developed, in recent years, for assessment
   of urban climate, building energy demand, the outdoor thermal comfort
   and the energy systems. In this review, we, however, noted that these
   tools often address only one or two of these urban planning aspects.
   There is nonetheless an intricate link between them. For instance, the
   outdoor comfort assessment has shown that there is a strong link between
   biometeorology and architecture and urban climate. Additionally, to
   address the challenges of the energy transition, there will be a
   convergence of the energy needs in the future with an energy nexus
   regrouping the energy demand of urban areas. It is also highlighted that
   the uncertainty related to future climatic data makes urban adaptation
   and mitigation strategies complex to implement and to design given the
   lack of a comprehensive framework. We thus conclude by suggesting the
   need for a holistic interface to take into account this
   multi-dimensional problem. With the help of such a platform, a positive
   loop in urban design can be initiated leading to the development of low
   carbon cities and/or with the use of blue and green infrastructure to
   have a positive impact on the mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Since 2006 the scientific community in California, in cooperation with
   resource managers, has been conducting periodic statewide studies about
   the potential impacts of climate change on natural and managed systems.
   This Special Issue is a compilation of revised papers that originate
   from the most recent assessment that concluded in 2009. As with the 2006
   studies that influenced the passage of California's landmark Global
   Warming Solutions Act (AB32), these papers have informed policy
   formulation at the state level, helping bring climate adaptation as a
   complementary measure to mitigation. We provide here a brief
   introduction to the papers included in this Special Issue focusing on
   how they are coordinated and support each other. We describe the common
   set of downscaled climate and sea-level rise scenarios used in this
   assessment that came from six different global climate models (GCMs) run
   under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios: B1 (low emissions) and A2
   (a medium-high emissions). Recommendations for future state assessments,
   some of which are being implemented in an on-going new assessment that
   will be completed in 2012, are offered.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Desalination is often considered an approach for mitigating water
   stress. Despite the abundance of saline water worldwide, additional
   energy consumption and increased costs present barriers to widespread
   deployment of desalination as a municipal water supply. Specific energy
   consumption (SEC) is a common measure of the energy use in desalination
   processes, and depends on many operational and water quality factors. We
   completed multiple linear regression and relative importance statistical
   analyses of factors affecting SEC using both small-scale meta-data and
   municipal-scale empirical data to predict the energy consumption of
   desalination. Statistically significant results show water quality and
   initial year of operations to be significant and important factors in
   estimating SEC, explaining over 80\% of the variation in SEC. More
   recent initial year of operations, lower salinity raw water, and higher
   salinity product water accurately predict lower values of SEC. Economic
   analysis revealed a weak statistical relationship between SEC and cost
   of water production. Analysis of associated greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions revealed important considerations of both electricity source
   and SEC in estimating the GHG-related sustainability of desalination.
   Results of our statistical analyses can aid decision-makers by
   predicting the SEC of desalination to a reasonable degree of accuracy
   with limited data.},

Title = {Considering Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Power System
   Expansion Planning for Europe and North Africa Using Multi-Objective
   Optimization},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We integrate life cycle indicators for various technologies of an energy
   system model with high spatiotemporal detail and a focus on Europe and
   North Africa. Using multi-objective optimization, we calculate a pareto
   front that allows us to assess the trade-offs between system costs and
   life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of future power systems.
   Furthermore, we perform environmental ex-post assessments of selected
   solutions using a broad set of life cycle impact categories. In a system
   with the least life cycle GHG emissions, the costs would increase by
   similar to 63\%, thereby reducing life cycle GHG emissions by similar to
   82\% compared to the cost-optimal solution. Power systems mitigating a
   substantial part of life cycle GHG emissions with small increases in
   system costs show a trend towards a deployment of wind onshore,
   electricity grid and a decline in photovoltaic plants and Li-ion
   storage. Further reductions are achieved by the deployment of
   concentrated solar power, wind offshore and nuclear power but lead to
   considerably higher costs compared to the cost-optimal solution. Power
   systems that mitigate life cycle GHG emissions also perform better for
   most impact categories but have higher ionizing radiation, water use and
   increased fossil fuel demand driven by nuclear power. This study shows
   that it is crucial to consider upstream GHG emissions in future
   assessments, as they represent an inheritable part of total emissions in
   ambitious energy scenarios that, so far, mainly aim to reduce direct CO2
   emissions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {To mitigate the growing threat of climate change and develop novel
   technologies that can eliminate carbon dioxide, the most abundant
   greenhouse gas derived from the flue gas stream of the fossil fuel-fired
   power stations, is momentous. The development of carbon capture and
   sequestration-based technologies may play a significant role in this
   regard. Carbon fixation mostly occurs by photosynthesizing plants as
   well as photo and chemoautotrophic microbes that turn the atmospheric
   carbon dioxide into organic materials via their enzymes. Biofuel can
   offer a sustainable solution for carbon mitigation. The pragmatic
   implementation of biofuel production processes is neither cost-effective
   nor has been proven safe over the long term. Searching for ways to
   enhance biofuel generation by the employment of genetic engineering is
   vital. Carbon biosequestration can help to curb the greenhouse effect.
   In addition, new genomic approaches, which are able to use gene-splicing
   biotechnology techniques and recombinant DNA technology to produce
   genetically modified organisms, can contribute to improvement in
   sustainable and renewable biofuel and biomaterial production from
   microorganisms. Biopolymers, Biosurfactants, and Biochars are suggested
   as sustainable future trends. This study aims to pave the way for
   implementing biotechnology methods to capture carbon and decrease the
   demand and consumption of fossil fuels as well as the emissions of
   greenhouse gases. Having a better image of microorganisms' potential
   role in carbon capture and storage can be prolific in developing
   powerful techniques to reduce CO2 emissions.},

Abstract = {Since the conclusion of the 2014 Climate Summit in New York and the 21st
   Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, China has been actively
   advancing its national policies on climate change mitigation and
   adaptation since more unpredictable extreme weather events are expected,
   which may incur a heavy cost in terms of economics and public health.
   Since China is still in the process of urbanisation, the greatest
   challenge it faces is finding a balance between economic growth and
   keeping carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emission rates at a manageable
   level. Cities in China play a key role in the implementation of the
   central policies and make concrete actions in response to climate
   change. With reference to a series of recent policy papers and action
   plans as the background, this paper attempts to provide a critical
   overview of China's climate change action plans from the national to the
   city and urban level. It seeks to understand whether the proposed
   responses to climate change and strategies for actions on greening and
   air corridors for cities and urban areas are appropriate. It is found
   that for China to advance its urban climatic adaptation strategy there
   is a need for (1) urban data, (2) a cross-disciplinary impact
   assessment, and (3) the development of a market and policy
   transformation mechanism. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {The Proteobacterial Methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b
   Remodels Membrane Lipids in Response to Phosphate Limitation},

Abstract = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and its
   concentration has continued to increase steadily in recent decades. In
   the natural environment, bacteria known as methanotrophs help mitigate
   methane emissions at no cost to human beings.
   Methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and its
   concentration has continued to increase in recent decades. Aerobic
   methanotrophs, bacteria that use methane as the sole carbon source, are
   an important biological sink for methane, and they are widely
   distributed in the natural environment. However, relatively little is
   known on how methanotroph activity is regulated by nutrients,
   particularly phosphorus (P). P is the principal nutrient constraining
   plant and microbial productivity in many ecosystems, ranging from
   agricultural land to the open ocean. Using a model methanotrophic
   bacterium, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, we demonstrate here that
   this bacterium can produce P-free glycolipids to replace membrane
   phospholipids in response to P limitation. The formation of the
   glycolipid monoglucuronic acid diacylglycerol requires plcP-agt genes
   since the plcP-agt mutant is unable to produce this glycolipid. This
   plcP-agt-mediated lipid remodeling pathway appears to be important for
   M. trichosporium OB3b to cope with P stress, and the mutant grew
   significantly slower under P limitation. Interestingly, comparative
   genomics analysis shows that the ability to perform lipid remodeling
   appears to be a conserved trait in proteobacterial methanotrophs;
   indeed, plcP is found in all proteobacterial methanotroph genomes, and
   plcP transcripts from methanotrophs are readily detectable in
   metatranscriptomics data sets. Together, our study provides new insights
   into the adaptation to P limitation in this ecologically important group
   of bacteria. IMPORTANCE Methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the
   atmosphere, and its concentration has continued to increase steadily in
   recent decades. In the natural environment, bacteria known as
   methanotrophs help mitigate methane emissions at no cost to human
   beings. However, relatively little is known regarding how methane
   oxidation activity in methanotrophs is regulated by soil nutrients,
   particularly phosphorus. Here, we show that methanotrophs can modify
   their membrane in response to phosphorus limitation and that the ability
   to change membrane lipids is important for methanotroph activity. Genome
   and metatranscriptome analyses suggest that such an adaptation strategy
   appears to be strictly conserved in all proteobacterial methanotrophs
   and is used by these bacteria in the natural environment. Together, our
   study provides a plausible molecular mechanism for better understanding
   the role of phosphorus on methane oxidation in the natural environment.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Island regions are at a heightened level of vulnerability to climate
   change impacts and recently a great degree of political attention has
   been given to planning low-carbon economic strategies for Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS). To develop useful mitigation strategies, an
   understanding of greenhouse gas emissions currently attributable to
   various social sectors is necessary. We use consumption-based life cycle
   accounting techniques to assess the carbon footprint of typical
   households within the US Virgin Islands. We find the average carbon
   footprint in the territory to be 13 tCO(2)e per year per capita, roughly
   35\% less than the average US per capita footprint. Also, electricity
   and food are much larger contributors to total footprint than in the US.
   Results highlight scope for behavioral and technological changes that
   could significantly reduce the footprint. The model has been developed
   into an open access online tool for educational purposes. (c) 2012

Abstract = {Increasing temperatures and sea levels, changing precipitation patterns
   and more extreme weather pose severe threats for vulnerable communities,
   ecosystems, and livelihoods in cities of developing countries. Realizing
   these threats has heightened scholarly inquiry on future risk trends of
   climate change and adaptation strategies in the countries of Global
   South and North. However, most studies are based on data of North
   America, Europe, and Asia. There is minimal documentation of adaptation
   strategies to mitigate the risk of extreme weather in cities of
   Sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, this study addresses this need by examining
   the factors influencing individual and household adaptation strategies
   to climate risk in Port Harcourt Metropolis, Nigeria. Data was collected
   from 384 randomly selected household heads in different residential
   densities of the city. Household socioeconomic and demographic
   attributes, awareness of climate change and factors influencing their
   adaptation strategies to climate risk were assessed using descriptive
   and inferential statistics. The study showed that adaptation strategies
   adopted were reactive rather than anticipatory and varied in magnitude
   according to the different residential densities. Recommendations
   emanating from the study include integrating and implementing climate
   change adaptation policies and embarking on a rigorous awareness
   campaign to ease households' vulnerability and augment their climate
   change absorptive, adaptive, and transformative abilities in the city.},

Title = {How soil ion stress and type influence the flooding adaptive strategies
   of Phragmites australis and Bolboschoenus planiculmis in temperate
   saline-alkaline wetlands?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {771},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Soil saline-alkaline stress and flooding extremes have been projected to
   be the main factors influencing the degradation of marsh plants in
   wetlands worldwide, which would affect their ecological functions (i.e.
   food source for migrating birds). Plants cope with flooding either by
   escaping from below water through shoot elongation or by remaining
   quiescent until water subsides. However, little is known about the
   adaptive strategies of Phragmites australis and Bolboschoenus
   planiculmis to flooding combined with salinity-alkalinity, which are the
   key environmental filters in Western Songnen Plain, China. Accordingly,
   this study investigated the adaptive strategies of P. australis and B.
   planiculmis subjected to the interacting effects of flooding and soil
   ion stress under field and greenhouse conditions. Results showed that
   the two species adopted different strategies to survive flooding. P.
   australis exhibited an escape strategy because of leaf and shoot
   elongation with increasing flooding depth whereas B. planiculmis became
   quiescent with no or deceased leaf and shoot elongation and biomass
   accumulation. High soil ion stress changed the flooding adaptive
   strategy of P. australis to a quiescence strategy, whereas B.
   planiculmis remained quiescent with increasing flooding depth at each
   soil ion content. The strategies of the two species were changed by
   alkaline ion stress but not by saline ion stress, and they exhibited
   different adaptive responses. High alkaline ion stress induced P.
   australis to remain quiescent with increasing flooding depth, whereas
   low alkaline ion stress promoted B. planicumis to escape from below
   water, probably due to the buffer effect of low alkaline ion contents
   outside the roots probably. Hence, P. australis and B. planicumis might
   adopt the quiescence strategy with increasing degree of soil
   salinization and alkalization under high greenhouse gas emissions
   scenarios in Western Songnen Plain, which may lead to severe degradation
   of the two kinds of marshes in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The global environment is a complex and dynamic system. Earth system
   modeling is needed to help understand changes in interacting subsystems,
   elucidate the influence of human activities, and explorepossible future
   changes. Integrated assessment of environment and human development is
   arguably the mast difficult and most important ``systems{''} problem
   faced. To illustrate this approach, we present results from the
   integrated global system model (IGSM), which consists of coupled
   submodels addressing economic development, atmospheric chemistry,
   climate dynamics, and ecosystem processes. An uncertainty analysis
   implies that without mitigation policies, the global average surface
   temperature may rise between 3.5 degrees C and 7.4 degrees C from
   1981-2000 to 2091-2100(90\% confidence limits). Polar temperatures,
   absent policy, are projected to rise from about 6.4 degrees C to 14
   degrees C (90\% confidence limits). Similar analysis of four
   increasingly stringent climate mitigation policy cases involving
   stabilization of greenhouse gases at various levels indicates that the
   greatest effect of these policies is to lower the probability of extreme
   changes. The IGSM is also used to elucidate potential unintended
   environmental consequences of renewable energy at large scales. There
   are significant reasons for attention to climate adaptation in addition
   to climate mitigation that earth system models can help inform. These
   models can also be applied to evaluate whether ``climate engineering{''}
   is a viable option or a dangerous diversion. We must prepare young
   people to address this issue: The problem of preserving a habitable
   planet will engage present and future generations. Scientists must
   improve communication if research is to inform the public and policy
   makers better.},

Abstract = {Climate change can be mitigated simultaneously by two ways, maintaining
   the greenhouse gases below the carbon budget and conserving marine and
   terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. Marine vegetation (e.g.
   mangrove and seagrass meadows) is less than 0.5\% of the total marine
   area and narrower compared to terrestrial vegetation. However, marine
   vegetation has high net primary production (NPP) and contributes more
   than 50\% of the global carbon burial in its substrate and biomass.
   Indonesia has 3,301,848 ha of mangrove area, the widest in South-East
   Asia. The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are 150,693 ha, the second
   widest seagrass area in the world. These two ecosystems are important
   for the global carbon cycle due to their high capacity for carbon
   sequestration. Considering this potential, it is necessary to promote a
   strategic scientific-based policy of conservation of marine vegetation
   areas for both local and national stakeholders. The policies consist of:
   1) to implement the National/Local Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse
   Gas Emissions (RAN/D GRK); 2) to manage the land use changes that
   contribute 67\% of total national emissions; 3) to determine coastal
   ecosystem protection areas that are considering the province policy in
   the Plan for Zoning of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (RZWP3K); 4) to
   rehabilitate terrestrial vegetation, coastal ecosystems, and aquatic
   conservation areas (President Regulation no 61/2011); and 5) to strictly
   carry out the national policy for green open space (Government
   Regulation no 26/2008).},

   Microdata evidence 2014-2017},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Emissions have been a critical concern for the shipping sector, calling
   for climate mitigation measures to be implemented in this field
   urgently. It is therefore useful to understand the factors that
   influence the relevant empirical trends so that policies can be better
   tailored to address the climate challenges. Given the high reliance on
   fossil fuels, this paper has focused on the energy consumption from
   international shipping, by examining 6 factors across product types and
   shipping routes. This is based on comprehensive microdata of almost all
   vessels in the world over 2014-2017. The study finds that improvements
   in energy intensity is consistent across product types and shipping
   routes, reinforcing the importance of energy efficiency as a key climate
   mitigation measure. However, shifts in freight transport activity across
   different regions have offset gains in energy efficiency and was the
   most dominant factor contributing to an increase in energy consumption.
   Monitoring of the transport structure effect is critical for progress
   tracking and the potential of this effect to alter energy consumption
   should also be factored into emission projections.},

Abstract = {Climate change is happening and already manifested in a range of ways,
   including: global warming, rising sea levels, floods, heat-waves,

   energy generation and it is increasing throughout the world. Fossil fuel
   burning results in carbon emissions. On the basis of the most recent

Abstract = {P>Climate change may be considered a natural disaster evolving in slow
   motion on a global scale. Increasing storm intensities, shifting
   rainfall patterns, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and other
   manifold alterations are being experienced around the world. Climate has
   never been constant in any location, but human-induced changes
   associated with greenhouse gases and fossil fuel use are new and rapidly
   shifting conditions for rural communities and regions across the planet.
   Rural sociologists have long been carving out the contours of this topic
   through research on family well-being, rural livelihoods, community, and
   the environment. Now climate change and subsequent policy responses
   present a new and fundamental source of social change. The purpose of
   this article is to assess lines of research and theory that consider and
   direct our understanding of the impacts of climate change, the ways it
   might be mitigated, and the coping strategies of rural people and
   communities that are both victims and perpetrators in the global
   realignment. As climate-change impacts and policy responses begin to
   impinge on rural populations, the first line of resistance and
   participation will be the rural community. The distribution of rewards
   from climate-change mitigation is broad and diffuse; the distribution of
   costs, compromised livelihoods, and community disruption often is
   focused.},

Abstract = {This study illustrates a methodology to assess the economic impacts of
   climate change at a city scale and benefits of adaptation, taking the
   case of sea level rise and storm surge risk in the city of Copenhagen,
   capital of Denmark. The approach is a simplified catastrophe risk
   assessment, to calculate the direct costs of storm surges under
   scenarios of sea level rise, coupled to an economic input-output (IO)
   model. The output is a risk assessment of the direct and indirect
   economic impacts of storm surge under climate change, including, for
   example, production and job losses and reconstruction duration, and the
   benefits of investment in upgraded sea defences. The simplified
   catastrophe risk assessment entails a statistical analysis of storm
   surge characteristics, geographical-information analysis of population
   and asset exposure combined with aggregated vulnerability information.
   For the city of Copenhagen, it is found that in absence of adaptation,
   sea level rise would significantly increase flood risks. Results call
   for the introduction of adaptation in long-term urban planning, as one
   part of a comprehensive strategy to manage the implications of climate
   change in the city. Mitigation policies can also aid adaptation by
   limiting the pace of future sea level rise.},

Title = {Economic optimisation of European supply chains for CO2 capture,

   mitigation measures},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},

Volume = {223},
Pages = {401-415},

Abstract = {European large stationary sources are currently emitting more than 1.4
   Gt of CO2 every year. A significant decrease in greenhouse gases
   emissions cannot be achieved without carbon capture and sequestration
   (CCS) technologies. However, although being practiced for over 30 years,
   CO2 transportation is intrinsically characterised by the risk of
   leakage. This study proposes to assess and tackle this issue within the
   CCS design problem, by proposing a spatially explicit mixed integer
   linear programming approach for the economic optimisation of a European
   supply chain for carbon capture, transport and geological storage, where
   societal risk assessment is formally incorporated within the modelling
   framework. Post-combustion, oxy-fuel combustion and pre-combustion are
   considered as technological options for CO2 capture, whereas both
   pipelines (inshore and offshore) and ships are taken into account as
   transport means. Both inland-inshore and offshore injection options are
   available for carbon geological sequestration. Risk mitigation measures
   are considered in the design of the transport network. The overall
   supply chain is economically optimised for different minimum carbon
   reduction scenarios. Results demonstrate that accounting for societal
   risk may impact the overall carbon sequestration capacity, and that the
   proposed approach may represent a valuable tool to support policy makers
   in their strategic decisions.},

Abstract = {The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) published in 2007 presents the
   most complete and authoritative assessment of the status of scientific
   knowledge on all aspects of climate change. This paper presents an
   updated assessment of the risks from anthropogenic climate change, based
   on a comprehensive review of the pertinent scientific literature
   published since finalisation of the AR4. Many risks are now assessed as
   stronger than in the AR4, including the risk of large sea-level rise
   already in the current century, the amplification of global warming due
   to biological and geological carbon-cycle feedbacks, a large magnitude
   of ``committed warming{''} currently concealed by a strong aerosol mask,
   substantial increases in climate variability and extreme weather events,
   and the risks to marine ecosystems from climate change and ocean
   acidification. Some topics remain the subject of intense scientific
   debate, such as past and future changes in tropical cyclone activity and
   the risk of large-scale Amazon forest dieback. The rise in greenhouse
   gas emissions and concentrations has accelerated recently, and it is
   expected to accelerate further in the absence of targeted policy
   interventions. Taken together, these findings point to an increased
   urgency of implementing mitigation policies as well as comprehensive and
   equitable adaptation policies.},

Title = {On the mitigating environmental aspects of a vertical well in

Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Underground coal gasification (UCG) is an energy production pathway in
   underground coal deposits with the potential advantage of decreasing the
   greenhouse gas emissions during the energy extraction process. The
   environmental benefits of UCG are mainly due to eliminating (i)
   conventional mining operations, (ii) the presence of coal miners in the
   underground, (iii) coal washing and fines disposal, and (iv) coal
   stockpiling and coal transportation activities. Furthermore, UCG has a
   capacity of great potential to provide a clean coal energy source by the
   implementing carbon capture and storage techniques as part of the energy
   extraction process. In this method, coal seams in the underground were
   converted into syngas including hydrogen (H-2), carbon monoxide (CO),
   carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) gasses with an advanced
   thermochemical process. UCG operation effected significant geomechanical
   changes to the overburden strata. In this process, the vertical well
   (especially the production well) was mainly affected by the mechanical
   stresses and the thermal stress, induced by the high syngas temperature.
   This high temperature changed the mechanical, thermal, and physical
   properties of the coal seam and its surrounding rocks (the host rocks),
   finally causing instability of the vertical well, while leading to
   serious production and environmental problems. One of these
   environmental issues is the possibility of syngas leakage in to the
   environment, resulting in water pollution and acidification. In
   addition, the released syngas could trigger global warming and air
   pollution. This research evaluated environmental aspects of UCG vertical
   well (production well) based on the stability analysis. Therefore, a
   flow sheet form was developed for three-dimensional thermomechanical
   numerical modeling of an UCG vertical well by explicit Lagrangian finite
   difference method. In this model, a criterion was established based on
   normalized yielded zone area to assess the stability conditions. The
   methodology was able to capture all factors that influence the
   instability of UCG well while selecting suitable mud pressure and lining
   system during the well drilling process. Hence, when wellbore integrity
   issues arose during drilling, the mitigation strategies were applied to
   rectify these problems. The results demonstrated that the vertical well
   should be drilled at a constant mud pressure of 9MPa (megapascal), thus
   causing minimum environmental problems. The thermomechanical modeling
   provided an opportunity to assess the potential environmental impacts
   and identify reliable global climate change mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Hydrochar more effectively mitigated nitrous oxide emissions than
   pyrochar from a coastal soil of the Yellow River Delta, China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {858},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Application of char amendments (e.g., pyrochar or biochar, hydrochar) in
   degraded soils is proposed as a promising solution for mitigating
   climate change via carbon sequestration and greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   emission reduction. However, the hydrochar-mediated microbial modulation
   mechanisms underlying N2O emissions from coastal salt -affected soils,
   one of essential blue C ecosystems, were poorly understood. Therefore, a
   wheat straw derived hydrochar (SHC) produced at 220 degrees C was
   prepared to investigate its effects on N2O emissions from a coastal
   salt-affected soil in the Yellow River Delta and to distinguish the
   microbial regulation mechanisms in comparison with corresponding
   pyrochar pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C (SPC) using a 28-day soil microcosm
   experiment. Compared with SPC, the acidic SHC (pH 4.15) enriched in
   oxygenated functional groups, labile C and N constituents. SHC
   application more efficiently de-pressed cumulative soil N2O emissions
   (48.4-61.1 \% vs 5.57-45.2 \%) than those of SPC. SHC-induced inhibition
   of ammonia-oxidizing gene (amoA)-mediated nitrification and promotion of
   full reduction of N2O to N2 by nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ) were
   the underlying microbial mechanisms. Structural equation models further
   revealed that SHC-modulated bacterial N-transformation responses, i.e.,
   inhibited nitrification and promoted heterotrophic de -nitrification,
   mainly contributed to reduced N2O emissions, whereas modification of
   soil properties (e.g., decreased pH, increased total C content) by SPC
   dominantly accounted for decreased N2O emissions. These results address
   new insights into microbial regulation of N2O emission reduction from
   the coastal salt-affected soils amended with hydrochar, and provide the
   promising strategies to enhance C sequestration and mitigate GHG
   emissions in the blue C ecosystems.},

Title = {Upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions},
Journal = {GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Non-technical summary. Manhattan, Berlin and New Delhi all need to take
   action to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions. While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights,
   comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely
   to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth
   observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated
   to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present
   three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas:
   main-streaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and
   taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative
   data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the
   potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the
   global scale.
   Technical summary. Cities have an increasingly integral role in
   addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions,
   we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including
   data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of
   socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data
   science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution
   of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban
   economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes
   for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1)
   Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2)
   Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while
   maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data
   science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the
   systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and
   solutions. Collaborative efforts towards a joint data platform and
   integrated urban services would provide the quantitative foundations of
   the emerging global urban sustainability science.},

Title = {Sea-level rise and impacts projections under a future scenario with
   large greenhouse gas emission reductions},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Using projections from two coupled climate models (HadCM3C and
   HadGEM2-AO), we consider the effect on 21st century sea-level rise (SLR)
   of mitigation policies relative to a scenario of business-as-usual
   (BAU). Around a third of the global-mean SLR over the century is avoided
   by a mitigation scenario under which global-mean near surface air
   temperature stabilises close to the Copenhagen Accord limit of a 2 C
   increase. Under BAU (a variant of the A1B scenario) the model-averaged
   projected SLR for 2090-2099 relative to 1980-1999 is 0.29 m-0.51 m
   (5\%-95\% uncertainties from treatment of land-based ice melt); under
   mitigation (E1 scenario) it is 0.17 m-0.34 m. This reduction is
   primarily from reduced thermal expansion. The spatial patterns of
   regional SLR are fairly dissimilar between the models, but are
   qualitatively similar across scenarios for a particular model. An
   impacts model suggests that by the end of the 21st century and without
   upgrade in defences around 55\% of the 84 million additional people
   flooded per year globally under BAU (from SLR alone) could be avoided
   under such mitigation. The above projections of SLR follow the
   methodology of the IPCC Fourth Assessment. We have, however, also
   conducted a sensitivity study of SLR and its impacts where the
   possibility of accelerated ice sheet dynamics is accounted for.

Title = {The potential of fertilizer management for reducing nitrous oxide
   emissions in the cleaner production of bamboo in China},

Abstract = {Quantifying the rapidly increasing nitrous oxide emission from excessive
   nitrogen fertilizer input is a pressing demand for reducing greenhouse
   gas in cleaner agricultural production. The purpose of this work is to
   assess the nitrous oxide emission from the intensively fertilized bamboo
   plantations to better understand the mitigation potential of fertilizer
   management, and to develop an approach for advancing the site-specific
   emission factors considering influences of climate and soil conditions.
   Based on the commonly adopted fertilization practices, the
   biogeochemical model DeNitrification-DeComposition was adjusted and
   validated to estimate and analyze nitrous oxide emission under four
   typical fertilizer management scenarios, namely fertilizer input
   reduction, split fertilization, deeper placement, and slow-release
   fertilizers. The simulation results show that the tested fertilizer
   management practices present great potential for reducing nitrous oxide
   emissions whereas mitigation effect of each adaptation depends on the
   site-specific conditions. In the cases of China, fertilizer reduction
   and adaptation with slow-release fertilizers application are shown to be
   the most cost-beneficial fertilization options for nitrous oxide
   mitigation in humid and arid regions, respectively. The highest
   mitigation achievable ranged from 60.3\% (humid coast) to 92.9\% (arid
   inland) compared to the current practice with excessive fertilization.
   If these adapted fertilization practices are implemented at the national
   scale, approximately 8.02 -11.38 million tonnes carbon dioxide
   equivalents per year of nitrous oxide emission could be reduced in 2030,
   which is 4.0\%-5.7\% of the total nitrous oxide emission from China's
   upland cropping system. The results indicate the critical importance of
   site-specific fertilizer management on reducing nitrous oxide emission
   in bamboo production. By considering the site-specific conditions, the
   overall biogeochemical modelling approach could serve as a more
   effective tool than the commonly used emission factors to quantify
   emission and screen fertilizer management options in cleaner
   agricultural production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In order to prevent the drastic climate changes predicted by the first
   and second IPCC assessment reports {[}16,17], The Kyoto protocol
   establishes that the developed countries should reduce between 2008 and
   2012 GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions in 5.2\% in comparison to the amount
   emitted in 1990 {[}5]. On the other hand, due to the world accelerated
   economy development on the last decade and its increasing demand for
   power, working only with energy efficiency improvements, renewable
   energy sources, switch to less carbon intensive fuels and nuclear power
   would require at least 50 years to significantly reduce the energetic
   matrix dependence on fossil fuels. According to CDIAC {[}13], the net
   CO2 emissions raised from 21 GtCO2 (1990) to 27 GtCO2 (2004). Therefore
   other mitigating actions must be taken. One of the options is to capture
   and store CO2 generated in electric power plants, witch represent the
   majority of the CO2 emission sources. Potential technical storage
   methods are geological storage, ocean storage and industrial fixation of
   CO2 into organic carbonates.},

Abstract = {THE ultimate goal of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to
   achieve `'stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations...at a level
   that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference,vith the climate
   system''. With the concentration targets yet to be determined, Working
   Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change developed a set
   of illustrative pathways for stabilizing the atmospheric CO2
   concentration at 350, 450, 550, 650 and 750 p.p.m.v. over the next few
   hundred years(1,2). But no attempt was made to determine whether the
   implied emissions might constitute a realistic transition away from the
   current heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Here me devise new
   stabilization profiles that explicitly (albeit qualitatively)
   incorporate considerations of the global economic system, estimate the
   corresponding anthropogenic emissions requirements, and assess the
   significance of the profiles in terms of global-mean temperature and sea
   level changes. Our findings raise a number of important issues for those
   engaged in climate-change policy making, particularly with regard to the
   optimal timing of mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {There is strong scientific evidence that the average temperature of the
   earth's surface is rising as a result of the increased concentration of
   carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere owing to
   human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, and
   gas. This global warming will lead to substantial changes of climate,
   many of which will impact human communities in deleterious ways. In
   terms of the likely global pattern of climate change over the
   twenty-first century, in the absence of any mitigating action the global
   average temperature is likely to rise by between about 1-5 and
   5-5degreesC and sea level by about half a metre (range 0(.)1-0(.)9 m).
   The hydrological cycle is likely to be more intense (leading in some
   places to more frequent and more intense floods and droughts) and the
   rate of climate change is likely to be substantially greater than the
   earth has experienced over at least the last ten thousand years. It is
   particularly to this rapid rate of change that it will be difficult for
   many ecosystems and for humans to adapt. Action has been taken by the
   world's scientists through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   to assess as thoroughly as possible knowledge regarding the basic
   science and the impacts, including an assessment of the uncertainties.
   The world's governments have also taken action in setting up the
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) at the Earth Summit in
   1992 and at subsequent meetings of the parties to that convention,
   especially that at Kyoto in 1997. In order to mitigate climate change
   the FCCC in its article 2 has set the objective of stabilisation of the
   concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level and on a
   timescale consistent with the needs both of the environment and of
   sustainable development. Such stabilisation will eventually demand
   severe cuts in global emissions, for instance of carbon dioxide, to
   levels well below today's by the second half of the twenty-first
   century. To achieve the required reductions in the emissions of carbon
   dioxide, three possibilities are available, to sequester carbon dioxide
   resulting from the burning of fossil fuels rather than releasing it to
   the atmosphere, to become much more efficient in the generation and use
   of energy, and to provide for energy supply from non-fossiI fuel
   sources. This article will summarise the science of climate change
   including the evidence for it and will describe the main impacts, the
   actions taken so far, and the further actions that are likely to be
   necessary to mitigate climate change.},

Abstract = {The transportation sector has become the fastest growing source of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One solution to mitigate the impacts is
   a shift towards electric modes. Where previous studies have only focused
   on the replacement of individual modes, our study presents a more
   holistic approach by comparing land-based, water-based and airborne
   transportation modes. We study the GHG emission reduction potentials of
   electric cars, buses, trains, ferries and aircraft in comparison to
   existing modes on 34 routes within Finland and across the Baltic Sea to
   Sweden and Estonia. By comparing the GHG emissions in carbon dioxide
   equivalents (CO2-eq) per passenger kilometer for each mode, we also
   consider the emissions generated from battery production as well as the
   differences in the energy mix from electricity production of the three
   studied countries. In addition to CO2-eq emissions per passenger
   kilometer, we also take real door-to-door travel times into account. Our
   study found that electric transportation modes possess great potential
   for emissions reduction. Nevertheless, depending on the energy mix used
   for electricity production, the emissions of electric transportation
   modes can exceed those of existing modes significantly. In addition, the
   emissions generated by battery production can have a significant share
   of the total emissions and should therefore always be considered.
   Finally, while also taking into account the door-to-door travel times,
   our study identified the great potential of electric aircraft to provide
   a less carbon intensive transportation option paired with short travel
   times starting on routes beyond 300 km where no high-speed rail exists
   as well as on routes across the water.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing based maps of tidal marshes, both of their extents and
   carbon stocks, have the potential to play a key role in conducting
   greenhouse gas inventories and implementing climate mitigation policies.
   Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal
   marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse
   tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). We
   developed the first calibration-grade, national-scale dataset of
   aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground
   plant carbon content (\%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA,
   Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco
   Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. Using the random forest machine learning
   algorithm, we tested whether imagery from multiple sensors, Sentinel-1
   C-band synthetic aperture radar, Landsat, and the National Agriculture
   Imagery Program (NAIP), can improve model performance. The final model,
   driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted
   vegetation index as the most important (n = 409, RMSE = 310 g/m2, 10.3\%
   normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh
   plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form.
   Model results were improved by scaling field-measured biomass
   calibration data by NAIP-derived 30 m fraction green vegetation. With a
   mean plant carbon content of 44.1\% (n = 1384, 95\% C.I. =
   43.99\%-44.37\%), we generated regional 30 m aboveground carbon density
   maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by
   a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map. We applied a
   multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon
   densities and stocks that considered standard error in map area, mean
   biomass and mean \%C. Louisiana palustrine emergent marshes had the
   highest C density (2.67 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha) of all regions, while San
   Francisco Bay brackish/saline marshes had the highest C density of all
   estuarine emergent marshes (2.03 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha). Estimated C stocks
   for predefined jurisdictional areas ranged from 1023 +/- 39 Mg in the
   Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in Washington to 507,761 +/- 14,822
   Mg in the Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes in Louisiana. This modeling
   and data synthesis effort will allow for aboveground C stocks in tidal
   marshes to be included in the coastal wetland section of the U.S.
   National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. With the increased availability of
   free post-processed satellite data, we provide a tractable means of
   modeling tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon at the global extent
   as well. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Society

Abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases could lead to undesirable
   effects on oceans in coming centuries. Drawing on recommendations
   published by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, levels of
   unacceptable global marine change (so-called guardrails) are defined in
   terms of global mean temperature, sea level rise, and ocean
   acidification. A global-mean climate model {[}the Aggregated Carbon
   Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model (ACC2)] is coupled with
   an economic module {[}taken from the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy
   Model (DICE)] to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to derive CO2
   emission pathways that both minimize abatement costs and are compatible
   with these guardrails. Additionally, the ``tolerable windows
   approach{''} is used to calculate a range of CO2 emissions paths that
   obey the guardrails as well as a restriction on mitigation rate.
   Prospects of meeting the global mean temperature change guardrail (2
   degrees and 0.2 degrees C decade(-1) relative to preindustrial) depend
   strongly on assumed values for climate sensitivity: at climate
   sensitivities >3 degrees C the guardrail cannot be attained under any
   CO2 emissions reduction strategy without mitigation of non-CO2
   greenhouse gases. The ocean acidification guardrail (0.2 unit pH decline
   relative to preindustrial) is less restrictive than the absolute
   temperature guardrail at climate sensitivities >2.5 degrees C but
   becomes more constraining at lower climate sensitivities. The sea level
   rise and rate of rise guardrails (1 m and 5 cm decade(-1)) are
   substantially less stringent for ice sheet sensitivities derived in the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment
   Report, but they may already be committed to violation if ice sheet
   sensitivities consistent with semiempirical sea level rise projections
   are assumed.},

Abstract = {New scientific understanding could increase the cost-effectiveness of
   local and regional air quality management policies, enhance the
   acceptance of mitigation measures for long-lived greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, and reveal win-win portfolios of controls for short-lived
   substances that yield immediate health and crop benefits while limiting
   temperature increase in the near term. However, although substantial
   efforts have been devoted to global analyses of the emissions of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and other long-lived GHGs, air pollutant emissions have
   received only limited attention in the global context. Past and likely
   future trends in air pollutant emissions evolve rather differently from
   those of long-lived GHGs, so that superficial extrapolations of GHG
   trends would lead to misleading conclusions. In many world regions, the
   evolution of air pollutant emissions has effectively decoupled from
   economic growth. Since 1990, air pollutant emissions declined (sulfur
   dioxide, SO2), stabilized (nitrogen oxides, NOx), or increased slightly
   (black carbon, BC; organic carbon, OC; and ammonia, NH3). This review
   discusses to what extent structural changes, technological improvements,
   and dedicated environmental legislation have contributed to these
   changes. The scenarios of future emissions in the literature span a wide
   range, mainly owing to different assumptions about future environmental
   policies. Although the more recent scenarios agree on declining air
   pollutants up to 2030, avoiding potential rebounds of emissions after
   2030 will require additional policy interventions.},

Title = {A systems approach to assess climate change mitigation options in
   landscapes of the United States forest sector},
Journal = {CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {Background: United States forests can contribute to national strategies
   for greenhouse gas reductions. The objective of this work was to
   evaluate forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios from 2018 to
   2050 by applying a systems-based approach that accounts for net
   emissions across four interdependent components: (1) forest ecosystem,
   (2) land-use change, (3) harvested wood products, and (4) substitution
   benefits from using wood products and bioenergy. We assessed a range of
   land management and harvested wood product scenarios for two case
   studies in the U.S: coastal South Carolina and Northern Wisconsin. We
   integrated forest inventory and remotely-sensed disturbance data within
   a modelling framework consisting of a growth-and-yield driven ecosystem
   carbon model; a harvested wood products model that estimates emissions
   from commodity production, use and post-consumer treatment; and
   displacement factors to estimate avoided fossil fuel emissions. We
   estimated biophysical mitigation potential by comparing net emissions
   from land management and harvested wood products scenarios with a
   baseline ('business as usual') scenario.
   Results: Baseline scenario results showed that the strength of the
   ecosystem carbon sink has been decreasing in the two sites due to
   age-related productivity declines and deforestation. Mitigation
   activities have the potential to lessen or delay the further reduction
   in the carbon sink. Results of the mitigation analysis indicated that
   scenarios reducing net forest area loss were most effective in South
   Carolina, while extending harvest rotations and increasing longer-lived
   wood products were most effective in Wisconsin. Scenarios aimed at
   increasing bioenergy use either increased or reduced net emissions
   within the 32-year analysis timeframe.
   Conclusions: It is critical to apply a systems approach to
   comprehensively assess net emissions from forest sector climate change
   mitigation scenarios. Although some scenarios produced a benefit by
   displacing emissions from fossil fuel energy or by substituting wood
   products for other materials, these benefits can be outweighed by
   increased carbon emissions in the forest or product systems. Maintaining
   forests as forests, extending rotations, and shifting commodities to
   longer-lived products had the strongest mitigation benefits over several
   decades. Carbon cycle impacts of bioenergy depend on timeframe,
   feedstocks, and alternative uses of biomass, and cannot be assumed
   carbon neutral.},

   Thailand},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mangrove forest is a blue-carbon-rich ecosystem and source of greenhouse
   gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. Recent studies of GHG fluxes have been
   limited for inventory baseline in Thailand. Three GHG emissions were
   investigated for different mangrove establishment and managements in
   Ranong province; natural rehabilitation, reforestation, and primary
   undisturbed forests, due to their differences in carbon and nutrient
   input as a result of natural and human-induced management. The static
   closed-chamber technique was used to collected gas sample from soil and
   water surface interface throughout the year. Total highest GHG emissions
   were found in the primary undisturbed site (15.40 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1)
   yr(-1)), compared to the reforestation and natural rehabilitation sites
   (12.60 and 8.53 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), respectively. The mean
   average of GHG fluxes at soil-air interface for three mangrove sites
   were 2.59 +/- 0.94 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 3.86 +/- 2.01 mu mol CH4 m(-2)
   h(-1), and 2.09 +/- 1.59 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1). Whereas at water-air
   interface, GHG fluxes were 1.66 +/- 0.66 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 2.47 +/-
   1.47 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and 2.74 +/- 1.06 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1).
   The undisturbed and reforested sites with good conservation, enriched
   organic matters and nitrogen nutrients, and large mature trees had
   significantly higher CO2 emission. CH4 fluxes had significantly higher
   in the natural rehabilitation site with well growing stage and dominant
   in low-elevated area with longer inundation periods. Whereas N2O
   emissions were not statistically different among three mangrove sites.
   GHG fluxes were recorded higher in soil surface during wet season and
   rainfall was significantly correlated to CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.
   Additionally, the results would be useful in improving mangrove
   conservation and restoration strategy for GHG emission mitigation and
   developing an inventory baseline and more accurately estimating of GHG
   emissions from different mangroves in Thailand. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Any discussion of the benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation
   measures should take into consideration the full range of possible
   climate change outcomes, including impacts that remain highly uncertain,
   like surprises and other climate irreversibilities. Real-world coupling
   between complex systems can cause them to exhibit new collective
   behaviours that are not clearly demonstrable by models that do not
   include such coupling. Through examples from ocean circulation and
   atmosphere-biosphere interactions, this paper demonstrates that external
   forcings such as increases in GHG concentrations can push complex
   systems from one equilibrium state to another, with non-linear abrupt
   change as a possible consequence. Furthermore, the harder and faster a
   system is perturbed, the higher the likelihood of such surprises-a
   conclusion that has significant bearing on the assessment of the
   potential benefits of the timing and stringency of GHG abatement
   measures. The paper concludes with a perspective on how to better
   incorporate uncertainty and surprise into integrated assessment models
   of climate change. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Emerging trends in science and news of climate change threats to and
   adaptation of aquaculture},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {549},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Food production is one of the main contributors to climate change, but
   is also vulnerable to the resulting stressors, which is well documented
   for agriculture and fisheries. Attention is now turning to the rapidly
   growing aquaculture sector and its vulnerability to a changing climate.
   Here we explore the extent to which climate stressors and aquaculture,
   and concomitant adaptation strategies, are studied in science and
   addressed in public media (news) to assess focus and attribution of
   climate change. We reviewed 553 scientific publications and 228 news
   media articles on climate stressors, impacts, and adaptation approaches
   with respect to aquaculture. Results indicate that coverage in the
   scientific community of climate stressors on aquaculture have not kept
   pace with growth of production in the sector, especially compared to
   agriculture and fisheries. Temperature, sea level rise, and ocean
   acidification were most often the focus in science (44\%) and news
   (42\%), suggesting some alignment. Combined coverage tended to revolve
   around Asia, Europe, and North/Central America (70\%) and at least 10
   countries' science and news linked current impacts on aquaculture to
   climate change. The majority of scientific articles addressing
   adaptation were regional rather than global, and emphasized governance
   and institutional strategies over technological solutions. In all, this
   research highlights the comparatively nascent focus of climate change
   implications for aquaculture, narrow emphasis of stressors, but fairly
   representative coverage of regions with more aquaculture. Our work
   highlights the need for more research and public awareness of the social
   and ecological climate change threats and impacts on, and adaptive
   strategies for aquaculture.},

Title = {How Climate Change May Threaten Progress in Neonatal Health in the
   African Region},
Journal = {NEONATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Climate change is likely to have wide-ranging impacts on maternal and
   neonatal health in Africa. Populations in low-resource settings already
   experience adverse impacts from weather extremes, a high burden of
   disease from environmental exposures, and limited access to high-quality
   clinical care. Climate change is already increasing local temperatures.
   Neonates are at high risk of heat stress and dehydration due to their
   unique metabolism, physiology, growth, and developmental
   characteristics. Infants in low-income settings may have little
   protection against extreme heat due to housing design and limited access
   to affordable space cooling. Climate change may increase risks to
   neonatal health from weather disasters, decreasing food security, and
   facilitating infectious disease transmission. Effective interventions to
   reduce risks from the heat include health education on heat risks for
   mothers, caregivers, and clinicians; nature-based solutions to reduce
   urban heat islands; space cooling in health facilities; and equitable
   improvements in housing quality and food systems. Reductions in
   greenhouse gas emissions are essential to reduce the long-term impacts
   of climate change that will further undermine global health strategies
   to reduce neonatal mortality.},

Title = {Large point source (LPS) emissions from India: regional and sectoral
   analysis},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Indian large point sources (LPS) contribute to CO2 and SO2 emissions to
   a large extent (above 65\%) and to CH4, N2O and NOX emissions to some
   extent (around 10\%). The former emissions are primarily from fossil
   fuel combustion while the latter have agriculture sector dominance,
   explaining the drastic difference in LPS contributions to all India
   emissions. The present paper covers 509 LPS for India. These are well
   distributed across the country. However, there are some regions of very
   few LPS (like the western desert and the hilly areas of north, northeast
   and coastal west) and some regions of high LPS concentration
   (Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, Delhi and near coal mine mouths). There is a
   dominance of power plants in Indian LPS emissions for CO2 and SO2 (47\%
   each), with cement (9\% and 5\%) and steel (6\% and 7\%) plants being
   the other major contributors. Moreover, due to growing population,
   increasing urbanization and hi-her consumption levels, these LPS
   emissions are growing much faster than the national average. The present
   analysis would be useful for policy-making to mitigate these pollutants
   and their associated impacts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {Relevance of carbon stocks of marine sediments for national greenhouse
   gas inventories of maritime nations},
Journal = {CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Background: Determining national carbon stocks is essential in the
   framework of ongoing climate change mitigation actions. Presently,
   assessment of carbon stocks in the context of greenhouse gas
   (GHG)-reporting on a nation-by-nation basis focuses on the terrestrial
   realm, i.e., carbon held in living plant biomass and soils, and on
   potential changes in these stocks in response to anthropogenic
   activities. However, while the ocean and underlying sediments store
   substantial quantities of carbon, this pool is presently not considered
   in the context of national inventories. The ongoing disturbances to both
   terrestrial and marine ecosystems as a consequence of food production,
   pollution, climate change and other factors, as well as alteration of
   linkages and C-exchange between continental and oceanic realms,
   highlight the need for a better understanding of the quantity and
   vulnerability of carbon stocks in both systems. We present a preliminary
   comparison of the stocks of organic carbon held in continental margin
   sediments within the Exclusive Economic Zone of maritime nations with
   those in their soils. Our study focuses on Namibia, where there is a
   wealth of marine sediment data, and draws comparisons with sediment data
   from two other countries with different characteristics, which are
   Pakistan and the United Kingdom.
   Results: Results indicate that marine sediment carbon stocks in maritime
   nations can be similar in magnitude to those of soils. Therefore, if
   human activities in these areas are managed, carbon stocks in the
   oceanic realm-particularly over continental margins-could be considered
   as part of national GHG inventories.
   Conclusions: This study shows that marine sediment organic carbon stocks
   can be equal in size or exceed terrestrial carbon stocks of maritime
   nations. This provides motivation both for improved assessment of
   sedimentary carbon inventories and for reevaluation of the way that
   carbon stocks are assessed and valued. The latter carries potential
   implications for the management of human activities on coastal
   environments and for their GHG inventories.},

Title = {Where do islands put their waste? - A material flow and carbon footprint
   analysis of municipal waste management in the Maltese Islands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {1609-1619},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Waste management on small islands does not hold any straightforward
   solutions. The numerous difficulties include limited space availability,
   restricted recycling and resale opportunities and impacts on the local
   environment that become magnified particularly when the island is
   small-sized, densely populated and tourist dependent.
   The well-documented impact on the local environment includes resource
   loss, damage to the marine and local environment and continuous
   nuisances created by littering, trucks and treatment facilities.
   However, waste management can leave its mark beyond the local borders.
   The generation and treatment of waste is in fact gaining attention in
   its connection with greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Although in the past
   GHG emissions were mainly associated with energy generation, today it is
   frequently acknowledged that improved waste management can also mitigate
   these emissions.
   This research paper analysis the flows involved in the management of
   municipal waste (MW) from an island perspective. Focusing on the island
   of Malta, which consists of 316 km(2) and sustains a population density
   of 1327 people/km(2), a Material Flow Analysis together with a carbon
   footprint is presented for 2012. The same analysis is then made for
   three prospective scenarios proposed in the Waste Management Plan for
   the Maltese Islands 2014-2020 using projected 2018 data.
   With the use of STAN 2.5 (SubSTance Flow ANalysis), a tabled down
   analysis of the collection, treatment and disposal/export flows involved
   in the management of Municipal Waste in Malta is presented. The flows
   are then translated into a carbon footprint analysis using CO2ZW (R)((a
   carbon footprint tool for waste management).)The objective is to
   emphasize the relationship between GHG remove GHG and replace with
   Greenhouse Gas emissions and existing waste management flows and how
   this relationship changes when different collection, treatment and
   disposal options are selected. The research's ultimate aim is therefore
   to underline the importance of placing climate concerns in waste
   management policies.
   The results note that, in terms of carbon emissions, Malta stands to
   benefit from the introduction of a second Mechanical Biological
   Treatment plant since carbon emissions will experience an extensive
   reduction from the 2012 estimates. However, further reduction of carbon
   emissions should be accompanied by the increase of dry material
   recycling, separate organic collection and an analysis of the current
   collection system particularly route optimisation. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {In 2014, the Australian Government implemented the Emissions Reduction
   Fund to offer incentives for businesses to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions by following approved methods. Beef cattle businesses in
   northern Australia can participate by applying the reducing GHG
   emissions by feeding nitrates to beef cattle' methodology and the beef
   cattle herd management' methods. The nitrate (NO3) method requires that
   each baseline area must demonstrate a history of urea use. Projects earn
   Australian carbon credit units (ACCU) for reducing enteric methane
   emissions by substituting NO3 for urea at the same amount of fed
   nitrogen. NO3 must be fed in the form of a lick block because most
   operations do not have labour or equipment to manage daily
   supplementation. NO3 concentrations, after a 2-week adaptation period,
   must not exceed 50 g NO3/adult animal equivalent per day or 7 g NO3/kg
   dry matter intake per day to reduce the risk of NO3 toxicity. There is
   also a beef cattle herd management' method, approved in 2015, that
   covers activities that improve the herd emission intensity (emissions
   per unit of product sold) through change in the diet or management. The
   present study was conducted to compare the required ACCU or supplement
   prices for a 2\% return on capital when feeding a low or high supplement
   concentration to breeding stock of either (1) urea, (2) three different
   forms of NO3 or (3) cottonseed meal (CSM), at N concentrations
   equivalent to 25 or 50 g urea/animal equivalent, to fasten steer entry
   to a feedlot (backgrounding), in a typical breeder herd on the coastal
   speargrass land types in central Queensland. Monte Carlo simulations
   were run using the software @risk, with probability functions used for
   (1) urea, NO3 and CSM prices, (2) GHG mitigation, (3) livestock prices
   and (4) carbon price. Increasing the weight of steers at a set turnoff
   month by feeding CSM was found to be the most cost-effective option,
   with or without including the offset income. The required ACCU prices
   for a 2\% return on capital were an order of magnitude higher than were
   indicative carbon prices in 2015 for the three forms of NO3. The likely
   costs of participating in ERF projects would reduce the return on
   capital for all mitigation options.},

   land use activities},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {175-194},
Abstract = {Identifying and quantifying the sources of climate impacts from land use
   and land cover change (LULCC) is necessary to optimize policies
   regarding LULCC for climate change mitigation. These climate impacts are
   typically defined relative to emissions of CO2, or sometimes emissions
   of other long-lived greenhouse gases. Here we use previously published
   estimates of the radiative forcing (RF) of LULCC that include the
   short-lived forcing agents O-3 and aerosols, in addition to long-lived
   greenhouse gases and land albedo change, for six projections of LULCC as
   a metric for quantifying climate impacts. The LULCC RF is attributed to
   three categories of LULCC activities: direct modifications to land
   cover, agriculture, and wildfire response, and sources of the forcing
   are ascribed to individual grid points for each sector. Results for the
   year 2010 show substantial positive forcings from the direct
   modifications and agriculture sectors, particularly from south and
   southeast Asia, and a smaller magnitude negative forcing response from
   wildfires. The spatial distribution of future sources of LULCC RF is
   highly scenario-dependent, but we show that future forest area change
   can be used as a predictor of the future RF from direct modification
   activities, especially in the tropics, suggesting that
   deforestation-prevention policies that value land based on its C-content
   may be particularly effective at mitigating climate forcing originating
   in the tropics from this sector. However, the response of wildfire RF to
   tropical land cover changes is not as easily scalable and yet imposes a
   non-trivial feedback onto the total LULCC RF.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In order to assess the merits of national climate change mitigation
   policies, it is important to have a reasonable benchmark for how much
   human-caused global warming would occur over the coming century with
   ``Business-As-Usual{''} (BAU) conditions. However, currently,
   policymakers are limited to making assessments by comparing the Global
   Climate Model (GCM) projections of future climate change under various
   different ``scenarios{''}, none of which are explicitly defined as BAU.
   Moreover, all of these estimates are ab initio computer model
   projections, and policymakers do not currently have equivalent
   empirically derived estimates for comparison. Therefore, estimates of
   the total future human-caused global warming from the three main
   greenhouse gases of concern (CO2, CH4, and N2O) up to 2100 are here
   derived for BAU conditions. A semi-empirical approach is used that
   allows direct comparisons between GCM-based estimates and empirically
   derived estimates. If the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases
   implies a Transient Climate Response (TCR) of >= 2.5 degrees C or an
   Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of >= 5.0 degrees C then the 2015
   Paris Agreement's target of keeping human-caused global warming below
   2.0 degrees C will have been broken by the middle of the century under
   BAU. However, for a TCR < 1.5 <degrees>C or ECS < 2.0 <degrees>C, the
   target would not be broken under BAU until the 22nd century or later.
   Therefore, the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   ``likely{''} range estimates for TCR of 1.0 to 2.5 degrees C and ECS of
   1.5 to 4.5 degrees C have not yet established if human-caused global
   warming is a 21st century problem.},

Abstract = {Accurate evaluation and prediction of the potential impact of climate
   change on crop production is essential to the sustainable development of
   a country's agriculture. Model variations plus uncertainties in the
   future climate change scenarios create a big challenge for such
   evaluation. In this work, we developed a statistical crop model using
   the historical yield data between 19812010 from the National Bureau of
   Statistics; and analyzed the impact of temperature and precipitation
   change on the crop yields in six different regions of China based on
   ensemble climate predictions from CMIP5 (the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5). Our results suggest that crop
   productionss per unit sown area in Eastern, Centural-South, and
   Southwest China were all negetively impacted by increasing temperature,
   while in Northwest China the yield was positively correlated with both
   temperature and precipitation change. The sensitivity of crop yield to
   climate warming tends to increase from north to south and from inner
   land to coast regions. Future projections with a medium greenhouse gas
   mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) showed that without sufficient adaptation
   measures the crop yield in China would experience a 3.4-8.0\% reduction
   in 2030s. Our approach used over 20 ensemble predictions from six
   state-of-the-art climate models thus reduced the overall uncertainty and
   provided a consistant albeit conservative assessment of the climate
   impact.},

   Haiti, Jamaica, St Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the

   from the Energy sector, with the energy industries and transportation
   sub-sectors being the most important. In the case of Haiti, massive
   deforestation has led to important CO2 emissions.
   Not accounting for natural sinks, most Caribbean countries still turn
   out to be net removers of CO2. Emissions of non-CO2 gases, except for
   Trinidad and Tobago are minimal.
   The relatively low levels of GHG emissions, the under developed
   economies and the lack of in-house environmentally sound clean
   technologies therefore make it very difficult for the Small Island
   States of the Caribbean to seriously consider GHG mitigation measures,
   especially in view of the prohibitive costs of such abatement measures.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The goal of reducing the climate impact of shipping requires many
   different activities. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the
   International Maritime Organization prepared some proposals to meet and
   fulfill the requirements. It sets out the provisions of the
   International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
   73/78 Annex 6-Prevention of the Air Pollution from Ships (1997) with the
   amendments and the future objectives set. The main objective is to
   achieve climate neutrality from shipping by 2050. One method is the
   decarbonization of marine fuels. The types of fuels that are transient
   fuels, with the final target fuel being hydrogen, are shown. Carbon
   dioxide emissions depend on the chemical composition of the fuel, its
   Lower Heating Value and the engine efficiency. The aim of the manuscript
   is to demonstrate that the use of fuels with lower carbon content is a
   transitional process enabling the hydrogen era to take place. An
   analysis of this problem is presented as a review of the subject along
   with the author's comments and observations. The development of
   technologies for adapting potential fuels to combustion requirements in
   marine diesel engines and gas turbines, together with their storage and
   bunkering capabilities, are the main barriers to their limited use. The
   efficiency of marine diesel engines reaches a value of about 50\%, while
   that of fuel cells are close to 100\%. It seems that hydrogen will be
   the fuel of the future, including in shipping. Its basic use is in fuel
   cells, the efficiency of which is almost twice that of current thermal
   internal combustion engines.},

Abstract = {There are 209 UNESCO World Natural Heritage sites around the world that
   provide an outstanding amount of universal value. Among them, 37 are in
   Latin America, and seven in Brazil. There are two natural sites in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest of significant concern: (i) Atlantic Forest
   South-East Reserves and (ii) Discovery Coast Atlantic Forest Reserves.
   Climate change poses a very high threat to these forest reserves. The
   fragmented forests are believed to be particularly vulnerable to the
   expected impacts of climate change such as erosion and water
   availability. This paper presents an analysis about the potential
   biophysical climate change impacts in these two World Natural Heritage
   sites. An impact model was built using climate variables and climate
   extremes from two regional climate models available for Brazil:
   Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5. Simulations were made using two different
   greenhouse gases emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and two
   timeframe windows (1961-2005/2071-2100). Erosion, soil water
   availability and occurrence of phytophysiognomies were analyzed in this
   research. Critical areas in the reserves were identified and should now
   be set by government as priority in the national climate adaptation
   strategy.},

Abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the carbon budget on global and regional scales is
   critically important to design mitigation strategies aimed at
   stabilizing the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. For a better
   understanding of CO(2)variation trends over Asia, in this study, the
   column-averaged CO(2)dry air mole fraction (XCO2) derived from the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CarbonTracker
   (CT) was compared with that of Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite
   (GOSAT) from September 2009 to August 2019 and with Orbiting Carbon
   Observatory 2 (OCO-2) from September 2014 until August 2019. Moreover,
   monthly averaged time-series and seasonal climatology comparisons were
   also performed separately over the five regions of Asia; i.e., Central
   Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Western Asia. The
   results show that XCO(2)from GOSAT is higher than the XCO(2)simulated by
   CT by an amount of 0.61 ppm, whereas, OCO-2 XCO(2)is lower than CT by
   0.31 ppm on average, over Asia. The mean spatial correlations of 0.93
   and 0.89 and average Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSDs) of 2.61 and
   2.16 ppm were found between the CT and GOSAT, and CT and OCO-2,
   respectively, implying the existence of a good agreement between the CT
   and the other two satellites datasets. The spatial distribution of the
   datasets shows that the larger uncertainties exist over the southwest
   part of China. Over Asia, NOAA CT shows a good agreement with GOSAT and
   OCO-2 in terms of spatial distribution, monthly averaged time series,
   and seasonal climatology with small biases. These results suggest that
   CO(2)can be used from either of the datasets to understand its role in
   the carbon budget, climate change, and air quality at regional to global
   scales.},

   LINKAGES BETWEEN SCIENCE, POLICY AND PRACTICE},

Abstract = {Cities are high emitters of greenhouse gases and are drivers of
   environmental modification, often leading to degradation and
   fragmentation of ecosystems at local and regional scales. Linked to
   these trends is a growing threat experienced by urban areas: the risk
   from hydro-meteorological and climatological hazards, further
   accentuated by climate change. Ecosystems and their services, though
   often overlooked or degraded, can provide multiple hazard regulating
   functions such as coastal and surface flood regulation, temperature
   regulation and erosion control. Engineering or grey approaches often do
   not tackle the root causes of risk and can increase the vulnerability of
   populations over the long-term. However, evidence of alternative
   approaches such as the role of healthy, functioning ecosystems in
   disaster risk reduction are still scarce, contentious, and with limited
   applicability in the urban context. This chapter explores the role of
   grey, green, and blue infrastructure and in particular hybrid approaches
   for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to shed light
   on available sustainable adaptation opportunities in cities and urban
   areas. We highlight the dependence of cities on ecosystems as a key
   component of climate resilience building through case studies and
   literature review. At the same time, we highlight the limitation and
   drawbacks in the adoption of merely grey or merely green
   infrastructures. We suggest that an intermediate `hybrid' approach,
   which combines both blue, green and grey approaches, may be the most
   effective strategy for reducing risk to hazards in the urban context.},

Pages = {5-18},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Global sea levels are rising and this change is expected to accelerate
   in the coming century due to anthropogenic global warming. Any rise in
   sea level promotes land loss, increased flooding and salinisation. The
   impacts of and possible responses to sea-level rise vary at the local
   and regional scale due to variation in local and regional factors.
   Policy responses to the human-enhanced greenhouse effect need to address
   these different dimensions of climate change, including the regional
   scale. Based on global reviews and analyses of relative vulnerability, 4
   contrasting regions are selected and examined in more detail using local
   and national assessments. These regions are (1) Europe, (2) West Africa,
   (3) South, South-East and East Asia and (4) the Pacific Small Islands.
   Some potential impacts of sea-level rise are found to have strong
   regional dimensions and regional cooperation to foster mitigation
   approaches (to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, hence, the magnitude
   of climate change) and adaptive solutions to climate change impacts
   would be beneficial. For instance, in South, South-East and East Asia
   subsiding megacities and questions about long-term deltaic management
   are common and challenging issues. The debate on mitigation and
   stabilisation of greenhouse forcing also requires information on
   regional impacts of different emission pathways. These results will be

Abstract = {Schemes to modify large-scale environment systems or control climate
   have been proposed for over 50 years to (i) increase temperatures in
   high latitudes, (ii) increase precipitation, (iii) decrease sea ice,
   (iv) create irrigation opportunities, or (v) offset potential global
   warming by injecting iron in the oceans or sea-salt aerosol in the
   marine boundary layer or spreading dust in the stratosphere to reflect
   away an amount of solar energy equivalent to the amount of heat trapped
   by increased greenhouse gases from human activities. These and other
   proposed geoengineering schemes are briefly reviewed. Recent schemes to
   intentionally modify climate have been proposed as either cheaper
   methods to counteract inadvertent climatic modi. cations than
   conventional mitigation techniques such as carbon taxes or pollutant
   emissions regulations or as a counter to rising emissions as governments
   delay policy action. Whereas proponents argue cost-effectiveness or the
   need to be prepared if mitigation and adaptation policies are not strong
   enough or enacted quickly enough to avoid the worst widespread impacts,
   critics point to the uncertainty that (i) any geoengineering scheme
   would work as planned or (ii) that the many centuries of international
   political stability and cooperation needed for the continuous
   maintenance of such schemes to offset century-long inadvertent effects
   is socially feasible. Moreover, the potential exists for transboundary
   conflicts should negative climatic events occur during geoengineering
   activities.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzed quarterly longitudinal data for 64,800 1 x 1 degree
   grids during 2000-2019 on sea surface temperatures, sea ice
   concentrations, and ocean surface current zonal and meridional
   velocities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The methodological
   framework addressed the processing of remote sensing signals,
   interdependence between sea surface temperatures and sea ice
   concentrations, and combining zonal and meridional velocities as the
   eddy kinetic energy. Dynamic and static random effects models were
   estimated by maximum likelihood and stepwise methods, respectively,
   taking into account the unobserved heterogeneity across grids. The main
   findings were that quarterly sea surface temperatures increased steadily
   in the Northern hemisphere, whereas cyclical patterns were apparent in
   Southern hemisphere; sea ice concentrations declined in both
   hemispheres. Second, sea surface temperatures were estimated with large
   negative coefficients in the models for sea ice concentrations for the
   hemispheres; previous sea ice concentrations were negatively associated
   with sea surface temperatures, indicating feedback loops. Third, sea
   surface temperatures were positively and significantly associated with
   eddy kinetic energy in Northern hemisphere. Overall, the results
   indicated the importance of reducing sea surface temperatures via
   reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the dumping of pollutants
   into oceans for maintaining sea ice concentrations and enhancing global
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most important global environmental
   challenges, with implications for food production, water supply, health,
   energy, etc. Addressing climate change requires a good scientific
   understanding as well as coordinated action at national and global
   level. This paper addresses these challenges. Historically, the
   responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions' increase lies largely with
   the industrialized world, though the developing countries are likely to
   be the source of an increasing proportion of future emissions. The
   projected climate change under various scenarios is likely to have
   implications on food production, water supply, coastal settlements,
   forest ecosystems, health, energy security, etc. The adaptive capacity
   of communities likely to be impacted by climate change is low in
   developing countries. The efforts made by the UNFCCC and the Kyoto
   Protocol provisions are clearly inadequate to address the climate change
   challenge. The most effective way to address climate change is to adopt
   a sustainable development pathway by shifting to environmentally
   sustainable technologies and promotion of energy efficiency, renewable
   energy, forest conservation, reforestation, water conservation, etc. The
   issue of highest importance to developing countries is reducing the
   vulnerability of their natural and socio-economic systems to the
   projected climate change. India and other developing countries will face
   the challenge of promoting mitigation and adaptation strategies, bearing
   the cost of such an effort, and its implications for economic
   development.},

Title = {Larger Sensitivity of Arctic Precipitation Phase to Aerosol than
   Greenhouse Gas Forcing},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Number = {23},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {The sensitivity of the Arctic precipitation phases (solid and liquid) to
   the forcings from greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols over 2016-2080
   was investigated by using the Community Earth System Model Version 1.
   Results show that the warming caused by the two forcings results in an
   increasing trend in total precipitation and a solid-to-liquid
   precipitation transition in the Arctic. Under RCP8.5 scenario, the
   increased rate of Arctic mean precipitation with global warming forced
   by aerosol reduction (7.7\%/degrees C) is twice greater than that by
   increased GHG emission (3.5\%/degrees C). The sensitivity of rainfall to
   precipitation ratio (RPR) to various forcings is much higher than that
   of total precipitation in the Arctic. The increased rate of RPR due to
   global aerosol forcing (8.4\%/degrees C) is approximately 3 times that
   due to GHG forcing (2.9\%/degrees C) in the Arctic, the differences even
   larger over Greenland and the eastern Arctic Ocean, resulting in more
   rainfall in these areas.
   Plain Language Summary The precipitation phase is extremely sensitive to
   temperature changes, especially in the Arctic. Solid and liquid
   precipitation have almost the opposite effect on the ground energy
   budget. The changes in precipitation phase can greatly affect snow and
   ice mass balance, regulating the regional hydrological cycle. The
   transition from solid precipitation to liquid precipitation can even
   promote carbon release over the permafrost through changing the rate of
   snow melting. We evaluated the impacts of the two most important
   anthropogenic forcing agents (greenhouse gases {[}GHGs] and aerosols) on
   the changes of precipitation phases in the Arctic using a
   state-of-the-art Earth system model. We found that the warming forced by
   global aerosol reduction and increased GHG emission leads to a
   solid-to-liquid precipitation transition and therefore more rainfall
   events in the Arctic. Under RCP8.5 scenario, the sensitivity of Arctic
   precipitation phase to global aerosol forcing is approximately 3 times
   that to the GHG forcing, and the most sensitive phase changes of Arctic
   precipitation to the aerosol forcing are observed in Greenland and the
   eastern Arctic Ocean. Understanding the impact of human activities on
   the changes in the Arctic precipitation phase will help formulate
   reasonable emission reduction policies and better adapt to the rapid
   Arctic climate changes in the future.
   Key Points
   Warming forced by global aerosol reduction and increased GHG emission
   leads to a solid-to-liquid precipitation transition in the Arctic The
   sensitivity of Arctic precipitation phase to the aerosol forcing is
   approximately three times that to the GHG forcing The most sensitive
   phase changes of Arctic precipitation to the aerosol forcing are
   observed in Greenland and the eastern Arctic Ocean},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {319-336},
Abstract = {This paper examines the paradoxical issues surrounding long-distance
   tourism to view polar bears, a form of tourism which is
   disproportionately (on a per capita basis) responsible for greenhouse
   gases (GHG) emissions that are negatively affecting survival chances of
   the species. It also notes that the phenomenon of olast chance tourismo
   is influencing more tourists to visit the region. The paper describes
   and explains the evidence that climate change is causing a substantial
   reduction in sea ice, vital for Arctic wildlife species survival,
   particularly mega fauna, such as polar bears. Churchill, Canada is one
   of the few places where tourists can easily view polar bears. A total of
   334 on-site tourist surveys and 18 in-depth interviews were conducted to
   help evaluate tourist perceptions of climate change and to estimate
   their GHG emissions related to polar bear viewing tourism. Polar bear
   viewing tourists perceive climate change to be negatively impacting
   polar bears but do not necessarily understand how they themselves
   contribute to GHG emissions, or understand offsetting possibilities. The
   polar bear viewing industry is estimated to contribute 20,892 t/CO2 per
   season. Mitigation strategies, including reduction and offsetting
   programs are outlined.},

Abstract = {Tropical fisheries substantially contribute to the well-being of
   societies in both the tropics and the extratropics, the latter through
   `telecoupling' - linkages between distant human-natural systems.
   Tropical marine habitats and fish stocks, however, are vulnerable to the
   physical and biogeochemical oceanic changes associated with rising
   greenhouse gases. These changes to fish stocks, and subsequent impacts
   on fish production, have substantial implications for the UN Sustainable
   Development Goals. In this Review, we synthesize the effects of climate
   change on tropical marine fisheries, highlighting the socio-economic
   impacts to both tropical and extratropical nations, and discuss
   potential adaptation measures. Driven by ocean warming, acidification,
   deoxygenation and sea-level rise, the maximum catch potential of
   tropical fish stocks in some tropical exclusive economic zones is
   projected to decline by up to 40\% by the 2050s under the RCP8.5
   emissions scenario, relative to the 2000s. Climate-driven reductions in
   fisheries production and alterations in fish-species composition will
   subsequently increase the vulnerability of tropical countries with
   limited adaptive capacity. Thus, given the billions of people dependent
   on tropical marine fisheries in some capacity, there is a clear need to
   account for the effects of climate change on these resources and
   identify practical adaptations when building climate-resilient
   sustainable-development pathways.
   Stressors arising from anthropogenic climate change threaten tropical
   fisheries and, in turn, those extratropical nations reliant on them.
   This Review discusses the impact of climate change on tropical fish
   stocks and catch potential, the corresponding telecoupling and
   subsequent adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services provided by wetlands on agricultural landscapes
   include fish and wildlife habitat support, mitigation of pollution
   effects, water conservation, and climate change mitigation. Riparian
   buffer practices are also considered in this synthesis due to their
   implementation in wetlands or effects on wetland ecosystem service
   provisioning when implemented adjacent to wetlands. Conservation
   practices are most extensive in the first three of the following seven
   regions analyzed: Mississippi Alluvial Valley, Glaciated Interior
   Plains, Piedmont-Coastal Plain, Prairie Pothole Region, California
   Central Valley, Appalachia, and the High Plains. Of the eight dominant
   practices available to establish and manage wetlands, the three most
   prevalent are Wetland Establishment, Wetland Management, and Riparian
   Buffer establishment and management. Differences in physiography among
   regions strongly influence the types of practices commonly applied.
   Highly altered drainage patterns and nutrient loading common to
   agriculture can make wetland establishment difficult. Nutrient
   enrichment, especially with nitrogen, can create trade-offs between
   reduced export of nutrients downstream (e. g., nitrate) and enhanced
   greenhouse gas emissions (e. g., nitrous oxide). Guidance is needed that
   considers the full array of ecosystem functions and services of multiple
   practices across a range of spatial scales. Both positive and negative
   effects need to be addressed given the trade-offs between enhancement of
   ecosystem services and the lack of knowledge of thresholds at which
   ecosystem functions are no longer ecologically or economically
   sustainable. In many cases, data are not presently available, nor is
   there a suitable monitoring process in place to assess the long-term
   effects of agriculture on additional wetlands and the potential services
   they provide, and vice versa. This points to the need to better match
   practices with goals, to evaluate restoration costs and benefits, and to
   optimize how decision-making is distributed between national and local
   levels.},

Title = {Challenges to select suitable habitats and demonstrate `additionality'
   in Blue Carbon projects: A seagrass case study},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Seagrass restoration has been suggested as a Blue Carbon (BC) strategy
   for climate change mitigation. For Nationally Determined Contributions
   (NDC) and carbon crediting schemes, BC projects need to demonstrate
   `additionality', that is enhanced CO2 sequestration and/or avoided
   greenhouse gas emissions following management actions. This typically
   requires determining soil carbon accumulation rates (CAR), which is
   often done using radionuclides or surface elevation tables to estimate
   sedimentation rates. Here we undertook a case study, using Pb-210 and
   C-14 dating, to detect possible changes in C-org stocks and CAR
   following the loss and partial recovery of Posidonia seagrass meadows in
   South Australia since 1980-90s. The Pb-210 data revealed a lack of
   accumulation of excess Pb-210 in most sites, suggesting negligible
   accumulation of sediments, intense mixing of the upper layers, or
   accumulation of reworked sediments, precluding the estimation of
   reliable CAR at decadal time scales. This limitation was also
   encountered with C-14. The inability to compare sites over analogous
   periods of time prevented quantifying differences in soil C org
   sequestration, thereby to demonstrate additionality. The lack of
   significant differences in soil C org stocks among sites which never
   suffered seagrass loss, those showing recovery and those with no
   recovery (5.7 +/- 1.2, 4.5 +/- 0.7 and 3.3 +/- 0.3 kg C-org, m(-)(2)
   within the top meter, respectively) also precluded estimates of soil C
   org gains or losses. Our findings demonstrate that, while Pb-210 and
   C-14 provide important information on sediment deposition dynamics, it
   is not straightforward to demonstrate additionality using radionuclides
   in low depositional seagrass habitats exposed to hydrodynamic energy,
   features which may be encountered in seagrass sites. We provide insights
   for the selection of suitable habitats for seagrass BC projects, suggest
   possible alternative methods for estimating additionality, and discuss
   the implications of the findings for the implementation of seagrass BC
   strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.},

Abstract = {An assessment of the vulnerability to sea level rise and climate change
   was performed for island countries in the South Pacific (Tonga, Fiji,
   Samoa, and Tuvalu) under the collaboration of Japanese experts and the
   South Pacific Regional Environment Programme. A combination of
   experience-based and scientific methods were developed to reveal the
   overall vulnerability of and possible impacts on the coastal zone
   sectors. The studies identified the common impacts on and vulnerability
   of these countries. Inundation and flooding are the common threats to
   these islands because, of their low-lying setting; the problem is
   exacerbated by the social trends of population growth and migration to
   main islands, in particular to the capital cities. Other threats include
   beach erosion, saltwater intrusion, and impacts on the infrastructure
   and coastal society. For the island countries, the response to sea level
   rise and climate change focuses on adaptation rather than on reduction
   of greenhouse gas emissions (that is, mitigation). Based on the results
   of the vulnerability assessment, the concept of and options for
   adaptation are also discussed.},

Title = {Environmental benefits of an alternative practice for sugarcane
   cultivation using Gracilaria-based seaweed biostimulant},
Journal = {SUGAR TECH},
Abstract = {Modelling of sugarcane for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation has evoked
   considerable interest as it would provide a scope for improving process
   efficiencies and reduce the burden on associated impacts. Alternative
   practices are essential for enhancing cane production with limited
   environmental trade-offs. The aim of this study was to empirically prove
   that the inclusion of Gracilaria-based seaweed extract (GSWE) as
   biostimulant in cane production as an alternate practice is
   environmentally friendlier. A field experiment was carried out at Indian
   Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow, India, for two consecutive
   years in a randomized block design to evaluate the inclusion of GSWE in
   the agricultural practice for cane production. Environmental benefits of
   using GSWE were deduced and normalized with yield following modelling.
   The results showed inclusion of GSWE at >= 5\% concentration in the
   agricultural practice enhanced cane yield by at least 8\% in plant and
   ratoon crops leading to higher returns. This was primarily driven by
   increase in cane length, cane weight and the number of millable canes.
   Notably, the N use efficiency of the crop was enhanced. Modelling
   revealed that 5\% GSWE application resulted in favourable benefits in 16
   categories out of a total of 18 categories measured. GHG mitigation was
   prominent as evidenced by a gain in climate change impact category which
   was 2.17 kg CO2 equivalents (eq) for Mg of cane production when GSWE was
   applied at 5\%. The novelty of the present study was to quantify the
   environmental benefits of the use of Gracilaria-based seaweed
   biostimulant in the agricultural practice for cane cultivation. The
   biostimulant can enhance yield by increasing the N use efficiency of
   sugarcane, effectively lowering the potential for N losses, thus
   mitigating not only GHGs but also other impact categories.},

Title = {A comprehensive overview of environmental footprints of water
   desalination and alleviation strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Abstract = {Desalination is considered the most practiced method to overcome the
   mounting pressure of water scarcity. Regardless of outstanding
   performance and manifold advantages presented by desalination, growing
   concerns about its environmental footprints cannot be overlooked. Reject
   brine disposal releases numerous antifoaming, fouling resistance,
   antiscalants, antiturbidity, and corrosion inhibition additives into the
   marine environment; entrapment, entrainment, and impingement of marine
   organisms in water intake systems besides intensive energy usage which
   inextricably interwoven with air pollution, greenhouse gasses emission
   and noise pollution are major environmental adverse effects of
   desalination systems. This paper comprehensively explores aforesaid
   impacts besides offering several case-specific mitigative strategies
   like water/energy recovery, environmental impact assessment (EIA), CO2
   sequestration, careful selection of land, careful intake and outfall
   design, brine mining, brine treatment, and application of green
   desalination technologies to countervail and minimize those undesirable
   environmental footprints. In this context, several green desalination
   technologies like functional water channels, gas hydrate-based
   desalination, energy recovery, hybrid desalination, renewable
   energy-based systems and temperature swing solvent extraction were
   discussed. Moreover, several brine mining methods were presented to
   simultaneously take advantage of the presence of precious materials in
   the reject brine stream, which can be advantageous from an economic
   standpoint. To ensure the removal of any potentially negative influences
   of desalination on human beings and the environment, conduction of
   stringent monitoring procedures is strongly crucial. Finally, it
   concludes that with considerable technical advancements in conventional
   desalination technologies and conduction of cutting-edge desalination
   systems along with the application of renewable energy sources,
   achieving a pollution-free and sustainable operation is reasonably
   sensible.

Abstract = {Australia's aquatic ecosystems are unique, supporting a high diversity
   of species and high levels of endemism; however, they are also extremely
   vulnerable to climate change. The present review assesses
   climate-induced changes to structural habitats that have occurred in
   different aquatic ecosystems. Climatic impacts are often difficult to
   discern against the background of habitat degradation caused by more
   direct anthropogenic impacts. However, climate impacts will become more
   pronounced with ongoing changes in temperature, water chemistry, sea
   level, rainfall patterns and ocean currents. Each of these factors is
   likely to have specific effects on ecosystems, communities or species,
   and their relative importance varies across different marine and
   freshwater habitats. In the Murray-Darling Basin, the greatest concern
   relates to declines in surface water availability and riverine flow,
   owing to declining rainfall and increased evaporative loss. On the Great
   Barrier Reef, increasing temperatures and ocean acidification contribute
   to sustained and ongoing loss of habitat-forming corals. Despite the
   marked differences in major drivers and consequences of climate change,
   the solution is always the same. Greenhouse-gas emissions need to be
   reduced as a matter of urgency, while also minimising non-climatic
   disturbances. Together, these actions will maximise opportunities for
   adaptation by species and increase ecosystem resilience.},

Title = {Global challenges and adaptations in management practices to preserve
   soil carbon pool with changing climate},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {77},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Increasing CO2 levels and its consequent effects have been prominent
   with climate change. Three out of ten transgressed planetary boundaries
   reflect our planet's status at tipping point. Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)
   which helps soil supply water and nutrients to plants through roots is
   inherently related to various ecological systems and needs urgent
   attention. Although the total SOC globally is more than the total carbon
   in biosphere and atmosphere, the vulnerability of SOC due to
   anthropogenic activities is unavoidable. The environmental factors
   affecting sequestration of SOC, soil fertility, crop production,
   accelerated SOC removal with rising temperatures, green-house gases
   emissions and climate change are interrelated. Thus, it is impossible to
   understand and estimate the various scenarios of impacts on SOC pool
   with ever-changing ecosystems and related processes in soil environment
   completely. Based on currently predicted climate change scenarios, if
   deforestation is controlled and reestablishment is achieved, tropical
   forests can trap atmospheric CO2 in the cheapest way and function as the
   largest sink on earth. The agricultural management practices (AMPs),
   which have been practiced in the last two decades and found helpful are
   suitable. However, some innovative adaptations such as crop modelling,
   selecting types of residue to change microbial communities, practices of
   grassland-grazing and low-C-emission AMPs are also necessary. To achieve
   the millennium development goals, we must accomplish food security,
   which relates all 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) also relays
   agricultural systems, soil systems, ecosystem services, soil fertility
   and how best we nurture SOC pool with supportive AMPs.},

Title = {Climate Change and Drying of Agricultural Products},
Journal = {DRYING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {629-635},
Abstract = {Global warming is affecting the world and will continue to affect humans
   and the ecosystem in the future, in different regions of the earth in
   diverse ways: air temperature rise, modifications in the precipitation
   and snow/ice melting rates, sea level rise, changes in geographical
   distribution, and even extinction of some plants and animals. In
   particular, the predictions presented in the 2007 Report of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Working Group 1 (available at
   www.ipcc.ch) for the mean temperature increase in the present century is
   about (31)C/century for a middle range scenario of human behavior.
   Mitigation measures need to be taken urgently in all aspects of
   activities in order to reduce the future impact of the temperature
   augmentation. In particular, the drying process (as well as the pre- and
   post-drying operations) needs to be reanalyzed, in order to try to
   participate in this world effort to reduce the impact of anthropogenic
   activities that introduce in the atmosphere an excess of greenhouse
   gases (GHG). The energy savings, use of renewable energies, optimization
   of each part of the drying process, and use of control devices for
   detecting and minimizing the atmospheric injection of GHG are some of a
   large number of possible actions to be taken in this respect. A nice
   example of how a planetary problem can be solved with the global
   participation of scientists, professionals, authorities and general
   public is the stopping of the destruction of the ozone layer and its
   possible recuperation in the near future, as discussed in the WMO
   related report (Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2006, that can
   be obtained at
   http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/ozone2006/ozoneasstreport.html).{

Abstract = {Governments face the daunting task of developing policies and making
   investment decisions for climate change adaptation in an environment
   that consist of complex, interlinked systems with manifold
   uncertainties. Instead of responding to surprises and making decisions

   uncertainties can provide indispensable support for policy making. This
   contribution proposes a structured approach for designing climate
   adaptation policies based on the concepts of Adaptation Pathways,
   Adaptive Policy Making, and Real Options Analysis. Such an approach
   results in incorporation of flexibility that allows change over time in
   response to how the future unfolds, what is learned about the system,
   and changes in societal preferences. The approach is illustrated by
   looking at drainage policies and measures to address flooding in

Title = {Impacts and adaptation to climate change in Malaysian real estate},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-103},
Abstract = {Purpose - There is a growing concern in recent years regarding climate
   change risks to real estate in the developed and developing countries.
   It is anticipated that the property sector could be affected by variable
   climate and related extremes as well as by the strategies adopted to
   combat greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper aims to analyse the
   current knowledge regarding future climate changes to understand their
   possible impacts on the real estate sector of Malaysia with an aim to
   help stakeholders to adopt necessary responses to reduce negative
   impacts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Available literature is reviewed and data
   related to climatic influences on buildings and structures are analysed
   to understand the climate change impacts on real estate in Malaysia.
   Findings - The study reveals that temperature in the Peninsular Malaysia
   will increase by 1.1 to 3.6 degrees C, rainfall will be more variable
   and river discharge in some river basins will increase up to 43 per cent
   during the northeast monsoon season by the end of this century. These
   changes in turn will pose risks of property damage and increase property
   lifecycle costs. Furthermore, property prices and the overall growth of
   the property sector may be affected by the government policy of GHG
   emission reduction by up to 45 per cent by the year 2030. This study
   concludes that the property sector of Malaysia will be most affected by
   the implementation of GHG emission reduction policy in the short term
   and due to the physical risk posed by variable climate and related
   extremes in the long term.
   Originality/value - The study in general will assist in guiding the
   operational responses of various authorities, especially in terms of
   those interventions aimed at climate change risk reduction in the
   property sector of Malaysia.},

Title = {Data-driven offshore CO(2 )saline storage assessment methodology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The world produces approximately 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases
   annually. This is measured in CO2-equivalents, and geologic CO2 storage
   has the potential to advance decarbonization and mitigate greenhouse gas
   emissions. New technologies to assess offshore carbon storage are needed
   to address resource, regulatory, and commercial needs. Although most
   efforts to assess storage resources focus on onshore criteria, offshore
   reservoirs offer significant storage potential and distinct development
   challenges. Potential advantages of offshore carbon storage include
   being further from human population centers and less potential to
   interact with groundwater. The U.S. Department of Energy's method for
   evaluating storage capacity in non-oil-bearing saline reservoirs has
   been enhanced to support assessments for offshore environments in the
   Offshore CO2 Saline Storage method-ology (OCSS). This methodology
   applies data-driven capabilities to estimate saline storage capacity
   while ac-counting for features specific to offshore reservoirs. Features
   include changes in CO2 density and sedimentary differences that impact
   estimates of permanence and capacity. The Offshore CO2 Saline Storage
   Calculator mechanizes OCSS to estimate storage capacity. This paper
   presents the methodology and estimates for 18 geologic domains in the
   Gulf of Mexico. Potential storage distributions, sensitivity analyses,
   and the incorpo-ration of spatial data and tools to support safe site
   selection are also discussed.},

Title = {Achieving deep reductions in US transport greenhouse gas emissions:
   Scenario analysis and policy implications},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the potential for making deep cuts in US
   transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the long-term (50-80\%
   below 1990 levels by 2050). Scenarios are used to envision how such a
   significant decarbonization might be achieved through the application of
   advanced vehicle technologies and fuels, and various options for
   behavioral change. A Kaya framework that decomposes GHG emissions into
   the product of four major drivers is used to analyze emissions and
   mitigation options. In contrast to most previous studies, a relatively
   simple, easily adaptable modeling methodology is used which can
   incorporate insights from other modeling studies and organize them in a
   way that is easy for policymakers to understand. Also, a wider range of
   transportation subsectors is considered here-light- and heavy-duty
   vehicles, aviation, rail, marine, agriculture, off-road, and
   construction. This analysis investigates scenarios with multiple options
   (increased efficiency, lower-carbon fuels, and travel demand management)
   across the various subsectors and confirms the notion that there are no
   ``silver bullet{''} strategies for making deep cuts in transport GHGs.
   If substantial emission reductions are to be made, considerable action
   is needed on all fronts, and no subsectors can be ignored. Light-duty
   vehicles offer the greatest potential for emission reductions; however,
   while deep reductions in other subsectors are also possible, there are
   more limitations in the types of fuels and propulsion systems that can
   be used. In all cases travel demand management strategies are critical;
   deep emission cuts will not likely be possible without slowing growth in
   travel demand across all modes. Even though these scenarios represent
   only a small subset of the potential futures in which deep reductions
   might be achieved, they provide a sense of the magnitude of changes
   required in our transportation system and the need for early and
   aggressive action if long-term targets are to be met. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {In this interview, climate scientist Tom Wigley says that waiting to
   take significant action on climate change makes it more likely that
   geoengineering will be needed to address the problem. He advocates for
   research on a combination approach: climate engineering together with
   mitigation efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Wigley
   says that geoengineering may become necessary to stabilize global sea
   level rise, because sea level has much greater inertia than temperatures
   in the atmosphere. He argues that the climate problem cannot be solved
   with renewable energy alone, and that, without turning to
   geoengineering, consideration of the nuclear energy pathway-in
   particular, resuming the development of fast reactors-should be an
   essential component of attempts to address the climate crisis. Wigley
   claims that his colleagues in climate science are generally supportive
   of nuclear engineering and less fearful of it than they are of
   geoengineering.},

Abstract = {The development and implementation of strategies for CO2 mitigation are
   necessary to counteract the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide
   emissions. To demonstrate the possibility of simultaneously capturing
   CO2 and utilizing four-carbon compounds, an integrated system using CA
   and PEPCase was developed, which mimics an in vivo carbon dioxide
   concentration mechanism. We first cloned the PEPCase 1 gene of the
   marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and produced a recombinant
   PtPEPCase 1. The affinity column purified PtPEPCase 1 exhibited specific
   enzymatic activity (5.89 U/mg). When the simultaneous and coordinated
   reactions of CA from Dunaliella sp. and the PtPEPCase 1 occurred, more
   OAA was produced than when only PEPCase was present. Therefore, this
   integrated CA-PEPCase system can be used not only to capture CO2 but
   also for a new technology to produce value-added four-carbon platform
   chemicals.},

   change, its impacts and some adaptation strategies, focusing on
   ecosystem-based adaptation strategies from Belgium and The Netherlands
   and Water-Sensitive Urban Design approaches developed in Australia. The
   article engages a case study of Essenvelt, Middelburg, The Netherlands,
   where unanticipated warmer night-time temperatures are a primary
   concern, related to natural variability, the urban heat island effect
   and climate change. The article proposes certain adaptation measures for
   Essenvelt, based on the adaptation strategies reviewed.},

   fewer impacts than polypropylene fibres. The results revealed that the
   use of the Alfa fibres reinforced concretes is efficient solution for
   climate change mitigation, for the reason that they generate: (1) a less
   fossil fuel depletion; (2) produce lower emissions of greenhouse gases;
   (3) develop a lesser atmospheric emission of particles, (4) reduce the
   marine ecotoxicity; and (5) participate in decreasing the photochemical

Title = {Adaptation strategies for climate change impacts on water quality: a
   systematic review of the literature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Abstract = {Climate change will impact water bodies and create significant
   challenges for natural resource managers. Despite the increasing impacts
   of climate change on water quality, the development and implementation
   of long-term strategic adaptation measures are seldom governmental
   priorities. So far, research has mainly tended to focus on the
   availability and volume of water rather than the quality. Comparatively
   fewer studies have considered adaptation strategies that deal with the
   uncertainties of the impacts of climate change on the quality of water
   bodies. This paper reports the results of a systematic review of
   literature on adaptation options and the barriers and drivers that can
   exert a positive or negative influence on their implementation. Findings
   suggest that there has been and continues to be a cautious approach to a
   growing concern for a natural resource of utmost necessity. Most of the
   strategies mentioned in the literature use coping or incremental
   approaches. However, adaptation strategies offering low levels of
   resilience for addressing water quality may not be up to the challenge
   of significant future climate changes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {95},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1801-1812},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector and it
   contributes significantly to global food security. Based on Food and
   Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, aquaculture
   production must increase significantly to meet the future global demand
   for aquatic foods in 2050. According to Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) and FAO, climate change may result in global
   warming, sea level rise, changes of ocean productivity, freshwater
   shortage, and more frequent extreme climate events. Consequently,
   climate change may affect aquaculture to various extents depending on
   climatic zones, geographical areas, rearing systems, and species farmed.
   There are 2 major challenges for aquaculture caused by climate change.
   First, the current fish, adapted to the prevailing environmental
   conditions, may be suboptimal under future conditions. Fish species are
   often poikilothermic and, therefore, may be particularly vulnerable to
   temperature changes. This will make low sensitivity to temperature more
   important for fish than for livestock and other terrestrial species.
   Second, climate change may facilitate outbreaks of existing and new
   pathogens or parasites. To cope with the challenges above, 3 major
   adaptive strategies are identified. First, general `robustness' will
   become a key trait in aquaculture, whereby fish will be less vulnerable
   to current and new diseases while at the same time thriving in a wider
   range of temperatures. Second, aquaculture activities, such as input
   power, transport, and feed production contribute to greenhouse gas
   emissions. Selection for feed efficiency as well as defining a breeding
   goal that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions will reduce impacts of
   aquaculture on climate change. Finally, the limited adoption of breeding
   programs in aquaculture is a major concern. This implies inefficient use
   of resources for feed, water, and land. Consequently, the carbon
   footprint per kg fish produced is greater than when fish from breeding
   programs would be more heavily used. Aquaculture should use genetically
   improved and robust organisms not suffering from inbreeding depression.
   This will require using fish from well-managed selective breeding
   programs with proper inbreeding control and breeding goals. Policymakers
   and breeding organizations should provide incentives to boost selective
   breeding programs in aquaculture for more robust fish tolerating
   climatic change.},

Title = {Fisheries management approaches as platforms for climate change
   adaptation: Comparing theory and practice in Australian fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {82-93},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study examines the extent to which the choice of management
   approach is a critical factor in enabling climate change adaptation in
   marine fisheries. Climate change is expected to compound many pressing
   issues affecting fisheries management. Good governance of fisheries,
   which is critical to building their adaptive capacity and
   social-ecological resilience, is seen as ever more important in the
   context of climate change. A range of fisheries management approaches
   have been developed and, to varying degrees, applied. Each has been
   described in the literature as a promising way to manage marine
   resources. Through literature reviews and a survey of practitioners,
   this study explores how theoretical properties of selected major
   management approaches (i.e., ecosystem-based management, adaptive
   management, co-management, adaptive co-management, and active adaptive
   management) enable climate change adaptation, and how such properties
   are perceived by practitioners to manifest in practice using an
   Australian marine fisheries context. Overall, the selected management
   approaches have the potential to enable climate change adaptation to
   varying degrees. Ecosystem-based management, in combination with
   adaptive management and co-management as nested management approaches,
   possesses the full array of adaptation capacities and attributes
   required for adaptation in fisheries. Distinctions between theory and
   practice observed in this study highlight the importance of practitioner
   perceptions and enabling institutional arrangements in adapting
   management to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Climate change and New Zealand's groundwater resources: A methodology to
   support adaptation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Study region: Hawke's Bay and Otago regions, North and South Islands,
   New Zealand (NZ). Study focus: Evidence that climate change affects
   groundwater is emerging, but a complete un-derstanding of the processes
   and impacts on the resources remains limited in most countries,
   including NZ. This paper presents a methodology to explore the potential
   effects of climate change on groundwater for an envelope of future
   climate scenarios (i.e., low and high greenhouse gas emissions; mid-and
   end-century). The methodology uses national and sub-national datasets
   and models and is applied to two case studies (Hawke's Bay and Otago).
   Its structure allows for future implementation in other NZ regions.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Results are provided as
   projected changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration, rainfall
   recharge to groundwater (RR) and water table elevation. General water
   quantity reductions are projected for Hawke's Bay (e.g., RR reduced by
   up to-1.5 mm/d), and more limited and variable changes for Otago (e.g.,
   RR varying between +/-0.4 mm/ d).
   We then present a discussion about furthering the science of climate
   change effects on ground-water, characterisation of climate change
   uncertainty and unique effects, and adaptation in the NZ context. We
   anticipate that our results, despite limitations and uncertainty, can
   enable adaptation actions without delay. We recommend integrated and
   adaptive approaches, including action effectiveness monitoring and
   community engagement, to develop resilience to climate change threats.},

Title = {Extreme sea level rise along the Indian Ocean coastline: observations
   and 21st century projections},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic sea-level rise poses challenges to coastal areas globally.
   The combined influence of rising mean sea level (MSL) and storm surges
   exacerbate the extreme sea level (ESL). Increasing ESL poses a major
   challenge for climate change adaptation of nearly 2.6 billion
   inhabitants in the Indian Ocean region. Yet, knowledge about past
   occurrences of ESL and its progression is limited. Combining multiple
   tide-gauge and satellite-derived sea-level data, we show that ESL has
   become more frequent, longer-lasting and intense along the Indian Ocean
   coastlines. We detect a 2-3-fold increase in ESL occurrence, with higher
   risk along the Arabian Sea coastline and the Indian Ocean Islands. Our
   results reveal that rising MSL is the primary contributor to ESL
   increase (more than 75\%), with additional contribution from
   intensifying tropical cyclones. A two-fold increase in ESL along the
   Indian Ocean coastline is detected with an additional 0.5 degrees C
   warming of the Indian Ocean relative to pre-industrial levels. Utilizing
   the likely range (17th-83rd percentile as the spread) of
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change MSL projections with
   considerable inter-model spread, we show that the Indian Ocean region
   will be exposed annually to the present-day 100 year ESL event by 2100,
   irrespective of the greenhouse-gas emission pathways, and by 2050 under
   the moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario. The study provides a
   robust regional estimate of ESL and its progression with rising MSL,
   which is important for climate change adaptation policies.},

Abstract = {In terms of evaluating possible adaptations to climate change, one
   problem faced by decision-makers is how to separate the risks from
   present, natural climatic variations and extremes from those associated
   with future greenhouse-gas-induced changes in climate. In particular,
   this separation is necessary in order to identify the ``incremental
   costs{''} of adaptation associated with climate change. As reported
   here, this problem has been addressed by developing an enhanced version
   of an integrated model system called SimCLIM.
   The SimCLIM system simulates, both temporally and spatially, the impacts
   of both climate variability and change. The model system has recently
   been expanded in ways that allow the topic of ``incremental costs{''} of
   adaptation to be explored through simulation, with a particular focus on
   coastal risks. These improvements include:
   open-framework system, which allows user access to import climate data
   and impact models for different areas and resolutions;
   sea-level scenario generator, which includes the capacity for including
   regional and local components of sea-level change;
   land use scenario generator that allows the user to examine the
   implications for vulnerability under assumptions about different
   pathways and controls on future growth and development;
   capacity for transient simulations that complements the ``time-slice{''}
   approach to impact assessment and allows for time-dependent changes in
   climate and land use and their effects to be analysed;
   explicit capacity for examining adaptation options, including outputs
   that allow comparisons of simulations with and without climate change;
   economic tools for evaluation of impacts and adaptation options,
   specifically focussing on economic costs and benefits.
   This paper describes these improvements to SimCLIM and demonstrates
   their application through a pilot study of coastal flood risk from
   tropical cyclones in a community on the island of Rarotonga, Cook
   Islands. Multiple simulations are conducted with and without climate
   change, and with and without adaptation. The results thereby give clear
   indications of the relative magnitude of present and future impacts of
   tropical cyclones and the relative costs and benefits of adaptation
   options for reducing the risks.},

Abstract = {Waste management strategies have a relevant role in climate change
   mitigation. This work presents the cost-effectiveness analysis of
   implementing a composting plant and a landfill, with and without
   electricity generation, in Cabo Verde. The measures were initially
   selected under local stakeholder consultation under the Waste Roadmap of
   Cabo Verde project development, as well as all technical assumptions.
   The analysis was developed using the GACMO model, to build a marginal
   revenue abatement curve. The waste composting solution for large
   producers presents the largest volume of GHG emissions saved, 81
   ktCO(2)eq./year, at a low cost of 0.62 US\$/tCO(2)eq., thus supporting
   its implementation. In complement, the landfill gas electricity
   production shows positive yields of 40 US\$/tCO(2)eq., with savings of
   about 36ktCO(2)eq. per year, contributing to the greenhouse gas emission
   reduction targets of the country. The landfill gas flaring solution
   shows higher costs since it does not benefit from electricity
   generation. Following the Waste Roadmap development, these results are
   being considered in the definition of waste management operational plans
   in the various islands of the country.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {741},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to quantify carbon stocks and the emission of
   the greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4) in mangrove forests with different
   vegetation assemblies in coastal lagoons of Veracruz Mexico. The
   vegetation included: black mangrove BM, dominated by Avicennia
   germinans, white mangrove WM, dominated by Laguncularia. racemose, red
   mangrove RM, dominated by Rhizophora mangle and mixed mangrove MM,
   dominated by the three species. Soil C stocks ranged 187-671 Mg C ha(-1)
   without significant (p = 0.149) differences among the mangroves with
   different vegetation. Significantly (p = 0.049) higher tree biomass C
   stock was observed in RM (127 Mg ha(-1)) than in MM (24.23 Mg ha(-1)).
   Methane emissions in RM (0.58-6.03 mg m-2 min-1) were significantly
   higher (p b 0.05) than in MM. (0.0035-0.07 mg m(-2) min(-1)), in WM
   (-0.0026-0.029 mg m(-2) min(-1)) and in BM (0.0054-0.0097 mg m(-2)
   min(-1)),during rainy, windy and dry season.RM had the longest period of
   inundation, the highest soil carbon concentration, and the lowest
   salinity. CH4 emissions showed a significantly positive correlation with
   soils carbon concentration, water level and water pH and, negative
   correlation with water salinity and Cl-1 concentration in soil and
   water. Emissions of N2O (0.04-3.25 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) were not
   significantly different among the mangroves with different vegetation,
   but they showed seasonal variations, with higher emissions during windy
   and dry seasons. N2O emissions showed significantly positive
   correlations with soil nitrate concentration and soil temperature.
   Results of this research are useful for mangrove conservation and
   restoration strategies to maximize carbon storage and mitigate
   greenhouse gas emissions. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Indonesia is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change due
   to its coastlines, high concentration of population and economic
   activity in coastal areas. In addition, the impacts of climate change
   have had severe environmental and socio-economic consequences.
   Adaptation measures are required to minimize the impacts. Some climate
   change adaptation measures have been practiced in the coastal cities of
   Indonesia. This article aims to examine the current practices and
   performance of local adaptation measures in the coastal city of Semarang
   City. The current adaptation practices include an integration of climate
   resilience strategy into city planning and a physical adaptation
   strategy for the tidal flood hazard. It is found that the performance of
   each adaptation measures has different outcomes depending on the
   typology of adaptation. Cooperation and a strong commitment amongst
   stakeholders as well as building adaptive capacity of local people and

Abstract = {The maritime transport industry continues to draw international
   attention on significant Greenhouse Gas emissions. The introduction of
   emissions taxes aims to control and reduce emissions. The uncertainty of
   carbon tax policy affects shipping companies' fleet planning and
   increases costs. We formulate the fleet planning problem under carbon
   tax policy uncertainty a multi-stage stochastic integer-programming
   model for the liner shipping companies. We develop a scenario tree to
   represent the structure of the carbon tax stochastic dynamics, and seek
   the optimal planning, which is adaptive to the policy uncertainty.
   Non-anticipativity constraint is applied to ensure the feasibility of
   the decisions in the dynamic environment. For the sake of comparison,
   the Perfect Information (PI) model is introduced as well. Based on a
   liner shipping application of our model, we find that under the policy
   uncertainty, companies charter more ships when exposed to high carbon
   tax risk, and spend more on fleet operation; meanwhile the CO2 emission
   volume will be reduced.},

Title = {Exploring the contribution of climate change policies to integrated
   coastal zone management in Brazil},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The lawmaking body plays an important role in developing comprehensive
   policies and regulations that integrate aspects of climate mitigation
   and adaptation, and disaster risk reduction. The present research aims
   to understand how the effects of climate change in coastal areas have
   been addressed in the Brazilian policies and normative framework. A
   thorough review was carried out to identify and evaluate the main
   legislative documents and proposed management instruments available.
   Although only about half of the documents include detailed and explicit
   coastal guidelines, the analyzed normative framework presented a
   comprehensive scope that enables managers to tailor actions to their
   particular needs on the littoral. Policies addressing climate challenges
   are concentrated on a national scale. For instance, financial support
   actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions stand out, such as the
   economic resources presented by the National Climate Change Fund. Along
   the same lines, both the National Disaster Protection Policy and the
   Sectoral Plan for Sea Resources point out how the process of climate
   adaptation and disaster risk reduction is fundamentally related to
   financial investment in Marine Sciences and the permanent ocean and
   meteorological monitoring. Regarding the management instruments, only 13
   are currently implemented, of which 10 explicitly address climate
   change. As an example, the Federal Coastal Zone Action Plan aims to
   establish future scenarios and subsidize adaptation strategies. In the
   state of Santa Catarina, the State Policy on Climate Change stands out
   as one of the most comprehensive available pieces of legislation, even
   though not specifically designed for the coastal zone.},

Title = {Probabilistic projections of the stability of small tidal inlets at
   century time scale using a reduced complexity approach},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Climate change is widely expected to affect the thousands of small tidal
   inlets (STIs) dotting the global coastline. To properly inform effective
   adaptation strategies for the coastal areas in the vicinity of these
   inlets, it is necessary to know the temporal evolution of inlet
   stability over climate change time scales (50-100 years). As available
   numerical models are unable to perform continuous morphodynamic
   simulations at such time scales, here we develop and pilot a fast,
   probabilistic, reduced complexity model (RAPSTA - RAPid assessment tool
   of inlet STAbility) that can also quantify forcing uncertainties. RAPSTA
   accounts for the key physical processes governing STI stability and for
   climate change driven variations in system forcing. The model is very
   fast, providing a 100 year projection in less than 3 seconds. RAPSTA is
   demonstrated here at 3 STIs, representing the 3 main Types of STIs;
   Permanently open, locationally stable inlet (Type 1); Permanently open,
   alongshore migrating inlet (Type 2); Seasonally/Intermittently open,
   locationally stable inlet (Type 3). Model applications under a high
   greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), accounting for forcing
   uncertainties, show that while the Type 1 STI will not change type over
   the twenty-first century, the Type 2 inlet may change into a more
   unstable Type 3 system around mid-century, and the Type 3 STI may change
   into a less unstable Type 2 system in about 20 years from now, further
   changing into a stable Type 1 STI around mid-century. These projections
   underscore the need for future adaptation strategies to remain flexible.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Number = {3-4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Changes in temperature, precipitation, sea level, and coastal storms
   will likely increase the vulnerability of infrastructure across the USA.
   Using models that analyze vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation, this
   paper estimates impacts to railroad, roads, and coastal properties under
   three infrastructure management response scenarios: No Adaptation;
   Reactive Adaptation, and Proactive Adaptation. Comparing damages under
   each of these potential responses provides strong support for
   facilitating effective adaptation in these three sectors. Under a high
   greenhouse gas emissions scenario and without adaptation, overall costs
   are projected to range in the \$100s of billions annually by the end of
   this century. The first (reactive) tier of adaptation action, however,
   reduces costs by a factor of 10, and the second (proactive) tier reduces
   total costs across all three sectors to the low \$10s of billions
   annually. For the rail and road sectors, estimated costs for Reactive
   and Proactive Adaptation scenarios capture a broader share of potential
   impacts, including selected indirect costs to rail and road users, and
   so are consistently about a factor of 2 higher than prior estimates. The
   results highlight the importance of considering climate risks in
   infrastructure planning and management.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The environment is increasingly affected by global climate change. While
   the causes of climate change are generated across the globe, the impacts
   of climate change will be highly variable at the local level. An
   increased scientific understanding of the potential impacts that climate
   change may have within China has raised new concern among China's
   leaders. Given that China's domestic realities inform its international
   policy choices, understanding how climate change may affect its
   population and natural resources is critical to global climate
   stabilization efforts. This article examines how the impacts of climate
   change on China, and China's response, will drive security challenges
   domestically, as well as in the greater Asian region and around the
   world. It shows that the impact of climate change on China will be
   significant and may have sizable adverse economic implications,
   particularly on vulnerable east coast economic centers. Water scarcity
   is a problem that already challenges China's leadership and one that
   will be exacerbated under projected climate impacts. In addition, the
   country faces the risk of international retaliation should it fail to
   undertake serious greenhouse gas mitigation actions. Yet China is not
   without options, and is already well poised to become a leader in the
   low-carbon technology revolution.},

Pages = {310-322},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {The environmental and health consequences of climate change, which
   disproportionately affect low-income countries and poor people in
   high-income countries, profoundly affect human rights and social
   justice. Environmental consequences include increased temperature,
   excess precipitation in some areas and droughts in others, extreme
   weather events, and increased sea level. These consequences adversely
   affect agricultural production, access to safe water, and worker
   productivity, and, by inundating land or making land uninhabitable and
   uncultivatable, will force many people to become environmental refugees.
   Adverse health effects caused by climate change include heat-related
   disorders, vector-borne diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases,
   respiratory and allergic disorders, malnutrition, collective violence,
   and mental health problems.
   These environmental and health consequences threaten civil and political
   rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, including rights to
   life, access to safe food and water, health, security, shelter, and
   culture. On a national or local level, those people who are most
   vulnerable to the adverse environmental and health consequences of
   climate change include poor people, members of minority groups, women,
   children, older people, people with chronic diseases and disabilities,
   those residing in areas with a high prevalence of climate-related
   diseases, and workers exposed to extreme heat or increased weather
   variability. On a global level, there is much inequity, with low-income
   countries, which produce the least greenhouse gases (GHGs), being more
   adversely affected by climate change than high-income countries, which
   produce substantially higher amounts of GHGs yet are less immediately
   affected. In addition, low-income countries have far less capability to
   adapt to climate change than high-income countries.
   Adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change needed to
   protect human society must also be planned to protect human rights,
   promote social justice, and avoid creating new problems or exacerbating
   existing problems for vulnerable populations.},

Title = {Development and appraisal of long-term adaptation pathways for managing
   heat-risk in London},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {73-92},
Abstract = {The risk of residential overheating and mortality is increasing due to
   the effects of global warming and the urban heat island effect and needs
   to be addressed through climate change adaptation. `Adaptation pathways'
   have become widely recognised as an adaptation planning approach, but
   they have not been utilised for long-term planning for city-scale urban
   heat risk management. This paper applies adaptation pathway methodology
   to urban heat risk management. We use spatially coherent downscaled
   probabilistic climate change projections that account for changes in
   urban-land cover and the urban heat island to appraise adaptation
   pathways and inform long-term adaptation planning. We demonstrate that
   adaptation strategies focusing solely on urban greening or building
   level adaptation based on current best practice are unlikely to cope
   with the increasing levels of risk. Air-conditioning may play a growing
   role in managing heat-risk; however, increasing air-conditioning will
   exacerbate the urban heat island and further increase the risks of
   overheating. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Title = {Implementation of underground longhole directional drilling technology
   for greenhouse gas mitigation in Chinese coal mines},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {290-303},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many Chinese coal mines are highly gassy with abundant coal mine methane
   occurring in complex geological conditions and emitted as a greenhouse
   gas into the atmosphere during mining operations. Major accidents due to
   coal and gas outbursts and gas explosions also frequently occur leading
   to fatalities and financial losses. Conventional technologies using
   specialized roadways and extensive short drilling holes are unable to
   meet the demand of today's high production mines with strict safety
   requirements and environmental regulations such as high carbon
   emissions. Longhole directional drilling technology has been widely
   employed in gassy mines due to its obvious advantages such as the high
   proportion of in-seam boreholes, high efficiency of gas drainage for gas
   mitigation and reduced cost associated with production down time. The
   effects were analysed and evaluated based on the application of
   introduced directional drilling equipment and techniques in Chinese coal
   mines. These results indicate that the complicated conditions involving
   soft broken coal, high in situ stress and the presence of faults and
   folds, present ongoing difficulties and challenges. Longhole directional
   drilling technology has been successfully applied in some Chinese coal
   mines for gas exploitation and coal mine gas emission mitigation. Daning
   Coal Mine (located in the southern Qinshui coalfields) and Baijigou Coal
   Mine are respectively extracting a thick coal seam. Both coal mines have
   deployed underground longhole in-seam directional drilling technology
   for seam gas extraction prior to mining operations. This technology has
   successfully achieved a high rate of gas recovery therefore reducing
   mine exhaust ventilation air methane (VAM). However there are still
   several limitations with the application of longholedirectional drilling
   technology. These include drilling difficulties in complex conditions,
   insufficient drill rod strength, poor gas drainage efficiency in low
   permeability coal seams and the inconsistency of the local Chinese-made
   equipment. Further studies include systematic evaluation of the drilling
   applicability within different geological conditions, improving
   equipment reliability, enhancing the permeability through protective
   seam mining, hydraulic fracturing and longhole pre-splitting blasting.
   Applications of directional drilling technology in Chinese gassy mines
   will make a significant contribution to the overall reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions from the coal mining industry. (c) 2012

Title = {Using quantitative dynamic adaptive policy pathways to manage climate
   change-induced coastal erosion},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {Adaptation requires planning strategies that consider the combined
   effect of climatic and nonclimatic drivers, which are deeply uncertain.
   This uncertainty arises from many sources, cascades and accumulates in
   risk estimates. A prominent trend to incorporate this uncertainty in
   adaptation planning is through adaptive approaches such as the dynamic
   adaptive policy pathways (DAPP). We present a quantitative DAPP
   application for coastal erosion management to increase its utilisation
   in this field. We adopt an approach in which adaptation objectives and
   actions have continuous quantitative metrics that evolve over time as
   conditions change. The approach hinges on an adaptation information
   system that comprises hazard and impact modelling and systematic
   monitoring to assess changing risks and adaptation signals in the light
   of adaptation pathway choices. Using an elaborated case study, we force
   a shoreline evolution model with waves and storm surges generated by
   means of stochastic modelling from 2010 to 2100, considering uncertainty
   in extreme weather events, climate variability and mean sea-level rise.
   We produce a new type of adaptation pathways map showing a set of
   90-year probabilistic trajectories that link changing objectives (e.g.,
   no adaptation, limit risk increase, avoid risk increase) and nourishment
   placement over time. This DAPP approach could be applied to other
   domains of climate change adaptation bringing a new perspective in
   adaptive planning under deep uncertainty.},

Title = {Management of Enteric Methanogenesis in Ruminants by Algal-Derived Feed
   Additives},
Journal = {CURRENT POLLUTION REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {188-205},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose of Review In this paper, we critically review the current state
   of nutritional management strategies to reduce methane emissions
   resulting from enteric fermentation in livestock production. In this
   context, it highlights the novel strategy regarding the use of
   macroalgal- and microalgal-derived feed additives. Recent Findings
   Several feed management strategies for ruminants focus on the inclusion
   of nutritional supplements, increasing proportion of starch, or
   supplementation with high-energy lipids. These strategies aim to improve
   animal productivity, whilst at the same time reduce methane emissions.
   Algae supplements are currently investigated as novel ingredients for
   decreasing methanogenesis, with the potential production of algal
   biomass also contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus,
   utilisation of algal biomass as a feed concentrate in dietary
   supplementation presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly
   strategy. This review summarises the current stage of research on
   dietary strategies and their influences on the metabolic processes
   during enteric fermentation. This information is essential for
   developing strategies to mitigate methane emissions in the livestock
   industry. We specifically present the opportunities that algae could
   offer as a feed additive for methanogenic reduction in cattle. The data
   compiled from the peer-reviewed literature revealed synergistic effects
   of algal biomass on methane reduction and animal productivity. However,
   the challenges regarding the mass cultivation of macro- and microalgae
   were noticed. Considering the diversity of algal species, future
   research should increase screening efforts to include more species and
   dosage evaluation, along with efforts to see if such effects are
   sustained over time.},

Title = {Technologies and perspectives for achieving carbon neutrality},
Journal = {INNOVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Global development has been heavily reliant on the overexploitation of
   natural resources since the Industrial Revolution. With the extensive
   use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other forms of land-use change,
   anthropogenic activities have contributed to the ever-increasing
   concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, causing
   global climate change. In response to the worsening global climate
   change, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is the most pressing task on
   the planet. To this end, it is of utmost importance and a significant
   challenge to reform the current production systems to reduce GHG
   emissions and promote the capture of CO2 from the atmosphere. Herein, we
   review innovative technologies that offer solutions achieving carbon (C)
   neutrality and sustainable development, including those for renewable
   energy production, food system transformation, waste valorization, C
   sink conservation, and C-negative manufacturing. The wealth of knowledge
   disseminated in this review could inspire the global community and drive
   the further development of innovative technologies to mitigate climate
   change and sustainably support human activities.},

Title = {Seasonal fluctuation in three mode of greenhouse gases emission in
   relation to soil labile carbon pools in degraded mangrove, Sundarban,
   India},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Tropical mangrove represents one of the most threatened ecosystems
   despite their huge contribution to ecosystem services, carbon (C)
   sequestration and climate change mitigation. Understanding the system in
   light of seasonal fluctuations on greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions due
   to human interferences and the tidal effect is important for devising
   site-specific real-time climate change mitigation strategies. In order
   to capture the seasonal variations, the three modes of transport of GHGs
   through pneumatophore, ebullition as bubbles and water-soluble diffusion
   was quantified. The three unique techniques for the gas collection were
   used to estimate the GHGs {[}methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and
   carbon dioxide (CO2)] emission, at three degraded-mangrove sites in
   Sundarban, India. We identified three degraded mangrove ecologies based
   on the remote sensing data of 1930 and 2013 (mangrove-covered area in
   Sundarban; 2387, 2136 km(2), respectively). Samples were collected and
   analyzed for four seasons {[}winter (November-January), summer
   (February-April), pre-monsoon (MayJune) and monsoon (July-October)], at
   three representative sites (Sadhupur, Dayapur, and Pakhiralaya).
   Monsoonal CH4 and CO2 fluxes (0353 +/- 0.026 and 64.5 +/- 6.1 mmol m(-2)
   d(-1), respectively) were higher than winter and summer. However, the
   soil labile C pools showed the opposite trend i.e. more in summer
   followed by winter and monsoon. In contrast, the N2O fluxes were more
   during summer (542 +/- 3.2 mu mol m(-2)d(-1)). The stagnant water had
   higher dissolved GHGs concentration compared to tidewater due to less
   salinity and a long time of stagnation. The mode of transport of GHGs
   through pneumatophore, ebullition, and water-soluble diffusion was also
   significantly varied with seasons, soil-carbon status and tidewater
   intrusion. Therefore, seasonal fluctuations of GHGs emission and tidal
   effect must be considered along with soil labile C pools for GHG-C
   budgeting and climate change mitigation in the mangrove ecosystem. (C)

Title = {Cooling the City? A Scientometric Study on Urban Green and Blue
   Infrastructure and Climate Change-Induced Public Health Effects},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change causes global effects on multiple levels. The
   anthropogenic input of greenhouse gases increases the atmospheric mean
   temperature. It furthermore leads to a higher probability of extreme
   weather events (e.g., heat waves, floods) and thus strongly impacts the
   habitats of humans, animals, and plants. Against this background,
   research and innovation activities are increasingly focusing on
   potential health-related aspects and feasible adaptation and mitigation
   strategies. Progressing urbanization and demographic change paired with
   the climate change-induced heat island effect exposes humans living in
   urban habitats to increasing health risks. By employing scientometric
   methods, this scoping study provides a systematic bird's eye view on the
   epistemic landscapes of climate change, its health-related effects, and
   possible technological and nature-based interventions and strategies in
   order to make urban areas climate proof. Based on a literature corpus
   consisting of 2614 research articles collected in SCOPUS, we applied
   network-based analysis and visualization techniques to map the different
   scientific communities, discourses and their interrelations. From a
   public health perspective, the results demonstrate the range of either
   direct or indirect health effects of climate change. Furthermore, the
   results indicate that a public health-related scientific discourse is
   converging with an urban planning and building science driven discourse
   oriented towards urban blue and green infrastructure. We conclude that
   this development might mirror the socio-political demand to tackle
   emerging climate change-induced challenges by transgressing disciplinary
   boundaries.},

Title = {How do regulated and voluntary carbon-offset schemes compare?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-50},
Abstract = {The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has become a key
   instrument for climate change mitigation. Parties with emission targets
   are using it to buy greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions for
   compliance against the Protocol's emission reduction targets. In
   parallel, the purchase of emission reductions through a voluntary carbon
   market has become a mainstream practice across business and individuals
   who, although not having any regulatory mandate, aim to offset their
   emissions. This voluntary market relies on mitigation projects which may
   or may not follow the standards of the CDM. This review compares these
   two instruments and traces similarities and differences in terms of
   project types, offset quality and contribution to sustainable
   development. It is shown that both mechanisms support a wide range of
   mitigation options and technologies, and differ considerably in the
   contribution of forestry and industrial gas offsets to their markets.
   There is not enough empirical data to assess the actual additionality
   and quality of produced offsets and their contribution to national and
   local sustainable development also requires further empirical
   assessment. Large scale mitigation options provide a substantial
   percentage of GHG reductions in both markets, with methane-based
   mitigation and fuel switching dominating over renewable investments such
   as solar and tidal. Africa remains the least benefited continent in both
   schemes. The review supports proposals towards reforming the CDM so that
   the least developed countries can also participate in a transition
   towards a decarbonised global society. Voluntary markets, in turn, are
   likely to remain driven by investors' willingness to support projects
   which are in line with poor countries' demands and priorities.},

Title = {The Mitigative Potential of Urban Environments and Their Microclimates},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cities play a crucial role in climate change: More than 50\% of the
   growing population lives in cities producing most of the global GDP but
   also 78\% of greenhouse gases (GHG) responsible for climate change.
   Moreover, due to their highly modified land-use and intensive
   activities, cities are at the forefront of the most rapid environmental
   and climatic change ever experienced by mankind. Yet, cities' potential
   to mitigate both climate change and their own environment is
   underexploited. This paper explores ideas related to the potential of
   urban environments to modify their microclimates, reflecting on the
   overlapping potential between mitigative and adaptive actions. These
   actions in cities can not only tackle some of the largest contributing
   factors to global climate change but offer short- to medium-term
   benefits that could drive more immediate socioeconomic and behavioral
   changes. This review proposes and discusses a new preliminary definition
   of urban environments as microclimate modifiers-Mitigative urban
   Environments and Microclimates (MitEM)-and calls for further research
   into: (a) inter-connecting the full range of mitigative and adaptive
   initiatives already being undertaken in many cities and maximizing their
   input systemically; (b) developing a common and holistic definition of
   MitEM; (c) promoting its uptake at policy level and amongst the key
   stakeholders, based on its social and public value beyond the
   environmental.},

Abstract = {Durban is unusual among cities worldwide in having a municipal
   government that has developed a locally rooted climate change adaptation
   strategy. This paper considers how climate change came to be considered
   by local government against four institutional markers: the emergence of
   climate change advocates among local politicians and civil servants;
   climate change as a significant issue in municipal plans; staff and
   funds allocated to climate change issues; and a serious consideration of
   climate change issues within local government decision making.
   Considerable progress has been achieved on the second and third of these
   - but less so on the first and fourth. The paper highlights how climate
   change issues need to be rooted in local realities that centre on
   avoiding or limiting impacts from, for instance, heat waves, heavy
   rainfall and storm surges and sea-level rise, and also the ecological
   changes and water supply constraints brought about by climate change. To
   date, international agencies have paid little attention to adaptation,
   as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) has been
   prioritized. This paper also stresses the importance of building local
   knowledge and capacity about climate change risks and adaptive
   responses. Without this, decision makers will continue seeing
   environmental issues as constraints on development rather than as
   essential underpinnings of and contributors to development.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {295},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Agricultural fields can be significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2),
   nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), with implications for climate
   change. This paper reports continuous half-hourly CO2, CH4 and N2O
   fluxes over a conventionally-managed highbush blueberry field on Westham
   Island in Delta, British Columbia (BC), Canada, measured using the
   eddy-covariance (EC) method for a 1-year period. Field management,
   including fertilization and mowing interrow grass, was associated with
   substantial changes in GHG exchange. With emissions of N2O and CH4
   totaling 0.61 +/- 0.03 g N2O m(-2) year(-1) and 0.81 +/- 0.4 g CH4 m(-2)
   year(-1), corresponding to 182 +/- 9 g and 30 +/- 13 g CO2 equivalent
   (CO(2)e) m year(-1), respectively, based on their 100-year global
   warming potentials, the field was a net source of 840 +/- 126 g CO(2)e
   m(-2) year(-1). The annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEEc) was the
   largest component of the GHG balance at 171 +/- 28 g C m(-2) year(-1)
   (628 +/- 104 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)), indicating the field was a net
   carbon (C) source. After accounting for inputs and outputs of C in
   sawdust and harvested fruit, respectively, the agroecosystem gained a
   net of 233 +/- 88 g C m(-2) year(-1), primarily controlled by the
   application of sawdust mulch. Both soil temperature and soil moisture
   were important environmental factors controlling GHG emissions, which
   has implications for future feedback cycles and climate change. Our
   results suggest that agricultural management strategies can be targeted
   for GHG mitigation.},

   Transportation Activities and Policy Implications},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The demand for marine transportation and its associated CO2 emissions
   are growing rapidly as a result of increasing international trade and
   economic growth. An activity-based approach is developed for forecasting
   CO2 emissions from the China-oriented international seaborne trade
   sector. To accurately estimate the aggregated emissions, CO2 emissions
   are calculated individually for five categories of vessels: crude oil
   tanker, product tanker, chemical tanker, bulk carrier, and container. A
   business-as-usual (BAU) scenario was developed to describe the current
   situation without additional mitigation policies, whilst three
   alternative scenarios were developed to describe scenarios with various
   accelerated improvements of the key factors. The aggregated CO2
   emissions are predicted to reach 419.97 Mt under the BAU scenario, and
   258.47 Mt under the optimal case, AD3. These predictions are 4.5 times
   and 2.8 times that of the aggregated emissions in 2007. Our analysis
   suggests that regulations for monitoring, reporting, and verifying the
   activities of vessels should be proposed, in order to quantify the CO2
   emissions of marine transportation activities in Chinese territorial
   waters. In the long-term future, mitigation policies should be employed
   to reduce CO2 emissions from the marine trade sector and to address the
   climatic impact of shipping.},

Title = {Managing the risks of missing international climate targets},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Abstract = {The Paris targets are based on assumptions that a global temperature
   increase of 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C above preindustrial levels will be
   safe, and that the climate can be stabilized at these higher
   temperatures. However, global average temperatures are already
   measurably impacting the Earth's systems at 1.2 degrees C above
   preindustrial levels. Many human and environmental systems cannot adapt
   to higher temperatures, which may exceed critical tipping points in
   physical climate and ecological systems.
   Compounding these risks is the likelihood that the international 2
   degrees C limit will be overshot due to political obstacles and systemic
   inertia from existing greenhouse gases, warming oceans, and the decades
   required to replace existing infrastructure. Moreover, the Earth energy
   imbalance may have to be reduced to approximately zero to stabilize the
   global climate (i.e., CO2 concentrations lowered to around 350 ppm.)
   Most IPCC mitigation scenarios assume that climate targets will be
   temporarily overshot, and require large-scale carbon dioxide removal
   {[}CDR] to subsequently lower temperatures. However, many CDR methods
   may not be politically and/or technologically feasible, and they will
   act too slowly to prevent dangerous overshoot.
   These issues raise serious doubts about the ability of current
   mitigation polices to ensure safe outcomes. They also indicate the need
   to investigate whether rapid climate cooling measures may be required to
   reduce the risks associated with high temperatures during the long time
   it will take to decarbonize the global economy and stabilize the
   climate.
   Given the uncertainty of future mitigation success, and the potentially
   existential costs of failure, there is now an urgent need to examine
   whether or not current efforts are credible, and if not, what mitigation
   measures will be required to prevent dangerous overshoot and ensure a
   safe, stable climate.
   In order to develop a feasible mitigation strategy, it will be necessary
   to prioritize research both on climate overshoot risks, and on the
   relative effectiveness, risks, costs and timelines of potential
   mitigation and adaptation approaches. Since large scale climate
   interventions will be needed to prevent dangerous global warming, all
   plausible options need to be investigated, including carbon dioxide
   removal methods and technologies for rapidly cooling global
   temperatures. This research is a prerequisite for evaluating the
   comparative benefits, costs and risks of using, or not using, various
   forms of mitigation and adaptation, and then developing a realistic
   overshoot risk management plan.},

   southern and eastern Asia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The adequacy of freshwater resources remains a critical challenge for a
   sustainable and growing society. We present a self-consistent risk-based
   assessment of water availability and use under future climate change and
   socioeconomic growth by midcentury across southern and eastern Asia
   (SEA). We employ large ensemble scenarios from an integrated modeling
   framework that are consistent across the spectrum of regional climate,
   population, and economic projections. We find socioeconomic growth
   contributes to an increase in water stress across the entire ensemble.
   However, climate change drives the ensemble central tendency toward an
   increase in water stress in China but a reduction in India, with a
   considerable spread across the ensemble. Nevertheless, the most
   deleterious unabated climate-change impact is a low probability but
   salient extreme increase in water stress over China and India. In these
   outcomes, annual withdrawals will routinely exceed water-storage
   capacity. A modest greenhouse gas mitigation pathway eliminates the
   likelihood of these extreme outcomes and also benefits hundreds of
   millions of people at risk to various levels of water stress increase.
   Over SEA we estimate an additional 200 million people under threat of
   facing at least heavily water-stressed conditions from climate change
   and socioeconomic growth, but the mitigation scenario reduces the
   additional population-under-threat by 30\% (60 million). Nevertheless,
   there remains a 1-in-2 chance that 100 million people across SEA
   experience a 50\% increase in water stress and a 1-in-10 chance they
   experience a doubling of water stress. Therefore, widespread adaptive
   measures may be required over the coming decades to meet these
   unavoidable risks in water shortfalls.},

Abstract = {Emissions of black carbon (BC) particles from anthropogenic and natural
   sources contribute to climate change and human health impacts.
   Therefore, they need to be accurately quantified to develop an effective
   mitigation strategy. Although the spread of the emission flux estimates
   for China have recently narrowed under the constraints of atmospheric
   observations, consensus has not been reached regarding the dominant
   emission sector. Here, we quantified the contribution of the residential
   sector, as 64\% (44-82\%) in 2019, using the response of the observed
   atmospheric concentration in the outflowing air during Feb-Mar 2020,
   with the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic and restricted human
   activities over China. In detail, the BC emission fluxes, estimated
   after removing effects from meteorological variability, dropped only
   slightly (- 18\%) during Feb-Mar 2020 from the levels in the previous
   year for selected air masses of Chinese origin, suggesting the
   contributions from the transport and industry sectors (36\%) were
   smaller than the rest from the residential sector (64\%). Carbon
   monoxide (CO) behaved differently, with larger emission reductions (-
   35\%) in the period Feb-Mar 2020, suggesting dominance of
   non-residential (i.e., transport and industry) sectors, which
   contributed 70\% (48-100\%) emission during 2019. The estimated BC/CO
   emission ratio for these sectors will help to further constrain
   bottom-up emission inventories. We comprehensively provide a clear
   scientific evidence supporting mitigation policies targeting reduction
   in residential BC emissions from China by demonstrating the economic
   feasibility using marginal abatement cost curves.},

Title = {Is urbanisation also the culprit of climate change? - Evidence from
   Australian cities},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this study, daily maximum and minimum air temperature (T-max and
   T-min), evaporation and rainfall data (1960-2011 period) were analysed
   for three Australian metropolitan cities, viz., Sydney, Melbourne and
   Brisbane, to understand whether urbanisation has influenced temperature,
   evaporation and rainfall in these cities and thus had an influence on
   the longer-term local climate variability. A total of nine key locations
   in each city were considered and one location in each city was a
   control. A modified segmented regression analysis was employed to
   understand the overall climate change and linear regression analysis to
   evaluate the impacts of urbanisation.
   The study indicates a significant overall climate change during the
   1986-2011 period when compared with the 1960-1985 periods, and
   urbanisation added to the overall climate change. There were
   statistically significant increases in T-max and T-min for Sydney and
   decreases for Melbourne, decrease in T-max and increase in T-min for
   Brisbane. On the other hand, evaporation values decreased for Sydney and
   Brisbane but increased for Melbourne. There was a statistically
   significant increase in rainfall for Brisbane only. The study suggests
   that climate change adaptation strategies and policies need to consider
   urbanisation, alongwith greenhouse gases, to cope with future climate
   change scenarios.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Abstract = {For the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China, little attention has
   been given to CH4 emissions and related emission mitigation. This paper
   presents a detailed bottom-up estimation and comparison analysis of
   China's CH4 and CO2 emissions for the first time. China's CH4 emissions
   are shown with comparable importance to the CO2 emissions at the
   national and regional levels. The national total CH4 emission in 2008
   amounts to 39 Tg, equivalent to about 1/8, 1/3 and 3/5 of the total CO2
   emission by the 100-year global warming potential (GWP) factor, the
   20-year GWP factor and the global thermodynamic potential factor,
   respectively. Increasing CH4 emissions could compromise China's efforts
   to mitigate its GHG emissions. In contrast to energy-dominated emission
   pattern for CO2, the major sources of China's CH4 emissions are coal
   mining, enteric fermentation, rice cultivation and waste management.
   Meanwhile, there exists a large gap between the eastern coastal regions
   and the western and central inland regions in the emission magnitude and
   emission intensity for CH4 and CO2, with different mitigation
   flexibilities. Reducing CH4 emissions should be integrated into the
   national and regional policies for GHG emission mitigation. In some
   central and western regions such as Shanxi, Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou,
   Qinghai and Tibet, the inclusion of CH4 emission intensity reduction can
   be more cost-effective than only setting a target for CO2 emission
   intensity to reduce the regional GHG emission intensity. (C) 2014

Title = {Dangerous climate change and the importance of adaptation for the
   Arctic's Inuit population},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The Arctic's climate is changing rapidly, to the extent that `dangerous'
   climate change as defined by the United Nations Framework on Climate
   Change might already be occurring. These changes are having implications
   for the Arctic's Inuit population and are being exacerbated by the
   dependence of Inuit on biophysical resources for livelihoods and the low
   socio-economic-health status of many northern communities. Given the
   nature of current climate change and projections of a rapidly warming
   Arctic, climate policy assumes a particular importance for Inuit
   regions. This paper argues that efforts to stabilize and reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions are urgent if we are to avoid runaway climate
   change in the Arctic, but unlikely to prevent changes which will be
   dangerous for Inuit. In this context, a new policy discourse on climate
   change is required for Arctic regions-one that focuses on adaptation.
   The paper demonstrates that states with Inuit populations and the
   international community in general has obligations to assist Inuit to
   adapt to climate change through international human rights and climate
   change treaties. However, the adaptation deficit, in terms of what we
   know and what we need to know to facilitate successful adaptation, is
   particularly large in an Arctic context and limiting the ability to
   develop response options. Moreover, adaptation as an option of response
   to climate change is still marginal in policy negotiations and Inuit
   political actors have been slow to argue the need for adaptation
   assistance. A new focus on adaptation in both policy negotiations and
   scientific research is needed to enhance Inuit resilience and reduce
   vulnerability in a rapidly changing climate.},

Title = {How climate compatible are livelihood adaptation strategies and
   development programs in rural Indonesia?},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {100-114},
Abstract = {Achieving climate compatible development (CCD) is a necessity in
   developing countries, but there are few examples of requisite planning
   processes, or manifestations of CCD. This paper presents a
   multi-stakeholder, participatory planning process designed to screen and
   prioritise rural livelihood adaptation strategies against nine CCD
   criteria. The process also integrated three principles of adaptation
   pathways: interventions should be (1) `no regrets' and maintain
   reversibility to avoid mal-adaptation; (2) address both proximate and
   underlying systemic drivers of community vulnerability; and (3) linked
   across spatial scales and jurisdictional levels to promote coordination.
   Using examples of two rural sub-districts in Indonesia, we demonstrate
   the process and resulting CCD strategies. Priority strategies varied
   between the sub-districts but all reflected standard development
   interventions: water management, intensification or diversification of
   agriculture and aquaculture, education, health, food security and
   skills-building for communities. Strategies delivered co-benefits for
   human development and ecosystem services and hence adaptive capacity,
   but greenhouse mitigation co-benefits were less significant. Actions to
   deliver the strategies' objectives were screened for reversibility, and
   a minority were potentially maladaptive (i.e. path dependent,
   disproportionately burdening the most vulnerable, reducing incentives to
   adapt, or increasing greenhouse gas emissions) yet highly feasible.
   These related to infrastructure, which paradoxically is necessary to
   deliver `soft' adaptation benefits (i.e. road access to health
   services). Only a small minority of transformative strategies addressed
   the systemic (i.e. institutional and political) drivers of
   vulnerability. Strategies were well-matched by development programs,
   suggesting that current interventions mirror CCD. However, development
   programs tackled fewer systemic drivers, were poorly coordinated and had
   a higher risk of mal-adaptation. We conclude that the approach is
   effective for screening and prioritising no regrets CCD, but more
   extensive learning processes are necessary to build decision-makers'
   capacity to tackle systemic drivers, and to scrutinise potentially
   mal-adaptive infrastructural investments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation are
   connected through a common goal: reducing the impacts of extreme events
   and increasing resilience to disasters, particularly among vulnerable
   populations. By coordinating adaptation and disaster risk management
   policies, multiple benefits can be achieved. Ecosystem-based adaptation
   (EbA) offers a cost-effective adaptation and DRR at different scales and
   under multiple scenarios. EbA uses natural or managed ecosystem
   processes to increase resilience and adaptation to climate change. EbA
   delivers other benefits, including mitigating greenhouse gases, and
   improving biodiversity, water and air quality. These co-benefits can be
   the primary driver for implementation and reflect related policy
   objectives. EbA are also associated with different land use or habitat
   types (e.g. agriculture, forestry, coastal, urban, or freshwater
   ecosystems).
   This paper considers the lessons learnt from implementing EbA across a
   range of land uses. However, implementation frequently applies multiple
   measures across land uses and at varying scales. The evidence indicates
   that adaptation and DRR are achievable cost-effectively whilst providing
   important co-benefits. Demonstrating these co-benefits ensures both
   stakeholder support and funding opportunities. Further, the
   mainstreaming of nature-based solutions across policy areas linked to
   different co-benefits both increases the acceptability of EbA and also
   opens up multiple funding sources. Key to the success of EbA is the
   involvement of stakeholders throughout the implementation process; this
   can include demonstrating private benefits and utilising trusted
   intermediaries. However, gaps often remain in our knowledge of the
   biophysical and economic benefits, or negative impacts, of EbA
   indicating that research and monitoring remain a priority.},

Title = {Towards adaptive coastal management: Lessons from a ``legal storm{''} in
   Byron Shire, Australia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {179},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Adaptive management has been advocated as an appropriate approach for
   the management of social-ecological systems, although its implementation
   has proven to be a challenge. Legal systems can hinder or facilitate
   adaptive management. Focusing on legal arrangements, this article
   explores how adaptive management can be better operationalised in the
   context of coastal management. Byron Shire, a local government area in
   New South Wales, Australia, was selected as a case study where we: (a)
   analysed how the concept of adaptive management has emerged within the
   evolution of coastal management and its applicable legal framework, and
   (b) identified juridical constraints to adaptive coastal management.
   Qualitative methods were used for the analysis of relevant documents and
   semi-structured interviews with 23 key informants. The results show that
   a distorted version of adaptive management has been adopted in Byron
   Shire's draft coastal management plans, which fails to adhere to the
   formal, structured, and iterative process of adaptive management. A
   legacy created by the legal effects of past decisions affecting coastal
   management has led to a path dependency towards protective measures to
   manage coastal erosion, constraining other management options,
   particularly managed realignment strategies. Failure to address
   juridical constraints in the early stages of the adaptive management
   process can result in stakeholder conflict and litigation.
   Overlitigation harms adaptive coastal management by pushing the
   decision-making process away from the pathway offered by the legal
   framework for preparing and implementing coastal management plans. After
   recent legislative coastal reform at the state level, there is momentum
   for the Byron Shire Council to refocus its adaptive management approach.
   However, overcoming existing juridical constraints will require adaptive
   governance, in which all levels of government must work collaboratively
   with the affected stakeholders in the design and implementation of the
   adaptive management process.},

Abstract = {We adapted an integrated model, RESPONSE, to assess the cost-optimized
   timing of oceanic, geological, and biological carbon sequestration
   versus fossil emission reduction to mitigate climate change in a context
   of uncertainty and learning about the magnitude of climate sensitivity
   to greenhouse-gas forcing. We find that the replacement of abatement
   measures in the energy sector by various sequestration measures can cut
   total mitigation policy costs by up to 35\% for the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change (WMO and UNEP) A1B and A2 emissions scenarios.
   Biological carbon sequestration and carbon capture and geological or
   oceanic storage (CCS) contribute to relaxing carbon constraints on the
   energy sector while adapting to the level of climatic uncertainties.
   Afforestation, the most flexible option, is helpful in the short run to
   prevent excessively fast warming, while CCS in geologic or oceanic
   reservoirs is useful primarily in the longer run to mitigate against
   overshooting a desired temperature ceiling. In cases of leaky storage,
   CCS may be less appropriate than emission reduction to stabilize
   climate, especially if high reference emissions and/or high climate
   sensitivity are expected. Worst-case scenarios of high emissions and
   climate sensitivity might preclude to a certain extent the use of carbon
   sequestration as a substitute for fossil energy reductions. Therefore,
   the design of optimal sequestration policies depends critically on the
   anticipation of (1) long-term emission trends and (2) the effective
   value of the climate sensitivity.},

Abstract = {In this study we produce two urban development scenarios estimating
   potential urban sprawl and optimized development concerning building
   construction, and we simulate their inf uence on air temperature,
   surface temperatures and human thermal comfort. We select two heat waves
   representative for present and future conditions of the mid 21st century
   and simulations are run with the Town Energy Balance Model (TEB) coupled
   online and offlin to the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF).
   Global and regional climate change under the RCP8.5 scenario causes an
   increase of daily maximum air temperature in Vienna by 7 K. The daily
   minimum air temperature will increase by 2-4 K. Changes caused by urban
   growth or densificati n mainly affect air temperature and human thermal
   comfort locally where new urbanisation takes place and does not occur
   significa tly in the central districts. A combination of near
   zero-energy standards and increasing albedo of building materials on the
   city scale accomplishes a maximum reduction of urban canyon temperature
   achieved by changes in urban parameters of 0.9 K for the minima and 0.2
   K for the maxima. Local scale changes of different adaptation measures
   show that insulation of buildings alone increases the maximum wall
   surface temperatures by more than 10 K or the maximum mean radiant
   temperature (MRT) in the canyon by 5 K. Therefore, measures to reduce
   MRT within the urban canyons like tree shade are needed to complement
   the proposed measures. This study concludes that the rising air
   temperatures expected by climate change puts an unprecedented heat
   burden on Viennese inhabitants, which cannot easily be reduced by
   measures concerning buildings within the city itself. Additionally,
   measures such as planting trees to provide shade, regional water
   sensitive planning and global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in
   order to reduce temperature extremes are required.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent hydro-meteorological disasters have sparked popular interest in
   climate change and its role in driving these events. In this paper, we
   focus on the information provided by one such type of disaster,
   hurricanes, to capital markets. Because carbon dioxide emissions from
   the combustion of fossil fuels are the primary contributor to greenhouse
   gas concentrations, and their reduction is key to any climate change
   mitigation strategy, we focus on energy companies. We estimate the
   reaction of the stock market returns of the largest energy companies in
   the United States to the most notorious, economically damaging
   hurricanes in the North Atlantic Ocean in each of the last four decades
   prior to the Paris Agreement: Hugo (1989), Andrew (1992), Katrina
   (2005), and Sandy (2012). The event study analysis shows that the
   impacts are not large, but they are significantly different from zero.
   Further regression analysis shows that the impacts differ across energy
   companies based on their carbon intensity; firms with cleaner fuel mixes
   experienced positive cumulative excess returns relative to coal, and the
   difference is the largest and most persistent for renewable stocks.},

Volume = {113},

Abstract = {Legislation to decarbonise energy systems within overall greenhouse gas
   reduction targets represents an immense and unprecedented energy policy
   challenge. However there is a dichotomy between this level of policy
   ambition and prior modelling studies that find such targets
   economically, technologically and socially feasible under idealised
   aEuro center dot first-best policies. This paper makes a significant
   contribution to current analytical efforts to account for realistic
   aEuro center dot second-best climate mitigation policy implementation.
   This is achieved via a technical classification of secondbest common
   mode issues at a detailed national level: both internal (behavioural
   change, infrastructure implementation) and external (new technologies,
   resource availability). Under a combinatory second-best scenario,
   meeting targets greater than a 70\% reduction in CO2 by 2050 entail
   costs above a subjective barrier of 1\% of GDP, while extreme mitigation
   scenarios (> 90\% CO2 reduction) are infeasible. These high costs are
   equally due to disappointing progress in behavioural and technological
   mitigation efforts. Expensive second-best mitigation scenarios can still
   rely on extreme assumptions including the full deployment of the UK's
   offshore wind resource or the complete diffusion of energy efficiency
   measures in end-use sectors. By demonstrating the fragilities of a low
   carbon energy system pathway, policy makers can explore protective and
   proactive strategies to ensure targets can actually be met.
   Additionally, systematic analysis of failure in stringent long term
   decarbonisation scenarios teaches energy analysts about the trade-offs
   in model efficacy vs. confidence.},

Title = {A climate goal-based, multicriteria method for system evaluation in life

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1913-1931},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Purpose Our ability to restrict global warming to the established
   objectives in the Paris Agreement depends on the metrics used to
   evaluate the climate change impact. Stemmed on the criticism of the
   current GWP metrics used with life cycle assessment (LCA), this study
   proposes new indicators and an interpretation grid for climate change
   impact in LCA, which are adaptive to present, short-term, and long-term
   climate goals. Methods The global mean temperature change (GMTC) is used
   in the indicators' definition and time parameters are introduced for a
   multicriteria evaluation of climate change impact. We adopt
   calendar-related time targets instead of a fixed time horizon. The
   systems are analyzed on a real-time scale and with respect to a
   climate-target point in time (for example, 2050 as objective for climate
   neutrality), in contrast with conventional LCA. The objective is to
   provide flexibility in system evaluation, adaptable to current and
   future targets. Results and discussion Four indicators are introduced:
   (1) the amplitude of the temperature change (GMTC(max)), representative
   for climate extreme events; (2) the time at which GMTC starts to
   definitely decrease and its distance with respect to the goal
   (t(last\_peak)); (3) the time climate neutrality is reached and its
   distance with respect to the goal (t(neutral)); and (4) the accumulated
   warming until a targeted time, representative for sea-level rise and ice
   melting (integrated GMTC at a given time target, for example at the end
   of century iGMTC(2100)). An analysis grid is proposed based on these
   indicators and illustrated on 26 emission profiles involving long- and
   short-lived greenhouse gases with various temporalities, as well as on
   two dynamic LCA case studies. In the group of neutral systems,
   temporality is responsible for variations in GMTC(max) and iGMTC(2100).
   Increasing the frequency of emission/capture events flattens both
   indicators and provides the best performance. Equal CO2 emission systems
   are discriminated primarily by t(last\_peak), while in the case of
   methane, more relief is observed for all indicators. The method allows
   for the design of tailored mitigation solutions in LCA application
   examples. Conclusions The indicators are able to discriminate and rank
   systems that are considered to be non-impacting, equivalently impacting,
   or neutral in LCA-GWP metrics. Such metrics is necessary to correctly
   (avoid strong simplifications) and unambiguously (with unaltered
   physical parameters, closer to climate physics) evaluate the effect on
   climate, mitigation solutions, neutrality, and support decision-making.},

Title = {Adaptive coping strategies towards seasonal change impacts: Indonesian
   small-scale fisherman household},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Small-scale fishers are always expected to adapt to fishing activities
   that cannot be conducted all year round due to weather and fishing
   season. This condition, especially when it is not the fish season, makes
   fishers face a problem. Notwithstanding, fishermen households need to
   develop an adequate adaptation strategy to solve the problem of
   fulfilling their needs, known as coping strategies. This study aims to
   analyze fishermen households' coping strategies in facing the fishing
   season and non-fish season by using fishermen's family resources and two
   types of internal and external family coping strategies. The data were
   gathered from approximately 150 smallscale fishing households using
   simple random sampling. The results indicate the fishers do fishing
   activities in three batch: peak season (68\%), mild season (20\%), and
   off-season (12\%). The use of resources for fishermen households' coping
   strategy is carried out by diversifying the sources of household income.
   Some economic activities include cultivating forest land belonging to
   the forest department, marine tour guides, livestock, and his wife. This
   study also confirm that all households use internal family coping
   strategies with humor indicator as the highest percentage. Accordingly,
   the households also adopt the external family coping strategy to deal
   with the existing situation. This strategy follows the local community's
   characteristics and culture who are friendly and open and based on
   religion. The household coping strategy strengthening model is generated
   through the synergy of formal institutional roles in society and
   government institutions as policymakers.},

Title = {Geospatial Simulation Model of Sustainable Mangrove Development
   Scenarios for the Years 2030 and 2050 in Marismas Nacionales, Mexico},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities influence the loss of mangroves, increase
   natural phenomena such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and El Nino, and
   consequently increase concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO2,
   promoting climate change. There are strategies to reduce emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation, the Sustainable Development Goals,
   and the General Law on Climate Change to counteract these conditions.
   Therefore, this research aims to generate an integral simulation model
   of sustainable mangrove development scenarios for 2030 and 2050 through
   mitigation strategies, using geospatial techniques, multi-criteria
   evaluation, and generating a future surface demand model. The Marismas
   Nacionales study area is a mangrove ecosystem and an important carbon
   sink. The simulation model determined that the mangrove area in 2030
   will be 77,555 hectares, with an estimated absorption of 358.95 Gg CO2 e
   (equivalent). By 2050 there will be 86,476 ha, absorbing 400.24 Gg CO2
   e. This increase will be in disturbed mangrove areas and other wetlands.
   The sustainable simulation model and the surface demand model can be
   applied in any study area to increase, protect, and conserve mangroves
   to benefit the social, economic, and environmental sectors.},

Abstract = {Environmental impacts of concentrate management from desalination
   projects is a major consideration in deciding for an appropriate
   concentrate management strategy and mitigation methods. The concentrate
   management technology of each plant should be developed in view of the
   desalination plant location, potential environmental impacts, and
   possible mitigation options. This paper examines the advantages and
   disadvantages of different concentrate management strategies in view of
   the characteristics of the concentrates from desalination processes and
   potential environmental impacts for each concentrate management
   alterative. The quality of the concentrate depends on the amount of
   chemicals used (i.e., anti-scaling agents, surfactants, acids for pH
   adjustment, and salts removed from feed water). Therefore, concentrate
   produced by the desalination processes can impact the land, marine
   environment, energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater
   quality as well as demands for chemicals, and noise emissions. The aim
   of this study is to develop an assessment method by analyzing the
   potential impacts in view of the criteria associated with each
   alternative. The general concentrate management options include
   discharge to oceans and bays, discharge to surface waters and sanitary
   sewers, deep well injection, land disposal, and evaporation ponds. In
   view of the potent toxicity and persistence of emerging contaminants,
   innovative and cost-effective treatment technologies are needed,
   especially for the emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) that may be
   retained in the concentrate. The results of this study can be used as a
   decision making tool for preliminary screening of options for
   concentrate management strategies appropriate depending on the location
   of the desalination plants.},

Abstract = {Avoiding the most serious climate change impacts will require informed
   policy decisions. This in turn will require information regarding the
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions required to stabilize climate in a
   state not too much warmer than today. A new low emission scenario is
   simulated in a global climate model to show how some of the impacts from
   climate change can be averted through mitigation. Compared to a
   non-intervention reference scenario, emission reductions of about 70\%
   by 2100 are required to prevent roughly half the change in temperature
   and precipitation that would otherwise occur. By 2100, the resulting
   stabilized global climate would ensure preservation of considerable
   Arctic sea ice and permafrost areas. Future heat waves would be 55\%
   less intense, and sea level rise from thermal expansion would be about
   57\% lower than if a non-mitigation scenario was followed. Citation:

Abstract = {Climate Change has emerged as one of the grand global challenges facing
   humanity. The dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas that seems to be
   contributing to the climate change problem, carbon dioxide (COD, has a
   complex cycle through the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. The
   combustion of fossil fuels (power production, transportation, etc.)
   remains the largest source of anthropogenic CO2 to the Earth's
   atmosphere. Up until very recently, the quantification of fossil fuel
   CO2 was understood only at coarse space and time scales. A recent
   research effort has greatly improved this space/time quantification
   resulting in source data at a resolution of less than 10 km(2)/hr at the
   surface of North America. By providing visual tools to examine this new,
   high resolution CO2 data, we can better understand the way that CO2 is
   transmitted within the atmosphere and how it is exchanged with other
   components of the Earth System. We have developed interactive visual
   analytic tools, which allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and
   extraction. The Visualization system is aimed for a wide range Of users
   which include researchers and political leaders. The goal is to help
   assist these people in analyzing data and enabling new policy options in
   mitigation of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the U.S.},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {With the introduction of plug-in vehicles (PEVs) into the light-duty
   vehicle fleet, the tail-pipe emissions of GHGs and criteria pollutants
   will be partly transferred to electricity generating units. To study the
   impact of PEVs on well-to-wheels emissions, the U.S. Western electrical
   grid serving the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California is modeled
   with both spatial and temporal resolution at the level of individual
   power plants. Electricity load is calculated and projected for future
   years, and the temporal electricity generation of each power plant
   within the SoCAB is modeled based on historical data and knowledge of
   electricity generation and dispatch.
   Due to the efficiency and pollutant controls governing the performance
   of the Western grid, the deployment of PEVs results in a daily reduction
   of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and tail-pipe emissions, especially in the
   critical morning and afternoon commute hours. The extent of improvement
   depends on charging scenarios, future grid mix, and the number and type
   of plug-in vehicles. In addition, charging PEVs using wind energy that
   would otherwise be curtailed can result in a substantial emissions
   reduction. Smart control will be required to manage PEV charging in
   order to mitigate renewable intermittencies and decrease emissions
   associated with peaking power production. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Towards adaptive coastal management law: Lessons from Australia and
   Brazil},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {219},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Although adaptive management has been advocated for dealing with the
   complexity and dynamics of social ecological systems for more than 40
   years, successful outcomes in practice have been limited. Among the
   efforts to overcome this implementation gap, there has been a growing
   interest in understanding the role of law in adaptive management. In
   this article, we provide an analysis of adaptive management in two
   jurisdictions struggling with coastal erosion in the context of their
   legal arrangements for coastal management: (i) Byron Shire, a local
   government area in the State of New South Wales, Australia; and (ii)
   Florian acute accent opolis, a municipality in the State of Santa
   Catarina, Brazil. Methods included document analysis and inductive
   thematic coding of 50 semi-structured interviews with key informants
   from four different stakeholder groups. Our results indicate that both
   legal certainty and legal flexibility are relevant for adaptive
   management success. Three directions towards coupling adaptive coastal
   management with law are suggested: (i) to incorporate adaptive
   management into coastal management legislation; (ii) to address legal
   path dependencies that cause maladaptation; and (iii) to integrate
   adaptive coastal management and adaptive coastal governance through
   adaptive coastal management law. Our suggestions contribute to improved
   knowledge on adaptive coastal management law by emphasising the need for
   an optimal balance between legal flexibility and legal certainty, which
   represents an avenue for further research and policy development beyond
   the jurisdictions analysed.},

   relative to pre-industrial levels. The more recent Paris climate
   agreement has a more ambitious target of limiting the temperature rise
   to well below 2 degrees C and the EU ambition is growing to become
   climate-neutral by 2050. This research explores decarbonization options
   using an innovative analytical approach that combines energy systems
   analysis and marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs). System-wide MACCs
   are derived using scenario ensembles from Irish TIMES energy systems
   model. Decomposition analysis is then used to associate decarbonization
   options with carbon abatement costs. In addition, energy systems
   analysis is carried out on the underlying scenario ensembles that are
   used to generate the MACCs to capture more technological details and to
   reflect interactions among technologies. The results show that MACCs are
   highly dependent on model assumptions and the availabilities of
   bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies play
   critical roles. The paper also shows how key mitigation measures can be
   ranked and classified into categories of resilient (wind energy, CCS,
   electric vehicles, biofuels), tipping-point (electrifying building
   heating, biomass plants), and niche (ocean energy) technologies.},

Title = {Exploring Potential Inequities Between Burdens and Benefits of Climate
   Change Abatement Policies},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2010},
Number = {2163},
Pages = {65-72},
Abstract = {Although the connection between the storms along the coast of the Gulf
   of Mexico in 2005 and global climate change is still being debated, the
   fact that low-income communities are more likely to bear the greatest
   burden and are more vulnerable to potential future climate change and
   rising sea levels is widely acknowledged. Adding to this problem,
   greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming are income
   dependent: people with the highest incomes, both globally and within
   specific communities, tend to pollute more than those with the lowest
   incomes. A policy dilemma thus arises when abatement strategies involve
   regressive financing or when the benefits of such strategies are
   concentrated within higher-income groups. Low-income communities are in
   effect subsidizing the pollution abatement of higher-income communities.
   This paper reviews a range of evidence showing the unequal
   vulnerabilities, responsibilities, benefits, and costs from climate
   change and climate change policies. A framework for the evaluation of
   climate change mitigation strategies in the transportation sector is
   then proposed. This framework incorporates these equity issues along
   with other traditional measures of policy effectiveness. Exactly how
   these various inequities are incorporated and valued is highly case
   specific and is proposed as the subject of future research.},

Title = {Negligible Warming Caused by Nord Stream Methane Leaks},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES},
Abstract = {Unanticipated sabotage of two underwater pipelines in the Baltic Sea
   (Nord Stream 1 and 2) happened on 26 September 2022. Massive quantities
   of natural gas, primarily methane, were released into the atmosphere,
   which lasted for about one week. As a more powerful greenhouse gas than
   CO2, the potential climatic impact of methane is a global concern. Using
   multiple methods and datasets, a recent study reported a relatively
   accurate magnitude of the leaked methane at 0.22 +/- 0.03 million tons
   (Mt), which was lower than the initial estimate in the immediate
   aftermath of the event. Under an energy conservation framework used in
   IPCC AR6, we derived a negligible increase in global surface air
   temperature of 1.8 x 10(-5) degrees C in a 20-year time horizon caused
   by the methane leaks with an upper limit of 0.25 Mt. Although the
   resultant warming from this methane leak incident was minor, future
   carbon release from additional Earth system feedbacks, such as thawing
   permafrost, and its impact on the methane mitigation pathways of the
   Paris Agreement, warrants investigation.},

   plantations},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {We explored the climate impacts for two land-use change scenarios, aimed
   at mitigating the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using
   the integrated assessment model IMAGE 2.2, we found that the large-scale
   implementation in the extratropics of either carbon-sequestration or
   modern-biomass plantations decreases the CO2 concentration with 70-80
   ppmv by the year 2100 compared to a nonmitigation baseline. In a coupled
   land/atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice model this moderates global warming over
   the 21st century by 10\%. However, the carbon-sequestration option
   raises the absorption of solar radiation due to a lower albedo compared
   to the scenario involving modern-biomass plantations (for biofuels
   production). The albedo-induced difference in global mean temperature is
   as large as the mitigation by CO2 changes in the two scenarios compared
   to the baseline. Further, an atmospheric circulation change in the
   carbon-plantation scenario weakens the supply of moisture from the
   oceans to North Africa and central Eurasia. In our model this decreases
   annual mean precipitation over North Africa by up to 10\% and further
   increases summer temperatures over Eurasia. These findings lead us to
   conclude that other climate impacts than just CO2 changes have to be
   taken into account when discussing climate-change mitigation options
   that involve land-use changes.},

Abstract = {Seagrass meadows provide multiple ecosystem services, yet they are among
   the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Because of their role as carbon
   sinks, protection and restoration of seagrass meadows contribute to
   climate change mitigation. Blue Carbon strategies aim to enhance CO2
   sequestration and avoid greenhouse gasses emissions through the
   management of coastal vegetated ecosystems, including seagrass meadows.
   The implementation of Blue Carbon strategies requires a good
   understanding of the habitat characteristics that influence C-org
   sequestration. Here, we review the existing knowledge on Blue Carbon
   research in seagrass meadows to identify the key habitat characteristics
   that influence C-org sequestration in seagrass meadows, those factors
   that threaten this function and those with unclear effects. We
   demonstrate that not all seagrass habitats have the same potential,
   identify research priorities and describe the implications of the
   results found for the implementation and development of efficient Blue
   Carbon strategies based on seagrass meadows.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will disproportionately affect equatorial
   regions and closely adjacent areas, referred to here as the Fateful
   Ellipse. The vulnerability of these regions is exacerbated by a lack of
   capital for adaptive measures against the impacts of climate change. The
   increasing transference of capital from governmental control to private
   hands, and the increasing concentration of such capital into the hands
   of fewer individuals raises further concerns about capacity to mitigate
   or adapt to climate change. In addition, conflicts arise regarding the
   choice of climate change solutions. Ironically, the people of the
   Fateful Ellipse, who are most vulnerable to climate change, produce the
   lowest amount of carbon per capita. As a result of the colonial
   enterprise, including slavery, they also paid a heavy price toward the
   economic ascendency of Europe and North America and the Industrial
   Revolution that fueled the rise in greenhouse gas production. The
   discipline of geography itself owes some measure of its development and
   ascendency to colonialism and the exploitation of the Fateful Ellipse.
   As geographers we have the capacity, and a special responsibility, to
   contribute to the development of climate change solutions and global
   environmental justice.},

Title = {Adaptation to Climate Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {76},
Number = {4},
Pages = {477-495},
Abstract = {Problem: Even if significant reductions in global greenhouse gas
   emissions are achieved, some amount of climate change appears to be
   inevitable. Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation
   should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This
   article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using
   California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory
   challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly
   vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air
   quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to
   adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest
   how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents
   a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent
   research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize
   the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative
   information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review.
   Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate
   data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and
   increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and
   wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure
   investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate
   change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development,
   habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency
   coordination and new laws and regulations. Takeaway for practice: Local
   and regional planners can help society adapt to a changing climate by
   using the best available science, deciding on goals and early actions,
   locating relevant partners, identifying and eliminating regulatory
   barriers, and encouraging the introduction of new state mandates and
   guidelines. Research support: Partial support for this research was
   provided by Pacific Gas and Electric, The Nature Conservancy, and Next

Abstract = {To understand the urban environment from a meteorological perspective in
   order to design better and more sustainable neighbourhoods, an
   open-source and low-cost meteorological device was developed and tested
   at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL). The results
   underlined, for example, strong temperature gradients on the campus,
   particularly in builtup areas with a high density of artificial
   surfaces. Additionally, the outdoor human comfort was evaluated for
   multiple locations around the campus, underlying the impact of the urban
   surfaces as well as the city interface and the greening design. Such
   studies can be seen as crucial to provide information to stakeholders in
   the evaluation of their planning strategies either for mitigation (such
   as decrease of the urban heat island effect or greenhouse gas emissions)
   or for adaptation (such as improvement of outdoor spaces to face future
   heat waves).},

Title = {Mitigation measures to contain the environmental impact of urban areas:
   a bibliographic review moving from the life cycle approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The global environmental impact of urban areas has greatly increased
   over the years, due to the growth of urbanisation and the associated
   increase in management costs. There are several measures aimed at
   mitigating this impact that affect in different ways the environmental,
   economic and societal spheres. This article has analysed a selection of
   different mitigation measures, related to the built environment,
   according to the life cycle approach, aimed at identifying the
   procedural features chosen by the different authors and defining a
   common way to deal with this issue. In particular, all the individual
   single steps of a Life Cycle Assessment/Life Cycle Costing of the
   different studies are analysed and the results of the individual
   measures are highlighted. The analysis has shown how the scientific
   literature is mainly focused on the evaluation of the impact of
   technological solutions related to individual buildings (cool/green
   roof). Less interest is shown in the solutions for urban areas, while,
   as far as the impact on greenhouse gas emissions is concerned, some
   studies are shifting the target to a global scale. Due to the accuracy
   whereby the calculation of the impact indicators deals with and
   structures the life cycle methods, opportunities to compare studies
   developed by different authors are quite rare and hard to find. Hence
   the need to find a simple, intuitive and flexible scheme to combine some
   of the most useful results of the bibliographical studies, in a
   comparative outline of different technological solutions, which can
   support the decision-making phase through a rough assessment.},

Title = {Synergies and trade-offs between climate change adaptation options and
   gender equality: a review of the global literature},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts are being felt across sectors in all regions of
   the world, and adaptation projects are being implemented to reduce
   climate risks and existing vulnerabilities. Climate adaptation actions
   also have significant synergies and tradeoffs with the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 5 on gender equality. Questions
   are increasingly being raised about the gendered and climate justice
   implications of different adaptation options. This paper investigates if
   reported climate change adaptation actions are contributing to advancing
   the goal of gender equality (SDG 5) or not. It focuses on linkages
   between individual targets of SDG 5 and climate change adaptation
   actions for nine major sectors where transformative climate actions are
   envisaged. The assessment is based on evidence of adaptation actions
   documented in 319 relevant research publications published during
   2014-2020. Positive links to nine targets under SDG 5 are found in
   adaptation actions that are consciously designed to advance gender
   equality. However, in four sectors-ocean and coastal ecosystems;
   mountain ecosystems; poverty, livelihood, sustainable development; and
   industrial system transitions, we find more negative links than positive
   links. For adaptation actions to have positive impacts on gender
   equality, gender-focused targets must be intentionally brought in at the
   prioritisation, designing, planning, and implementation stages. An SDG
   5+ approach, which takes into consideration intersectionality and gender
   aspects beyond women alone, can help adaptation actions move towards
   meeting gender equality and other climate justice goals. This reflexive
   approach is especially critical now, as we approach the mid-point in the
   timeline for achieving the SDGs.},

Title = {Total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves across broad global
   environmental and physical gradients},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mangroves sequester large quantities of carbon (C) that become
   significant sources of greenhouse gases when disturbed through land-use
   change. Thus, they are of great value to incorporate into climate change
   adaptation and mitigation strategies. In response, a global network of
   mangrove plots was established to provide policy-relevant ecological
   data relating to interactions of mangrove C stocks with climatic, tidal,
   plant community, and geomorphic factors. Mangroves from 190 sites were
   sampled across five continents encompassing large biological, physical,
   and climatic gradients using consistent methodologies for the
   quantification of total ecosystem C stocks (TECS). Carbon stock data
   were collected along with vegetation, physical, and climatic data to
   explore potential predictive relationships. There was a 28-fold range in
   TECS (79-2,208 Mg C/ha) with a mean of 856 +/- 32 Mg C/ha. Belowground C
   comprised an average 85\% of the TECS. Mean soil depth was 216 cm,
   ranging from 22 to >300 cm, with 68 sites (35\%) exceeding a depth of
   300 cm. TECS were weakly correlated with metrics of forest structure,
   suggesting that aboveground forest structure alone cannot accurately
   predict TECS. Similarly, precipitation was not a strong predictor of
   TECS. Reasonable estimates of TECS were derived via multiple regression
   analysis using precipitation, soil depth, tree mass, and latitude (R-2 =
   0.54) as variables. Soil carbon to a 1 m depth averaged 44\% of the
   TECS. Limiting analyses of soil C stocks to the top 1 m of soils result
   in large underestimates of TECS as well as in the greenhouse gas
   emissions that would arise from their conversion to other land uses. The
   current IPCC Tier 1 default TECS value for mangroves is 511 Mg C/ha,
   which is only 60\% of our calculated global mean. This study improves
   current assessments of mangrove C stocks providing a foundation
   necessary for C valuation related to climate change mitigation. We
   estimate mangroves globally store about 11.7 Pg C: an aboveground carbon
   stock of 1.6 Pg C and a belowground carbon stock of 10.2 Pg C). The
   differences in the estimates of total ecosystem carbon stocks based on
   climate, salinity, forest structure, geomorphology, or geopolitical
   boundaries are not as much of an influence as the choice of soil depth
   included in the estimate. Choosing to limit soils to a 1 m depth
   resulted in estimates of 1 m depth resulted in global carbon stock
   estimates that exceeded 11.2 Pg C.},

Title = {Limited influence of climate change mitigation on short-term glacier
   mass loss},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {305+},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Glacier mass loss is a key contributor to sea-level change(1,2), slope
   instability in high-mountain regions(3,4) and the changing seasonality
   and volume of river flow(5-7). Understanding the causes, mechanisms and
   time scales of glacier change is therefore paramount to identifying
   successful strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Here, we use
   temperature and precipitation fields from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 output to force a glacier evolution
   model, quantifying mass responses to future climatic change. We find
   that contemporary glacier mass is in disequilibrium with the current
   climate, and 36 +/- 8\% mass loss is already committed in response to
   past greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, mitigating future emissions
   will have only very limited influence on glacier mass change in the
   twenty-first century. No significant differences between 1.5 and 2 K
   warming scenarios are detectable in the sea-level contribution of
   glaciers accumulated within the twenty-first century. In the long-term,
   however, mitigation will exert strong control, suggesting that ambitious
   measures are necessary for the long-term preservation of glaciers.},

Title = {Global inequities between polluters and the polluted: climate change
   impacts on coral reefs},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3982-3994},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For many ecosystem services, it remains uncertain whether the impacts of
   climate change will be mostly negative or positive and how these changes
   will be geographically distributed. These unknowns hamper the
   identification of regional winners and losers, which can influence
   debate over climate policy. Here, we use coral reefs to explore the
   spatial variability of climate stress by modelling the ecological
   impacts of rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification, two
   important coral stressors associated with increasing greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. We then combine these results with national per capita
   emissions to quantify inequities arising from the distribution of cause
   (CO2 emissions) and effect (stress upon reefs) among coral reef
   countries. We find pollution and coral stress are spatially decoupled,
   creating substantial inequity of impacts as a function of emissions. We
   then consider the implications of such inequity for international
   climate policy. Targets for GHG reductions are likely to be tied to a
   country's emissions. Yet within a given level of GHG emissions, our
   analysis reveals that some countries experience relatively high levels
   of impact and will likely experience greater financial cost in terms of
   lost ecosystem productivity and more extensive adaptation measures. We
   suggest countries so disadvantaged be given access to international
   adaptation funds proportionate with impacts to their ecosystem. We raise
   the idea that funds could be more equitably allocated by formally
   including a metric of equity within a vulnerability framework.},

Abstract = {Seagrasses are remarkable plants that have adapted to live in a marine
   environment. They form extensive meadows found globally that bioengineer
   their local environments and preserve the coastal seascape. With the
   increasing realization of the planetary emergency that we face, there is
   growing interest in using seagrasses as a nature-based solution for
   greenhouse gas mitigation. However, seagrass sensitivity to stressors is
   acute, and in many places, the risk of loss and degradation persists. If
   the ecological state of seagrasses remains compromised, then their
   ability to contribute to nature-based solutions for the climate
   emergency and biodiversity crisis remains in doubt. We examine the major
   ecological role that seagrasses play and how rethinking their
   conservation is critical to understanding their part in fighting our
   planetary emergency.},

Title = {Climate change regional review: Poland},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Poland is a country where a climate change warming signal can be
   detected in temperature, but observed changes in other variables, and
   especially in precipitation, are complex. Temperature projections
   indicate further warming, but models do not agree as to seasonal
   distribution of changes in precipitation. This article reviews evidence
   for climate change and its impacts in Poland, in the context of
   observations and projections. It also reviews various aspects of climate
   change mitigation policy in the country whose energy supply is more
   coal-dominated than any other country. This is one reason why climate
   change mitigation efforts are modest and climate policy largely passive.
   The dramatic decline of industrial production involving a rapid decline
   in CO2 emissions during 19891992 was the crucial element of the Poland's
   position in the negotiations of international agreements. The European
   Union (EU) accession in 2004 tied Poland to EU climate policy. This
   cautious approach is largely in harmony with public attitudes. Poles are
   aware of climate change, but it is not considered as a priority issue
   and public opinion is divided about the issues of mitigation. Adaptation
   to climate change impacts in Poland is driven by the fact that observed
   impacts are not very large and there is no persuasive attribution of
   these impacts to greenhouse gas emissions. Reactive adaptation to
   climate change is preferred over anticipatory adaptation. There are
   several special care areas in Poland in terms of adaptation: the
   mountains; the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea; and the river valleys.

Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Afforestation, the conversion of croplands or marginal lands into
   forests, results in the sequestration of carbon. As a result,
   afforestation is considered one of the key climate-change mitigation
   strategies available to governments by the United Nations(1). However,
   forests are also less reflective than croplands, and the absorption of
   incoming solar radiation is greater over afforested areas. Afforestation
   can therefore result in net climate warming, particularly at high
   latitudes(2-5). Here, we use a comprehensive Earth system model to
   assess the climate-change mitigation potential of five afforestation
   scenarios, with afforestation carried out gradually over a 50-year
   period. Complete (100\%) and partial (50\%) afforestation of the area
   occupied at present by crops leads to a reduced warming of around 0.45
   and 0 : 25 degrees C respectively, during the period 2081-2100.
   Temperature benefits associated with more realistic global afforestation
   efforts, where less than 50\% of cropland is converted, are expected to
   be even smaller, indicating that afforestation is not a substitute for
   reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. We also show that warming reductions
   per unit afforested area are around three times higher in the tropics
   than in the boreal and northern temperate regions, suggesting that
   avoided deforestation and continued afforestation in the tropics are
   effective forestmanagement strategies from a climate perspective.},

Title = {Projecting coral responses to intensifying marine heatwaves under ocean
   acidification},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1753-1765},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Over this century, coral reefs will run the gauntlet of climate change,
   as marine heatwaves (MHWs) become more intense and frequent, and ocean
   acidification (OA) progresses. However, we still lack a quantitative
   assessment of how, and to what degree, OA will moderate the responses of
   corals to MHWs as they intensify throughout this century. Here, we first
   projected future MHW intensities for tropical regions under three future
   greenhouse gas emissions scenario (representative concentration
   pathways, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the near-term (2021-2040),
   mid-century (2041-2060) and late-century (2081-2100). We then combined
   these MHW intensity projections with a global data set of 1,788
   experiments to assess coral attribute performance and survival under the
   three emissions scenarios for the near-term, mid-century and
   late-century in the presence and absence of OA. Although warming and OA
   had predominately additive impacts on the coral responses, the
   contribution of OA in affecting most coral attributes was minor relative
   to the dominant role of intensifying MHWs. However, the addition of OA
   led to greater decreases in photosynthesis and survival under
   intermediate and unrestricted emissions scenario for the mid- and
   late-century than if intensifying MHWs were considered as the only
   driver. These results show that role of OA in modulating coral responses
   to intensifying MHWs depended on the focal coral attribute and extremity
   of the scenario examined. Specifically, intensifying MHWs and OA will
   cause increasing instances of coral bleaching and substantial declines
   in coral productivity, calcification and survival within the next two
   decades under the low and intermediate emissions scenario. These
   projections suggest that corals must rapidly adapt or acclimatize to
   projected ocean conditions to persist, which is far more likely under a
   low emissions scenario and with increasing efforts to manage reefs to
   enhance resilience.},

Title = {Efficiency in the design of coastal erosion adaptation strategies: An
   environmental-economic modelling approach},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {175-184},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Coastal zones host between 15\% and 40\% of the world population,
   important residential, tourism and port infrastructures, and a wide
   variety of terrestrial, aquatic and coastal ecosystems. These built and
   natural capitals, corresponding services and associated values may be
   lost due to coastal erosion. Coastal erosion adaptation strategies are
   frequently based on the adoption of adaptation measures at the local
   scale (i.e. `best practices') we argue that the factual costs, impacts
   and benefits of coastal erosion adaptation strategies are determined by
   the suit of adaptation measures at the landscape scale. Sustainable
   economic development of coastal regions requires balancing of the
   marginal costs and associated marginal benefits from coastal erosion
   adaptation strategies. In this paper, we develop and apply the Coastal
   Erosion Adaptation Strategies (CEAS) approach, a spatially explicit
   environmental-economic modelling approach that allows for the
   identification of efficient (welfare maximizing) coastal erosion
   adaptation strategies in coastal socio-ecological systems. Results for
   the case of groin systems along the Central Portuguese coast show that

Abstract = {The warming of the climate system is evident from observations of air
   and ocean temperatures as well as in melting of snow and ice and rising
   sea level. Measures are needed to reverse the trends of increased
   accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The two main
   paths to reverse this trend are: (i) reducing GHG emissions through
   cleaner energy generation and (ii) removing CO2 through carbon
   sequestration. The agricultural and forestry sectors can play a key role
   in both paths. Carbon markets will likely encourage increased carbon
   sequestration. However, the implementation of carbon-market projects for
   small farmers in least developed countries is still a major challenge.
   Even under the most optimistic scenarios of future GHG emissions
   adaptive measures are needed to address impacts of the warming due to
   past and current emissions. Integrating climate change into decision
   making is complicated by the uncertainty levels of climate scenarios. It
   is also challenged by a ``double conflict of scales{''}: (i) climate
   scenarios are available for periods much farther in the future than the
   ones typically needed for decision making and (ii) spatial scales of the
   climate scenarios (global to regional) are coarser than the ones often
   needed for actual decision making (i.e., local level). Introducing the
   issue of climate change into policy and development agendas can be
   facilitated by considering the longer-term variations as part of the
   continuum of total climate variability (seasons to decades to centuries)
   and generating information at the temporal scales that are relevant and
   applicable for particular decisions.},

Volume = {81},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As with the global scenario, a number of climate change `symptoms' are
   being detected in Malaysia. Local scholars have looked into the problems
   of rising temperature, rising sea level, extreme rainfall and extreme
   winds, which are causing coastal and mangrove erosion and degradation of
   marine resources. In turn, these issues are affecting the small-scale
   fishermen who rely heavily on weather stability to conduct their social
   and economic routines. This paper analyses six adaptation strategies,
   namely, reducing the risks associated with fishing routines,
   strengthening social relationships, managing fishermen's climate change
   knowledge, facilitating the community's learning of alternative skills,
   involving fishermen in climate change adaptation planning, and enhancing
   fishermen's access to credit. These suggestions are hoped to provide
   basis for concerned parties to develop adaptation strategies that are in
   line with small-scale fishermen's needs, abilities and interests.},

Title = {Climate Warming in Response to Emission Reductions Consistent with the
   Paris Agreement},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {To limit global warming to well below 2 degrees C in accord with the
   Paris Agreement, countries throughout the world have submitted their
   Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their
   greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation actions in the next few decades.
   However, it remains unclear what the resulting climate change is in
   response to the proposed INDCs and subsequent emission reductions. In
   this study, the global and regional warming under the updated INDC
   scenarios was estimated from a range of comprehensive Earth system
   models (CMIP5) and a simpler carbon-climate model (MAGICC), based on the
   relationship of climate response to cumulative emissions.) The global
   GHG emissions under the updated INDC pledges are estimated to reach 14.2
   similar to 15.0 GtC/year in 2030, resulting in a global mean temperature
   increase of 1.29 similar to 1.55 degrees C (median of 1.41 degrees
   C)above the preindustrial level. By extending the INDC scenarios to
   2100, global GHG emissions are estimated to be around 6.4 similar to 9.0
   GtC/year in 2100, resulting in a global mean temperature increase by
   2.67 similar to 3.74 degrees C (median of 3.17 degrees C). The Arctic
   warming is projected to be most profound, exceeding the global average
   by a factor of three by the end of this century.) us, climate warming
   under INDC scenarios is projected to greatly exceed the long-term Paris
   Agreement goal of stabilizing the global mean temperature at to a low
   level of 1.5-2.0 degrees C above the pre-industrial. Our study suggests
   that the INDC emission commitments need to be adjusted and strengthened
   to bridge this warming gap.},

Abstract = {Changes in the environmental heat stress need to be properly evaluated
   to manage the risk of heat-related illnesses, particularly in the
   context of climate change. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a
   useful index for evaluating heat stress and anticipating conditions
   related to heat-related illness in the present climate, but projecting
   the WBGT with a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution
   remains challenging for future climate conditions. In this study, we
   developed a methodological framework for estimating the site-specific
   hourly resolution WBGT based on the output of general circulation models
   using only simple calculations. The method was applied to six sites in
   Japan and its performance was evaluated. The proposed method could
   reproduce the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT with a high accuracy.
   Based on the developed framework, we constructed future (2090s)
   projections under two different greenhouse gas emission pathways. These
   projections showed a consistent rise in the WBGT and thus the capacity
   to perform physically demanding activities is expected to decrease. To
   demonstrate the usefulness of the projected WBGT in planning adaptation
   measures, we identified the optimal working schedules which would
   minimize outdoor workers' exposure to heat at a specific site. The
   results show that a substantial shift in the working time is required in
   the future if outdoor workers are to compensate the effect of increased
   heat exposure only by changing their working hours. This methodological
   framework and the projections will provide local practitioners with
   useful information to manage the increased risk of heat stress under
   climate change.},

Title = {Assessing the Capacity of Adaptive Policy Pathways to Adapt on Time by
   Mapping Trigger Values to Their Outcomes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Climate change raises serious concerns for policymakers that want to
   ensure the success of long-term policies. To guarantee satisfactory
   decisions in the face of deep uncertainties, adaptive policy pathways
   might be used. Adaptive policy pathways are designed to take actions
   according to how the future will actually unfold. In adaptive pathways,
   a monitoring system collects the evidence required for activating the
   next adaptive action. This monitoring system is made of signposts and
   triggers. Signposts are indicators that track the performance of the
   pathway. When signposts reach pre-specified trigger values, the next
   action on the pathway is implemented. The effectiveness of the
   monitoring system is pivotal to the success of adaptive policy pathways,
   therefore the decision-makers would like to have sufficient confidence
   about the future capacity to adapt on time. On time means activating the
   next action on a pathway neither so early that it incurs unnecessary
   costs, nor so late that it incurs avoidable damages. In this paper, we
   show how mapping the relations between triggers and the probability of
   misclassification errors inform the level of confidence that a
   monitoring system for adaptive policy pathways can provide.
   Specifically, we present the trigger-probability mapping and the
   trigger-consequences mappings. The former mapping displays the interplay
   between trigger values for a given signpost and the level of confidence
   regarding whether change occurs and adaptation is needed. The latter
   mapping displays the interplay between trigger values for a given
   signpost and the consequences of misclassification errors for both
   adapting the policy or not. In a case study, we illustrate how these
   mappings can be used to test the effectiveness of a monitoring system,
   and how they can be integrated into the process of designing an adaptive
   policy.},

Title = {Feed additives as a strategic approach to reduce enteric methane
   production in cattle: modes of action, effectiveness and safety},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Number = {14},
Pages = {1303-1317},
Abstract = {Increasing consumer concern in greenhouse-gas (GHG) contributions from
   cattle is pushing the livestock industry to continue to improve their
   sustainability goals. As populations increase, particularly in
   low-income countries, the demand for animal-sourced foods will place
   further pressure to reduce emission intensity. Enteric methane (CH4)
   production contributes to most of the GHG from livestock; therefore, it
   is key to mitigating such emissions. Feed additives have primarily been
   used to increase animal productivity, but advances in understanding the
   rumen has resulted in their development to mitigate CH4 emissions. The
   present study reviewed some of the main feed additives with a potential
   to reduce enteric CH4 emissions, focusing on in vivo studies. Feed
   additives work by either inhibiting methanogenesis or modifying the
   rumen environment, such that CH4 production (g/day) is reduced. Feed
   additives that inhibit methanogenesis or compete with substrate for
   methanogens include 3-nitroxypropanol (3NOP), nitrates, and halogenated
   compounds containing organisms such as macroalgae. Although 3NOP and
   macroalgae affect methyl-coenzyme M reductase enzyme that is necessary
   in CH4 biosynthesis, the former is more specific to methanogens. In
   contrast, nitrates reduce CH4 emissions by competing with methanogens
   for hydrogen. However, nitrite could accumulate in blood and be toxic to
   ruminants. Rumen modifiers do not act directly on methanogens but rather
   on the conditions that promote methanogenesis. These feed additives
   include lipids, plant secondary compounds and essential oils. The
   efficacy of lipids has been studied extensively, and although
   supplementation with medium-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids has
   shown substantial reduction in enteric CH4 production, the results have
   been variable. Similarly, secondary plant compounds and essential oils
   have shown inconsistent results, ranging from substantial reduction to
   modest increase in enteric CH4 emissions. Due to continued interest in
   this area, research is expected to accelerate in developing feed
   additives that can provide options in mitigating enteric CH4 emissions.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the combustion of
   fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change and ocean
   acidification. The implementation of carbon capture and storage
   technologies has been proposed to mitigate the buildup of this
   greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Among these technologies, direct air
   capture is regarded as a plausible CO2 removal tool whereby net negative
   emissions can be achieved. However, the separation of CO2 from air is
   particularly challenging due to the ultradilute concentration of CO2 in
   the presence of high concentrations of dioxygen and water. Here, we
   report a robust electrochemical redox-active amine system demonstrating
   a high electron utilization (i.e., mole of CO2 per mole of electrons) of
   up to 1.25 with the capture of two CO2 molecules per amine in an aqueous
   solution with a work of 101 kJ(e) per moles of CO2. The capture of CO2
   directly from ambient air as the feed gas presented an electron
   utilization of 0.78.},

Title = {The influence of ecosystems services depletion to climate change
   adaptation efforts in Africa},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {779},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of the major challenges societies round the world
   face at present. Apart from efforts to achieve a reduction of emissions
   of greenhouse gases so as to mitigate the problem, there is a perceived
   need for adaptation initiatives urgently. Ecosystems are known to play
   an important role in climate change adaptation processes, since some of
   the services they provide, may reduce the impacts of extreme events and
   disturbance, such as wildfires, floods, and droughts. This role is
   especially important in regions vulnerable to climate change such as the
   African continent, whose adaptation capacity is limited by many
   geographic and socio-economic constraints. In Africa, interventions
   aimed at enhancing ecosystem services may play a key role in supporting
   climate change adaptation efforts. In order to shed some light on this
   aspect, this paper reviews the role of ecosystems services and
   investigates how they are being influenced by climate change in Africa.
   It contains a set of case studies from a sample of African countries,
   which serve the purpose to demonstrate the damages incurred, and how
   such damages disrupt ecosystem services. Based on the data gathered,
   some measures which may assist in fostering the cause of ecosystems
   services are listed, so as to cater for a better protection of some of
   the endangered Africa ecosystems, and the services they provide. (c)

Abstract = {Climate is one of the five soil-forming factors and has a significant
   influence on the properties of soil. India has a great geographic and
   geomorphologic diversity with a number of different climate regimes. We
   sow the seeds in soil, but grow the plants on land that also constitutes
   the climate. Agriculture depends on the mean climate of a particular
   region. Indian agriculture is primarily rain-fed, with a majority of
   farmers dependent on monsoon for irrigating their crops. Drought,
   floods, variation in onset dates, wet and dry spells further pose
   detrimental effects on agriculture. The chapter highlights the effects
   of climate on agriculture and summarizes the climate in various seasons
   in different parts of the country. This also covers the trends of
   various weather parameters over the years. The trends indicate that
   annual mean surface air temperatures have shown significant warming of
   about 0.63 degrees C/100 year during the past 115 years (1901-2015).
   Frequency of depressions and cyclonic storms formed over the north
   Indian Ocean (1951-2015) during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons
   have shown decreasing trends. Through the effects of precipitation and
   temperature, climate affects the rates of biological, chemical and
   physical processes involved in soil formation. The development of soil
   profile and its physical and chemical composition are greatly affected
   by weather and also have a role in crop performance. The chapter also
   covers the impacts of climate change on soil quality, nutrient dynamics,
   organic matter turnover and soil erosion. Possible adaptation and
   mitigation approaches are highlighted. Opportunities for carbon
   sequestration as a tool to mitigate climate change have been pinpointed.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Glaciers, formed from the gradual accumulation of snow, can be
   continuous records representing past environments and recognized as a
   time capsule of our planetary evolution. Due to extremely harsh
   conditions, glacial ice has long been considered an uninhabitable
   ecosystem for microorganisms to sustain their life. However, recent
   developments in microbiological analysis techniques revealed the
   presence of unexpectedly diverse microbial strains. Glacial
   microorganisms could also provide valuable information, including not
   only biological diversity and structure but also molecular systematics,
   metabolic profiles, and evolutionary changes from the past climate and
   ecosystem. However, there are several obstacles in investigating the
   glacier environment, such as low regional accessibility, technical
   difficulties of ice coring, potential contamination during the sampling
   process, and low microbial biomass. This review aims to summarize recent
   knowledge on decontamination methods, biomass, diversity based on
   culture-dependent and -independent methods, application of biological
   proxies, greenhouse gas production and adaptive strategies in glaciers
   from various regions and to imply further directions for a comprehensive
   understanding of habitatility in an icy world including outer of our

Abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up in 1988
   by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations
   Environment Programme to review the stare of knowledge about
   human-induced climate change and assess possible responses. Most of its
   activities are conducted by three working groups, concerned respectively
   with scientific aspects of the climate system, with the vulnerability of
   human and natural systems to climate change, and with options for
   mitigating that change. The major IPCC reports have been highly detailed
   statements of scientific consensus on changes in the climate system,
   issued at roughly five-year intervals. These reflect the input of some
   hundreds of scientists, with drafts scrutinized by expert reviewers,
   revised to attain consensus, and eventually approved (or ``accepted{''})
   by the full Panel. The first such assessment, published in 1990, was
   influential in formulating the Framework Convention on Climate Change
   adopted at the 1992 Rio conference. The second assessment report (SAR),
   Climate Change 1995, produced the winery cited estimate that global
   warming would raise average temperatures by 1 degrees- 3.5 degreesC by
   2100, with a ``best estimate `` of 2 degreesC, and produce a sea-level
   rise of 0.13 - 0.94 meters. That report took the further step of
   explicitly linking the warming to anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions
   of greenhouse gases. Its cautious conclusion: ``The balance of evidence
   suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {151-194},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {So far, climate change mitigation pathways focus mostly on CO2 and a
   limited number of climate targets. Comprehensive studies of emission
   implications have been hindered by the absence of a flexible method to
   generate multi-gas emissions pathways, user-definable in shape and the
   climate target. The presented method `Equal Quantile Walk' (EQW) is
   intended to fill this gap, building upon and complementing existing
   multi-gas emission scenarios. The EQW method generates new mitigation
   pathways by `walking along equal quantile paths' of the emission
   distributions derived from existing multi-gas IPCC baseline and
   stabilization scenarios. Considered emissions include those of CO2 and
   all other major radiative forcing agents (greenhouse gases, ozone
   precursors and sulphur aerosols). Sample EQW pathways are derived for
   stabilization at 350 ppm to 750 ppm CO2 concentrations and compared to
   WRE profiles. Furthermore, the ability of the method to analyze emission
   implications in a probabilistic multi-gas framework is demonstrated. The
   probability of overshooting a 2 degrees C climate target is derived by
   using different sets of EQW radiative forcing peaking pathways. If the
   probability shall not be increased above 30\%, it seems necessary to
   peak CO2 equivalence concentrations around 475 ppm and return to lower
   levels after peaking (below 400 ppm). EQW emissions pathways can be
   applied in studies relating to Article 2 of the UNFCCC, for the analysis
   of climate impacts, adaptation and emission control implications
   associated with certain climate targets. See www.simcap.org for
   EQW-software and data.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change: is there scope for ecological management in
   the face of a global threat?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {42},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of
   species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable
   research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date
   has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for
   adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase
   the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the
   inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce
   trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability
   to climate variability.
   2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to
   impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management
   strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change
   as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some
   regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind
   speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for
   temperature.
   3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a
   given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the
   performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and
   result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural
   resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among
   species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate
   change.
   4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have
   tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial
   distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of
   climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated
   by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and
   interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive
   to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the
   complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in
   parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been
   appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution.
   5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they
   are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the
   construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In
   many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests
   run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased
   environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and
   increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly
   reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited
   dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations
   may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape
   connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural
   experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients
   provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Management of marine mega-fauna in a changing climate is constrained by
   a series of uncertainties, often related to climate change projections,
   ecological responses, and the effectiveness of strategies in alleviating
   climate change impacts. Uncertainties can be reduced over time through
   adaptive management. Adaptive management is a framework for resource
   conservation that promotes iterative learning-based decision making. To
   successfully implement the adaptive management cycle, different steps
   (planning, designing, learning and adjusting) need to be systematically
   implemented to inform earlier steps in an iterative way. Despite the
   critical role that adaptive management is likely to play in addressing
   the impacts of climate change on marine mega-fauna few managers have
   successfully implemented an adaptive management approach. We discuss the
   approaches necessary to implement each step of an adaptive management
   cycle to manage marine mega-fauna in a changing climate, highlighting
   the steps that require further attention to fully implement the process.
   Examples of sharks and rays (Selachimorpha and Batoidea) on the Great
   Barrier Reef and little penguins, Eudyptula minor, in south-eastern
   Australia are used as case studies. We found that successful
   implementation of the full adaptive management cycle to marine
   mega-fauna needs managers and researchers to: (1) obtain a better
   understanding of the capacity of species to adapt to climate change to
   inform the planning step; (2) identify strategies to directly address
   impacts in the marine environment to inform the designing step; and (3)
   develop systematic evaluation and monitoring programs to inform the
   learning step. Further, legislation needs to flexible to allow for
   management to respond.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-254},
Abstract = {The need to find economical methods of CO2 sequestration is now urgent.
   Ocean iron fertilisation has been suggested as a low cost mitigation
   option to capture and store carbon. However, previous methods of
   estimating the cost fail to account for many of the losses and offsets
   occurring over the storage period. A method for calculating the net
   carbon stored from iron fertilisation of high nutrient low chlorophyll
   ocean regions is provided. Ship based fertilisation of the Southern
   Ocean is considered as a case study, on average, a single fertilisation
   is found to result in a net sequestration of 0.01 t C km(-2) for 100
   years at a cost of US\$457 per tonne CO2. Previous estimates of cost
   underestimate the economic challenge of distributing low concentrations
   of iron over large areas of the ocean surface, and the subsequent loss
   processes that result in only a small net storage of carbon per km(2)
   fertilised. Technologies that could lower the cost are discussed.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {243-260},

Abstract = {Ports are experiencing increased pressure to reduce negative impacts on
   climate and environment, and their roles and functions in transport
   systems and economy make them a key factor in promoting sustainability.
   There is substantial research on strategies and measures for mitigating
   emissions and pollution. This paper reviews literature on tools and
   technologies for sustainable ports and presents a typology based on 70
   publications published in peer-reviewed journals. The paper outlines 26
   tools and technologies, across four main categories (i) port management
   and plans, (ii) power and fuels, (iii) sea activities and (iv) land
   activities. The paper further discusses to what extent existing research
   supports port decision makers in their effort towards sustainability. We
   suggest that the literature gives an insufficient foundation for
   decision making in ports. The main reason is that few papers are based
   on empirical findings. We therefore suggest several avenues for
   addressing port sustainability in future research to enable port
   decision makers to select and prioritize tools or technologies:
   increased use of empirical data, port engagement, and understanding
   actors and processes in port decision making.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The success of climate change strategies depends on how well mitigation
   and adaptation measures are implemented. It is especially important to
   implement effective mitigation and adaptation measures in coastal
   territories because they will be more directly affected by some of the
   possible effects of climate change. This study assessed and compared how
   Singapore, Miami-Dade and San Francisco - three coastal territories -
   implement climate change strategies in their construction industries.
   Case study method - in which primary and secondary information was
   collected and analyzed - was used. It was found that these three
   territories have a few similarities; for example, Singapore and San
   Francisco mandate green building requirements, whereas Singapore and
   Miami-Dade do not explicitly consider adaptation measures in their
   building codes. It was also noted that although mitigation has entered
   mainstream policy-making, adaptation still lags behind. Consequently,
   this study has proposed a few lessons; for example, policy-makers in
   Singapore and Miami-Dade should complement existing measures with
   platforms to engage the public on disaster management. Copyright (c)

Title = {The Influence of Volatile Organic Compounds on Climate Change: A brief
   review},
Journal = {REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the increase of anthropic activities has generated
   several environmental and socioeconomic impacts, causing chemical and
   physical changes in Earth's atmosphere. Among them, we can highlight the
   increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, intensified by the
   industrialization and urbanization processes after the industrial
   revolution. In addition to the most common GHGs, volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) emitted by biogenic and anthropogenic sources also
   contribute to the absorption of infrared radiation and the increase in
   the global average surface temperature. VOCs play an important role in
   the atmosphere, such as the formation of photochemical smog, secondary
   aerosols and, consequently, climate change. Furthermore, the occurrence
   of different environmental impacts, such as cyclones, thermal inversion,
   melting glaciers, and rising sea levels, are associated with the
   uncontrolled emission of different VOCs in the atmosphere. Therefore,
   the main objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of VOCs on
   climate change, in addition to proposing some sustainable strategies to
   mitigate the release of these pollutants into the atmosphere, in order
   to control the increase in global warming and reduce the incidence of
   chemical and climatic phenomena, that become more frequent in the
   current scenario.},

Abstract = {Estimates of global wetland area range from 5.3 to 12.8 million km(2).
   About half the global wetland area has been lost, but an international
   treaty (the 1971 Ramsar Convention) has helped 144 nations protect the
   most significant remaining wetlands. Because most nations lack wetland
   inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands
   cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining
   wetlands occupy less than 9\% of the earth's land area, they contribute
   more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area
   implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood
   abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired
   when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are
   improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by
   invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives.
   Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear
   how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend
   adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large
   scales in actual restoration sites.},

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures in urban `heat islands' increase cooling energy
   use and accelerate the formation of urban smog. Urban shade trees and
   light-colored surfaces can offset or reverse the heat island and
   conserve energy. Implementation of heat island mitigation measures is
   now a prominent part of President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan
   to control the emissions of greenhouse gases, necessitating a better
   understanding of the quantitative benefits of these control measures. We
   present recent measurements of the air-conditioning savings for houses
   in Sacramento and Florida, and air temperature measurements at White
   Sands National Monument, New Mexico. We also discuss the results of
   meteorological and smog simulations for the Los Angeles Basin. The
   albedo of a city may be increased gradually if high-albedo surfaces are
   chosen to replace darker materials during routine maintenance of roofs
   and roads. Such high-albedo surfaces may last longer than their
   conventional dark counterparts. Utility-sponsored incentive programs,
   product labeling, and standards could promote the use of high-albedo
   materials for buildings and roads, and several paint manufacturers have
   expressed interest in participating in a `cool surfaces' labeling
   program. We examine the spectral reflectance of various white coatings
   and building materials that might be labeled in such a program.},

Title = {An overview of CO2 mitigation options for global warming - Emphasizing
   CO2 sequestration options},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OF JAPAN},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {361-375},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {CO2 mitigation options have been overviewed from an engineering point of
   view. There have been proposed a number of mitigation options, which can
   be divided into three categories; 1. reduction of energy intensity; 2.
   reduction of carbon intensity; 3. carbon sequestration. In this review
   paper, various mitigation options are reviewed focusing on the carbon
   sequestration options.
   A reduction in energy intensity is essentially an energy saving. A
   reduction in carbon intensity could be achieved by switching to energy
   resources with lower carbon contents. Based on the 2001 IPCC report, the
   mitigation potential related to energy intensity is estimated at
   1,900-2,600 Mt-C/year in 2010, and 3,600-5,050 Mt-C/year in 2020,
   including other greenhouse gas equivalents. There are additional
   benefits in implementing these options; they are economically
   beneficial, and have no associated harmful effects. The carbon
   sequestration options can be divided into two categories; the
   enhancement of the natural sinking rates of CO2, and a direct discharge
   of anthropogenic CO2. The relevant sequestration options in the first
   category include terrestrial sequestration by vegetation, ocean
   sequestration by fertilization, and an enhancement of the rock
   weathering process. In the direct discharge options, the CO2 produced
   from large point sources, such as thermal power stations, would be
   captured and separated, then transported and injected either into the
   ocean or underground. Although the sequestration options are less
   beneficial in terms of cost per unit CO, reduction compared to other
   options, technical developments in sequestration options are necessary
   for the following reasons; 1. A huge potential capacity for carbon
   sequestration, 2. carbon sequestration enables a continuous use of
   fossil fuels, which is unavoidable at the moment, before switching to
   renewable energy sources. Each sequestration option has advantages and
   disadvantages in terms of capacity, cost, the time scale of the
   sequestration, the stability of sequestered CO2, and additional
   environmental impacts, which depend on the location, time, and amount of
   sequestration. Thus, reliable evaluations of the mitigation efficiency
   are essential for each sequestration option upon implementation.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Cities are increasingly incentivizing rooftop photovoltaics (PV) for the
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions together with more urban forestry
   and high albedo surfaces for the mitigation of the urban heat island
   (UHI) effect. Previous interventions are proven to be effective in
   isolation, but their combined performance is seldom considered. Through
   microclimate simulations of a neighbourhood in Brampton, Ontario, this
   study investigates the trade-offs between large-scale deployments of
   rooftop PV, street trees, and cool roofs. The performance of each
   intervention is compared by examining the impact on the PV efficiency
   (and the produced electricity) and the Universal Thermal Climate Index
   (UTCI) values. The study shows that street trees can reduce the energy
   output of rooftop PV significantly depending on their height and
   location, and it confirms the need for solar access laws, currently
   missing in Ontario. Further, this study shows that a large adoption of
   rooftop PV instead of cool roofs can result in an outdoor environment up
   to 0.5 degrees C higher in terms of UTCI during heatwave periods.},

Abstract = {Carbon footprint (CF) refers to the total amount of carbon dioxide and
   its equivalents emitted due to various anthropogenic activities. Carbon
   emission and sequestration inventories have been reviewed sector-wise
   for all federal states in India to identify the sectors and regions
   responsible for carbon imbalances. This would help in implementing
   appropriate climate change mitigation and management strategies at
   disaggregated levels. Major sectors of carbon emissions in India are
   through electricity generation, transport, domestic energy consumption,
   industries and agriculture. A majority of carbon storage occurs in
   forest biomass and soil. This paper focuses on the statewise carbon
   emissions (CO2. CO and CH4), using region specific emission factors and
   statewise carbon sequestration capacity. The estimate shows that CO2, CO
   and CH4 emissions from India are 965.9, 22.5 and 16.9 Tg per year,
   respectively. Electricity generation contributes 35.5\% of total CO2
   emission, which is followed by the contribution from transport.
   Vehicular transport exclusively contributes 25.5\% of total emission.
   The analysis shows that Maharashtra emits higher CO2, followed by Andhra
   Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The carbon
   status, which is the ratio of annual carbon storage against carbon
   emission, for each federal state is computed. This shows that small
   states and union territories (UT) like Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and
   Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where carbon sequestration is higher due to
   good vegetation cover, have carbon status > 1. Annually, 7.35\% of total
   carbon emissions get stored either in forest biomass or soil, out of
   which 34\% is in Arunachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and
   Orissa. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a rise in temperatures,
   accompanied by rising sea levels threatening low-lying coastal cities.
   This vulnerability is especially acute in developing countries' cities.
   This study reviews whether Bangkok, Manila, and Jakarta, less prepared
   emerging urban centers of developing countries, are investing in
   adaptation projects for resilience against sea-level rise and urban
   flooding. Sea-level rise and urban flooding resilience projects were
   identified in the selected cities through secondary research methods,
   data on multilateral climate funds, and other aggregated funding
   databases such as Aid Atlas, Cities Adaptation Action, and City Risk
   Index. Our findings show that even though these cities do have some
   adaptation projects to address coastal flooding and rising sea-level
   threats, the funding has been disparate and dispersed due to a lack of
   continuous, sizeable, and diverse financing options and does not come
   close to the requirement, given the risks, of covering potential
   disaster-related losses. Our findings further highlight the need to
   expand financing beyond multilateral funds and bilateral funding
   agreements and to include financial mechanisms that incentivize
   potential stakeholders to invest in projects that ordinarily are
   considered nonrevenue generating.},

Abstract = {Future changes in the North American monsoon, a circulation system that
   brings abundant summer rains to vast areas of the North American
   Southwest(1,2,cou)ld have significant consequences for regional water
   resources(3). How this monsoon will change with increasing greenhouse
   gases, however, remains unclear(4-6,) not least because coarse
   horizontal resolution and systematic sea-surface temperature biases
   limit the reliability of its numerical model simulations(5,7). Here we
   investigate the monsoon response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide
   (CO2) concentrations using a 50-km-resolution global climate model which
   features a realistic representation of the monsoon climatology and its
   synoptic-scale variability8. It is found that the monsoon response to
   CO2 doubling is sensitive to sea-surface temperature biases. When
   minimizing these biases, the model projects a robust reduction in
   monsoonal precipitation over the southwestern United States, contrasting
   with previous multi-model assessments(4,9). Most of this precipitation
   decline can be attributed to increased atmospheric stability, and hence
   weakened convection, caused by uniform sea-surface warming. These
   results suggest improved adaptation measures, particularly water
   resource planning, will be required to cope with projected reductions in
   monsoon rainfall in the American Southwest.},

   feedbacks from the ocean may exacerbate climate change. There is clear
   evidence for rapid change in the oceans. As the main heat store for the
   world there has been an accelerating change in sea temperatures over the
   last few decades, which has contributed to rising sea-level. The oceans
   are also the main store of carbon dioxide (CO2), and are estimated to
   have taken up similar to 40\% of anthropogenic-sourced CO2 from the
   atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. A
   proportion of the carbon uptake is exported via the four ocean `carbon
   pumps' (Solubility, Biological, Continental Shelf and Carbonate Counter)
   to the deep ocean reservoir. Increases in sea temperature and changing
   planktonic systems and ocean currents may lead to a reduction in the
   uptake of CO2 by the ocean; some evidence suggests a suppression of
   parts of the marine carbon sink is already underway. While the oceans
   have buffered climate change through the uptake of CO2 produced by
   fossil fuel burning this has already had an impact on ocean chemistry
   through ocean acidification and will continue to do so. Feedbacks to
   climate change from acidification may result from expected impacts on
   marine organisms (especially corals and calcareous plankton), ecosystems
   and biogeochemical cycles. The polar regions of the world are showing
   the most rapid responses to climate change. As a result of a strong
   ice-ocean influence, small changes in temperature, salinity and ice
   cover may trigger large and sudden changes in regional climate with
   potential downstream feedbacks to the climate of the rest of the world.
   A warming Arctic Ocean may lead to further releases of the potent
   greenhouse gas methane from hydrates and permafrost. The Southern Ocean
   plays a critical role in driving, modifying and regulating global
   climate change via the carbon cycle and through its impact on adjacent
   Antarctica. The Antarctic Peninsula has shown some of the most rapid
   rises in atmospheric and oceanic temperature in the world, with an
   associated retreat of the majority of glaciers. Parts of the West
   Antarctic ice sheet are deflating rapidly, very likely due to a change
   in the flux of oceanic heat to the undersides of the floating ice
   shelves. The final section on modelling feedbacks from the ocean to
   climate change identifies limitations and priorities for model
   development and associated observations. Considering the importance of
   the oceans to climate change and our limited understanding of
   climate-related ocean processes, our ability to measure the changes that
   are taking place are conspicuously inadequate. The chapter highlights
   the need for a comprehensive, adequately funded and globally extensive
   ocean observing system to be implemented and sustained as a high
   priority. Unless feedbacks from the oceans to climate change are
   adequately included in climate change models, it is possible that the
   mitigation actions needed to stabilise CO2 and limit temperature rise
   over the next century will be underestimated.},

Title = {Adaptation to Climate Change: A Fishery Technology Perspective},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE WHITE WORLD},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {61-75},
Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have direct and indirect impacts on
   capture and culture fisheries, for fishers, coastal communities and
   fisheries-dependent economies. Capture fisheries by fishing vessels, is
   mostly driven by fossil fuels that contribute to greenhouse gas
   emissions and forms one the largest contributor from the fisheries
   sector. Transportation of catches, from the landing centers using
   different modes of transport is another source of emissions which
   contribute significantly to the emissions. Fisheries may be impacted in
   different ways, which include changes in the distribution of species due
   to latitudinal shifts or changes in the productivity of the system
   through processes that are repercussions due to climate-induced changes.
   A diverse range of direct and indirect climate affects, including
   displacement and migration of coastal communities; impacts on
   infrastructure for fishing; and changes in the frequency, intensity and
   distribution of extreme events are predicted. The poorer and less
   empowered countries and individuals are more vulnerable to climate
   impacts, and the vulnerability of fisheries is likely to be higher in
   circumstances of overcapacity and over exploitation.
   The interactions related to climate change is often complex, which
   includes interactions between social, ecological and economic systems,
   and this makes future predictions very difficult, however steps are
   required to develop models that could help the policy makers to frame
   adaptation strategies. Fisheries governance should aim towards equitable
   and sustainable options and should be flexible enough to account for
   inherent uncertainties in the fisheries sector. However, adaptation may
   be costly, so mitigation of emissions and other factors that contribute
   significantly to climate related issues should be the main recourse.},

Title = {Intercomparison Study of the Impact of Climate Change on Renewable
   Energy Indicators on the Mediterranean Islands},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The enhanced vulnerability of insular regions to climate change has been
   recently recognized by the European Union, which highlights the
   importance of undertaking adaptation and mitigation strategies according
   to the specific singularities of the islands. In general, islands are
   highly dependent on energy imports which, in turn, feature a marked
   seasonal demand. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in these
   regions can therefore fulfill a twofold objective: (i) to increase the
   renewable energy share for global decarbonization and (ii) to reduce the
   external energy dependence for isolated (or interconnected) systems in
   which this can only be achieved with an increase of the renewable energy
   share. However, the increase in renewable technologies makes energy
   generation more dependent on future climate and its variability. The
   main aim of this study is to analyze future projections of wind and
   photovoltaic potential, as well as energy productivity droughts, on the
   main Euro-Mediterranean islands. Due to the limitations in land surface
   available in the islands for the installation of renewable energy
   capacity, the analysis is extended to offshore wind and photovoltaic
   energy, which may have an important role in the future increases of
   renewable energy share. To that end, we use climate variables from a
   series of simulations derived from Euro-CORDEX (Coordinated Downscaling
   Experiment) simulations for the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. A
   special effort is performed to normalize projected changes and the
   associated uncertainties. The obtained normalized changes make it easier
   the intercomparison between the results obtained in the different
   islands and constitute condensed and valuable information that aims to
   facilitate climate-related policy decision making for decarbonization
   and Blue Growth in the islands.},

Abstract = {A series of coupled atmosphere-ocean-land global climate model (GCM)
   simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
   Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM3) has been performed for the
   period 1870-2099 at a T85 horizontal resolution following the GCM
   experimental design suggested in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). First, a hindcast was
   performed using the atmospheric concentrations of three greenhouse gases
   (CO2, CH4, N2O) specified annually and globally on the basis of
   observations for the period 1870-1999. The hindcast results were
   compared with observations to evaluate the GCM's reliability in future
   climate simulations. Second, climate projections for a 100-year period
   (2000-2099) were made using six scenarios of the atmospheric
   concentrations of the three greenhouse gases according to the A1FI, A1T,
   A1B, A2, B1, and B2 emission profiles of the Special Report on Emissions
   Scenarios. The present CCSM simulations are found to be consistent with
   IPCC's AR4 results in the temporal and spatial distributions for both
   the present-day and future periods. The GCM results were used to examine
   the changes in extreme temperatures and precipitation in East Asia and
   Korea. The extreme temperatures were categorized into warm and cold
   events: the former includes tropical nights, warm days, and heat waves
   during summer (June-July-August) and the latter includes frost days,
   cold days, and cold surges during winter (December-January-February).
   Focusing on Korea, the results predict more frequent heat waves in
   response to future emissions: the projected percentage changes between
   the present day and the late 2090s range from 294\% to 583\% depending
   on the emission scenario. The projected global warming is predicted to
   decrease the frequency of cold extreme events; however, the projected
   changes in cold surge frequency are not statistically significant.
   Whereas the number of cold surges in the A1FI emission profile decreases
   from the present-day value by up to 24\%, the decrease in the B1
   scenario is less than 1\%. The frequency and intensity of extreme
   precipitation events year-round were examined. Both the frequency and
   the intensity of these events are predicted to increase in the region
   around Korea. The present results will be helpful for establishing an
   adaptation strategy for possible climate change nationwide, especially
   extreme climate events, associated with global warming.},

Abstract = {This study involves the assessment of the potential impacts of
   greenhouse gas climate change and changing ambient carbon dioxide (CO2)
   levels on crop yields in Quebec, Canada. The methodology involves
   coupling the transient diagnostics of two Atmosphere-Ocean General
   Circulation Models, namely the Canadian CGCM1 and the British HadCM3, to
   the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) 3.5 crop
   models to simulate current (1961-1990) and future (2040-2069) crop
   yields and changes. This is done for four different crop species, namely
   spring wheat, maize, soybean, and potato, and for seven agricultural
   regions of Southern Quebec. The results of this study focus on the main
   causative factors influencing crop yields, namely the direct CO2
   fertilization effect, the influence of the increase in growing season
   temperature, including optimal thermal conditions and acceleration in
   crop maturation, soil moisture availability, as influenced by
   precipitation and evapotranspiration, and nitrogen uptake by crops. Our
   results show that crop yield changes may vary according to climate
   scenario, crop species, and agricultural region. Consistent with other
   similar research, it would seem that these multiple causative factors
   very often seem to cancel each other out and dilute the impacts of
   climate change on crop yields.},

Abstract = {Developing and implementing effective adaptation policies for freshwater
   and estuarine systems in Australia will be a significant challenge in a
   rapidly changing climate. The broad aims of climate change adaptation
   policies are to reduce vulnerability and increase the adaptive capacity
   and resilience of ecosystems to climate change impacts. There are a
   range of adaptation policy options relevant to aquatic systems, and many
   of these measures can be `mainstreamed' or incorporated into existing
   conservation and resource management frameworks. This article evaluates
   adaptation policy options and the constraints on policy implementation
   for freshwater and estuarine ecosystems in the coastal floodplains of
   tropical Queensland. Many of these aquatic systems are in a degraded
   condition and are vulnerable to the compounded impacts of climate change
   and other stressors. The analysis suggests that statutory planning
   schemes, water resource planning and protected area frameworks provide
   limited scope to address the more severe threats to these systems from
   rising sea levels, extreme cyclones, floods and droughts. In many
   locations, the effectiveness of adaptation policies is constrained by
   existing land uses and competing demands from communities and industry
   sectors. To prevent further widespread loss of habitat may require the
   development and implementation of new policies that prioritise
   adaptation management for freshwater and estuarine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Limiting climate change to less than 2 degrees C is the focus of
   international policy under the climate convention (UNFCCC), and is
   essential to preventing extinctions, a focus of the Convention on
   Biological Diversity (CBD). The post-2020 biodiversity framework drafted
   by the CBD proposes conserving 30\% of both land and oceans by 2030.
   However, the combined impact on extinction risk of species from limiting
   climate change and increasing the extent of protected and conserved
   areas has not been assessed. Here we create conservation spatial plans
   to minimize extinction risk in the tropics using data on 289 219 species
   and modeling two future greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCP2.6
   and 8.5) while varying the extent of terrestrial protected land and
   conserved areas from <17\% to 50\%. We find that limiting climate change
   to 2 degrees C and conserving 30\% of terrestrial area could more than
   halve aggregate extinction risk compared with uncontrolled climate
   change and no increase in conserved area.},

Abstract = {Earth System models (ESMs) are global climate models with the added
   capability to explicitly represent biogeochemical processes that
   interact with the physical climate and so alter its response to forcing
   such as that associated with human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases.
   Representing the global carbon cycle allows for feedbacks between the
   physical climate and the biological and chemical processes in the ocean
   and on land that take up some of the emitted carbon dioxide and so act
   to reduce warming. The sulfur cycle is also important in that both
   natural and human emissions of sulfur contribute to the production of
   sulfate aerosols which reflect incoming solar radiation (a direct
   cooling effect) and alter cloud properties (an indirect cooling effect).
   Other components such as ozone are also being incorporated into some
   ESMs. Evaluating the physical component of an ESM is becoming
   increasingly comprehensive and sophisticated, but the evaluation of the
   biogeochemical components suffer somewhat from a lack of comprehensive
   global-scale observational data. Nevertheless, such models provide
   valuable insight into climate variability and change, and the role of
   human activities and possible mitigation actions on future climate
   change. Internationally coordinated experiments are increasingly
   important in providing a multimodel ensemble of climate simulations,
   thereby taking advantage of some `cancellation of errors' and allowing
   better quantification of uncertainty. (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors of global
   society. Agricultural production continues to expand into forest lands
   and marginal crop areas, in an attempt to keep pace with the
   ever-increasing world population. Environmental damage is increasing,
   including erosion, salinity, desertification, deforestation, threats, to
   biodiversity, and water scarcity. Moreover, climate change/variability
   is having a profound influence on agroecosystems, posing serious threats
   to food security, human, health, and protection of the environment.
   Thus, comprehensive agrometeorological adaptation policy guidelines,
   focusing on preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation measures to support
   sustainable agricultural development, are needed to cope with the
   impacts of climate change/variability. Adaptation policy can not be an
   effective ``stand alone{''} strategy, but should be incorporated into a
   broader policy objective. For example, adaptation to climate change
   should be a part of a broader socio-economic policy such as
   agricultural, forest, water resources, natural resources, or
   coastal-zone management policy. Poorer countries that will require
   resources to improve capacity in order to cope with impacts, undertake
   specific adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a growing threat to biodiversity, particularly in
   biodiversity-rich places such as tropical forests and coral reefs. At
   the same time, tropical deforestation is a major source of carbon
   emissions. Climate change mitigation measures may have positive impacts
   on deforestation, usually by design, or negative impacts, such as the
   destruction of tropical forests as an indirect result of American corn
   ethanol production. More generally, biodiversity and climate change both
   raise issues about the legality and effectiveness of bottom-up actions
   in the absence of global agreement.
   The typical approach to reducing undesirable activities such as
   deforestation or overfishing is to regulate the actors who produce them
   (the ``suppliers{''} of these destructive activities). But another
   approach is to reduce the demand that drives these activities. These
   methods can be considered demand side because they attempt to reduce the
   demand for deforestation or overfishing, rather than regulating the
   farmers, developers, and fishers who produce these activities. Climate
   change and biodiversity threats both have links to the global food
   system. Conversion of land to agricultural use is a major threat to wild
   lands that store large amounts of carbon and harbor immense
   biodiversity. Increased crop yields, dietary changes, and population
   control can reduce these pressures, benefitting both biodiversity and
   the climate. The ocean's fish are also heavily over-utilized, and
   sustainable aquaculture can reduce pressures on wild fish stocks.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The devastations and damages caused by climate change are apparent
   across the globe, specifically in the South Asian region where
   vulnerabilities to climate change among residents are high and climate
   change adaptation and mitigation awareness are extremely low. Pakistan's
   low adaptive capacity due to high poverty rate, limited financial
   resources and shortage of physical resources, and continual extreme
   climatic events including varying temperature, continual flooding,
   melting glaciers, saturation of lakes, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms,
   avalanches, droughts, scarcity of water, pest diseases, human healthcare
   issues, and seasonal and lifestyle changes have persistently threatened
   the ecosystem, biodiversity, human communities, animal habitations,
   forests, lands, and oceans with a potential to cause further damages in
   the future. The likely effect of climate change on common residents of
   Pakistan with comparison to the world and their per capita impact of
   climate change are terribly high with local animal species such as
   lions, vultures, dolphins, and tortoise facing extinction regardless of
   generating and contributing diminutively to global GHG emissions. The
   findings of the review suggested that GHG emissions cause climate change
   which has impacted agriculture livestock and forestry, weather trends
   and patterns, food water and energy security, and society of Pakistan.
   This review is a sectorial evaluation of climate change mitigation and
   adaption approaches in Pakistan in the aforementioned sectors and its
   economic costs which were identified to be between 7 to 14 billion USD
   per annum. The research suggested that governmental interference is
   essential for sustainable development of the country through strict
   accountability of resources and regulation implemented in the past for
   generating state-of-the-art climate policy.},

Abstract = {The feedback based integrated assessment model ANEMI\_2 represents the
   society-biosphere-climate-economy-energy system of the earth and
   biosphere. The ANEMI\_2 model is based on the system dynamics simulation
   approach that (a) allows for the understanding and modeling of complex
   global change and (b) assists in the investigation of possible policy
   options for mitigating, and/or adapting to changing global conditions
   within an integrated assessment modeling framework. This paper outlines
   the ANEMI\_2 model and its nine system components: climate, carbon
   cycle, land-use, population, food production, hydrologic cycle, water
   demand, water quality, and energy-economy. To evaluate market and
   nonmarket costs and benefits of climate change, the ANEMI\_2 model
   integrates an economic optimization approach, with a focus on the
   international energy stock and fuel price, climate interrelations and
   temperature change. The model takes into account all major greenhouse
   gases (GHG) influencing global temperature and sea-level variation.
   Results from several scenarios (a) compare well with other information
   available in the scientific literature, (b) present comprehensive
   response of the society-biosphere-climate-economy-energy system to the
   selected scenarios, and (c) confirm the support role of the ANEMI\_2
   model in the policy development and analyses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A transdisciplinary modeling framework for the participatory design of
   dynamic adaptive policy pathways},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Efficient policymaking is crucial towards climate change mitigation.
   However, policies' successful implementation depends largely on the
   context where they are applied. Classic decision-making used to be based
   on a static plan that was considered optimal for the ``most likely{''}
   future contextual outcome. However, predicting the most probable
   evolution of this context has been proved unsuccessful, since it is
   vulnerable to unanticipated parameter change. Dynamic Adaptive Policy
   Pathways can address this problem focusing on the design of short-term
   policies, with simultaneous definition of adaptive interventions to be
   chosen on the long-term. This article presents a transdisciplinary
   modeling framework, which builds on the original Dynamic Adaptive Policy
   Pathways methodology. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework
   the authors used it to explore the evolution of the small-scale solar
   photovoltaics share in Greece, towards the achievement of the national
   capacity targets of 2025 and 2030. Model outcomes facilitated the
   identification of several pathways achieving the capacity targets, while
   reducing the risk for retroactive policy changes. Overall, the presented
   study demonstrates potential to support the design of adaptive policies
   over contextual evolutions so that social, economic and technological
   aspects of integrative planning are balanced towards the achievement of
   climate targets.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a variation in atmospheric properties due to natural
   and human activities over a long period of time. In the last few
   decades, there was a significant change in the gaseous composition of
   earth's atmosphere, mainly through increased energy use in industry and
   agriculture sectors, viz. deforestation, intensive cultivation, land use
   change, management practices, etc. These activities lead to increase the
   emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
   etc., popularly known as the ``greenhouse gases{''} (GHGs), and rise up
   the temperature. These GHGs cause regional and global changes in the
   climate-related parameters such as rainfall, soil moisture, and sea
   level. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected
   temperature rise from 0.5 to 1.2 degrees C by 2020, 0.88 to 3.16 degrees
   C by 2050, and 1.56-5.44 degrees C by 2080 for India. To mitigate this
   climate change, among the different means, soil is also one of the key
   components of the agricultural production system, and it needs to be
   relooked in the view of the environment. Soil not only acts as a sink
   for GHGs but also as a source from agriculture. In this regard,
   concerted efforts are necessary for adverse climate change impact to
   reduce the vulnerability of agriculture. To meet out these issues,
   sources and mitigation options for individual gases from the soil are
   discussed in this chapter. Sources of CH4 emission are due to microbial
   decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) under the submerged
   condition, burning of crop residue, and the enteric fermentation. The
   N2O is through fertilizers by the process of nitrification and
   denitrification. The major carbon (C) sources are tillage, burning of
   crop residue, and fossil fuel combustion. To overcome the emission of
   GHGs from the soil, the nature of the release of individual gas and its
   specific management can give an idea of sustaining soil health to
   safeguard the environment. Hence, reducing these GHGs emission from the
   soil through light to overcome the climate change effect. Reduction of
   CH4 gas mainly from rice can be done by the adoption of intermittent
   irrigation, planting methods, fertilizer type, etc. Nitrification
   inhibitors from plant-derived organics such as neem oil, neem cake, and
   Karanja seed extract could also reduce the N2O emission. Also, the
   demand-driven nitrogen (N) application using a leaf colour chart (LCC)
   reduces N2O emission. By using legume crops in rotation helps to reduce
   the N2O emission besides fixing long time C in the belowground. To
   reduce CO2 emission from the agriculture, sequestering C through
   agroforestry system, conservation agriculture, perennial crops, etc.
   could be the effective strategies for assimilating and storing C for a
   long time in soil.},

   America, Europe, and the South Pacific, encompassing fisheries
   literature with and without a climate change focus, to compare how,
   when, and by whom interventions are currently or potentially
   implemented. We expected that adaptation options within a climate change
   context would have a greater focus on enhancing social resilience due to
   a connection with climate change adaptation assessment methodology.
   Instead, we found a greater focus on ecological resilience, likely
   indicating a focus on management adaptation. This pattern, along with
   the more extensive use of social adaptation options responsively and
   outside the context of climate change, along with an importance in
   bottom-up influences in implementing them, suggests a general lack of
   centralized planning and organization with regards to adaptation of
   stakeholders. Determining how adaptation options are created, chosen,
   and implemented is a crucial step within or external to ecosystem-based
   management, especially if planned stakeholder adaption is the goal.},

Abstract = {Local governments are not adapting to sea-level rise because it is
   difficult to build consensus on the need for change the best way to
   implement it. In theory, adaptation pathways can resolve this impasse.
   Adaptation pathways are a sequence of linked strategies that are
   triggered by a change in environmental condition, and in which initial
   decisions can have low regrets and preserve options for future
   generations. We report on a project that sought to empirically test the
   relevance and feasibility of a local pathway for adapting to sea-level
   rise. We find that triggers of change that have social impacts are
   salient to local people, and developing a local adaptation pathway helps
   build consensus among diverse constituencies. Our results show that
   adaptation pathways are feasible at the local scale, offering a
   low-risk, low-cost way to begin the long process of adaptation to
   sea-level rise.},

Title = {Role of social protection in coping strategies for floods in poor
   households: A case study on the impact of Program Keluarga Harapan on
   labor households in Indonesia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Limited access to capital influences how the poor define coping
   strategies, while dealing with disaster impacts. A synergizing
   intervention needs to consider improving the adaptation process, as well
   as protecting the poor from slipping deeper into poverty. The
   intervention of social protection programs, such as Program Keluarga
   Harapan (PKH), could help poor households arrange coping strategies in
   dealing with natural disasters. PKH is a conditional cash program for
   poor households, and includes traditional labor in the coastal city of
   Pekalongan, Indonesia. This research attempted to explore the
   relationship between PKH and coping strategies, when dealing with
   natural disasters through livelihood capital. The first objective of
   this research was to confirm whether PKH can influence coping
   strategies. The second was to discover how PKH can improve ex-ante and
   ex-post strategies, including the key factors for improvement. Using
   confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, we found
   a connection between the PKH intervention and coping strategies. The
   effect of PKH intervention on coping strategies was based on a two-time
   scheme: before the flood (ex-ante) and after the flood (ex-post). The
   two models revealed that PKH encourages ex-ante and ex-post coping
   strategies for floods through livelihood capital. PKH has the potential
   to play an additional role in disaster risk reduction for low-income
   households and finding social/financial capital, thereby encouraging
   ex-ante and ex-post strategies. Another finding was that incorporating
   PKH into disaster risk reduction and linking it to human and physical
   capital will improve its efficiency. This research provides the initial
   and basic arguments on integrating the poverty reduction and disaster
   risk reduction approaches, and strategizing an inclusive and efficient
   way of developing the livelihood resilience of poor people.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the importance of the implementation and

   at the current and expected impact of the ships' energy efficiency
   measures developed under auspices of the International Maritime
   Organization, i.e.: the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the
   Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) on climate change
   mitigation. Both of them, EEDI and SEEMP became mandatory measures after
   the adoption of amendments to the Annex VI of the International
   Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), and
   their entry into force in 2013. Furthermore, those measures were also
   the first legally binding tools relating to climate change, adopted

Pages = {1858-1871},

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper reviews the past and future trends of climate change
   in Malaysia, the major contributors of greenhouse gases and the impacts
   of climate change to Malaysia. It also reviews the mitigation and
   adaptations undertaken, and future strategies to manage the impacts of
   regional climate change.
   Methodology: The review encompasses historical climate data comprising
   mean daily temperature, precipitation, mean sea level and occurrences of
   extreme weather events. Future climate projections have also been
   reviewed in addition to scholarly papers and news articles related to
   impacts, contributors, mitigation and adaptations in relation to climate
   change.
   Findings: The review shows that annual mean temperature, occurrences of
   extreme weather events and mean sea level are rising while rainfall
   shows variability. Future projections point to continuous rise of
   temperature and mean sea level till the end of the 21st century, highly
   variable rainfall and increased frequency of extreme weather events.
   Climate change impacts particularly on agriculture, forestry,
   biodiversity, water resources, coastal and marine resources, public
   health and energy. The energy and waste management sectors are the major
   contributors to climate change. Mitigation of and adaptations to climate
   change in Malaysia revolve around policy setting, enactment of laws,
   formulation and implementation of plans and programmes, as well as
   global and regional collaborations, particularly for energy, water
   resources, agriculture and biodiversity. There are apparent shortcomings
   in continuous improvement and monitoring of the programmes as well as
   enforcement of the relevant laws.
   Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the
   major themes of climate change in Malaysia and recommends pertinent ways
   forward to fill the gaps of mitigation and adaptations already
   implemented. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Strengthening climate change scenario research is a prerequisite for
   reducing the impact of climate change on the marine system. This paper
   systematically reviews the evolution of climate change scenarios from
   three aspects: its meaning, main characteristics and application. The
   results show that: (1) Different climate scenarios have played an
   important role in previous IPCC assessment reports. Special report on
   emission scenario (SRES) reduce the difference of climate simulation
   results among different research teams. Representative concentration
   path (RCP) scenarios strengthen the reference role of emission scenarios
   for researchers and decision makers in research and response to climate
   change. Shared socioeconomic path (SSP) scenarios integrate climate
   policy and socio-economic scenarios to better meet climate change.
   Research group needs of response, adaptation and vulnerability; (2)
   Scenario generation technology has gone through three stages of
   historical data space-time analogy, serial development and parallel
   development, the improvement of which shortens the development cycle and
   enhances the consistency of results; (3) The difference of different
   scenarios is reflected in the characteristics and applications of
   scenarios, and links the mapping between SRS, RCP and SSP scenarios.},

Title = {Farmers' Net Income Distribution and Regional Vulnerability to Climate
   Change: An Empirical Study of Bangladesh},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Widespread poverty is the most serious threat and social problem that
   Bangladesh faces. Regional vulnerability to climate change threatens to
   escalate the magnitude of poverty. It is essential that poverty
   projections be estimated while bearing in mind the effects of climate
   change. The main purpose of this paper is to perform an agrarian
   sub-national regional analysis of climate change vulnerability in
   Bangladesh under various climate change scenarios and evaluate its
   potential impact on poverty. This study is relevant to socio-economic
   research on climate change vulnerability and agriculture risk management
   and has the potential to contribute new insights to the complex
   interactions between household income and climate change risks to
   agricultural communities in Bangladesh and South Asia. This study uses
   analysis of variance, cluster analysis, decomposition of variance and
   log-normal distribution to estimate the parameters of income variability
   that can be used to ascertain vulnerability levels and help us to
   understand the poverty levels that climate change could potentially
   generate. It is found that the levels and sources of income vary greatly
   among regions of Bangladesh. The variance decomposition of income showed
   that agricultural income in Mymensingh and Rangpur is the main cause of
   the total income difference among all sources of income. Moreover, a
   large variance in agricultural income among regions is induced by the
   gross income from rice production. Additionally, even in the long run
   the gradual, constant reduction of rice yield due to climate change in
   Bangladesh is not a severe problem for farmers. However, extreme events
   such as floods, flash floods, droughts, sea level rise and greenhouse
   gas emissions, based on Representative concentration pathways (RCPs),
   could increase the poverty rates in Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Barisal and
   Khulnaregions that would be greatly affected by unexpected yield losses
   due to extreme climatic events. Therefore, research into and development
   of adaptation measures to climate change in regions where farmers are
   largely dependent on agricultural income are important.},

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage is a viable greenhouse gas mitigation
   technology and the Sleipner CO2 sequestration site in the North Sea is
   an excellent example. Storage of CO2 at the Sleipner site requires
   monitoring over large areas, which can successfully be accomplished with
   time lapse seismic imaging. One of the main goals of CO2 storage
   monitoring is to be able to estimate the volume of the stored CO2 in the
   reservoir. This requires a parametrization of the subsurface as exact as
   possible. Here we use elastic 2D time-domain full waveform inversion in
   a time lapse manner to obtain a P-wave velocity constrain directly in
   the depth domain for a base line survey in 1994 and two post-injection
   surveys in 1999 and 2006. By relating velocity change to free CO2
   saturation, using a rock physics model, we find that at the considered
   location the aquifer may have been fully saturated in some places in
   1999 and 2006.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic activity mainly burning of fossil fuels like coal, gas and
   oil is one of the major reasons which increase concentration of
   earth-warming gases. Chief among these gases is carbon dioxide. As per
   the data in last 250 years, CO2 level increases from 250 to more than
   280 parts per million (PPM). Major consequences of this rise in CO2
   level involve disturbance in climatic factors such as sea level rise;
   floods; droughts; changes in the amount, timing and distribution of
   rain; increased frequency and intensity of wildfires and disturbance of
   coastal marine and other ecosystems. That is why control over CO2
   production and reducing CO2 level become important. One of the natural
   ways to CO2 control involves CO2 sequestration which involves removal of
   CO2 from atmosphere or storage of CO2 from emission sources to
   vegetation, soil and sediments. Biological carbon sequestration has
   opened up a new area of research towards enhancing rapid fixation of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide in present level to reduce and mitigate
   global warming and climate change. This chapter describes various
   sources of carbon dioxide with relation to increasing greenhouse gases.
   It also includes scientific basis for current understanding of climate
   change and the role of biological carbon sequestration like soil,
   grassland, peatland and forests for mitigating the increasing
   atmospheric CO2 concentration.},

Abstract = {The current rural dwelling pattern in the Delta in Egypt consumes much
   energy to achieve dwellers' thermal comfort, increasing greenhouse gas
   emissions contributing to climate change threatening the region's
   coastal parts. Therefore, this study highlights the potential of
   retrofitting the existing rural house utilizing pervasive construction
   technologies in diminishing energy consumption and carbon dioxide
   emissions as a climate change mitigation strategy. The current modern
   rural house and the construction typologies were characterized. This
   study selected a typical modern rural dwelling located in Al-Gharbia
   Governorate in the Delta region. The suggested retrofitting strategies
   were applied to the external building envelope. The impact on the annual
   energy consumption of cooling and heating loads was evaluated using an
   Energy Performance Assessment Tool (Design Builder). An optimal envelope
   configuration was suggested, then an economic assessment and an
   investigation to the local acceptance were provided. The results showed
   that using the commonly used construction techniques as a retrofitting
   strategy can plummet the energy consumption and CO2 emissions by
   one-third worthy of mentioning that the locals have shown a lack of
   interest in the investment in retrofitting their buildings as well as
   the economic model showed that the investment is not profitable. Further
   studies can be made by the author considering investigating different
   building typologies and engaging other stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Global climate change has become a critical issue due to the global
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions dominated by carbon dioxide (CO2).
   Forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly essential in mitigating
   climate change by absorbing the atmospheric CO2 and storing it in tree
   biomass, a process known as carbon sequestration. Decades of
   environmental valuation research show that forest carbon has a positive
   economic impact. Economic valuation of forest carbon provides mechanism
   for climate change mitigation policy instruments, compare rival forestry
   and environmental initiatives, and infuse public willingness to pay in
   forest conservation projects. It is also required for carbon trading,
   conservation, and management of the forests. However, carbon storage
   estimates in forest ecosystems throughout the world differ
   substantially. Thus, this study conducts a global meta-analysis to
   estimate the marginal economic value of forest carbon per hectare. A
   systematic review of scientific literature leads to the selection of 60
   primary studies from 30 different countries published between 1990 to
   2021. The meta-analysis identified wide variations in economic values of
   forest carbon across the globe. The outcome of the meta-analysis reveals
   that global economic value of forest carbon is USD2005 per hectare. This
   study provides an insight on the marginal economic value of global
   forest carbon which would be helpful to understand the necessity of
   avoiding deforestation and conserving more forested areas that
   ultimately helps to mitigate global climate change through emission
   reduction.},

Abstract = {The changes in human behaviour associated with the spread of COVID-19
   infections have changed the urban environment.However, little is known
   about the extent to which they have changed the urban climate,
   especially in air temperature (T), anthropogenic heat emission (Q(F))
   and electricity consumption (EC). We quantitatively evaluated these
   effects using a unique method that integrates real-time human population
   data (social big data) with an urban climate model. The results showed
   that in an office district in the city centre of Tokyo, the biggest
   metropolis in the world, under a significantly reduced population, EC
   (CO2 emissions) would be 30\% and QF would be 33\% of pre-COVID levels
   (without the stay-at-home advisories). This resulted in a T decrease of
   about 0.2 degrees C, representing about 20\% of the past greenhouse
   gas-induced warming (about 1.0 degrees C) in Tokyo. This method can be
   benchmarked and then applied to worldwide. The results suggest that
   changes in human behaviour can represent an adaptation and decarbonising
   strategies to climate change in cities.},

Abstract = {Ocean disposal of CO2 may prove to be one of the mitigation strategies
   adopted to alleviate the build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
   At present, four primary ocean disposal scenarios are being evaluated
   through modelling and process studies. These include: 1) deep CO2 lake
   storage, 2) enhanced aqua-farming, 3) injection of CO2 from a fixed
   source, and 4) injection of CO2 from a moving ship source. Global ocean
   circulation models and carbon cycle models have previously simulated the
   spreading and sequestration efficiency of numerous fixed injection
   locations and depths (e.g. Dewey et al., 1996). In general, they have
   found that the injection of CO2 at greater depths and in quiescent
   regions of the ocean provides longer term buffering of the CO2 from the
   atmosphere. It has been suggested (Ozaki et al., 1999) that a moving
   injection source would enhance the initial dilution of the CO2 and
   reduce potential environmental impacts associated with high
   concentrations of CO2 near the injection point. We have adapted the
   Mesoscale Ocean Dispersion Model (MODM) to simulate the injection of CO2
   from a moving ship, and compare the resulting dispersion patterns with
   those simulated using a fixed source.},

Title = {Challenges in mainstreaming climate change into productive coastal
   sectors in a Small Island State - The case of Trinidad and Tobago},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {136-142},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {In ratifying the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   (UNFCCC), Trinidad and Tobago gave its commitment to contribute towards
   mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and instituting measures for
   adapting to climate change impacts. Formulation of a National Climate
   Change Policy subsequently took place with a view to providing direction
   towards fulfilling UNFCCC obligations.
   The National Climate Change Policy identified that coastal areas of
   Trinidad and Tobago were particularly vulnerable to climate change
   impacts. As a small island State, the country cannot afford its
   productive sectors operating in and/or reliant upon coastal resources to
   be at risk, even as some contribute to the climate change phenomenon.
   The increasing threat to socio-cultural, economic and environmental
   sustainability posed by climate change, was acknowledged in the Draft
   National Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Policy Framework
   which aims to treat with climate change impacts in the coastal zone and
   reduce vulnerability to associated hazards.
   Given the stated objectives of the National Climate Change Policy and
   the Draft National ICZM Policy Framework, this paper examined the policy
   and plans in place to integrate climate change considerations into
   management for the coastal sectors of fisheries, energy, tourism and
   maritime transport. It found that the mainstreaming of climate change
   mitigation and adaptation responses in these coastal sectors has not
   been as effective as needed. Progress in this regard was constrained by
   human, financial and technical resource availability. Proposed are
   rationalised institutional arrangements which, if statutorily grounded,
   will better allow for achieving co-ordinated climate change mitigation
   and adaptation outcomes in Trinidad and Tobago. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis of Impacts of Future Heat Waves on
   Mortality in the Eastern United States},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {122},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change is anticipated to influence heat-related
   mortality in the future. However, estimates of excess mortality
   attributable to future heat waves are subject to large uncertainties and
   have not been projected under the latest greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios.
   OBJECTIVES: We estimated future heat wave mortality in the eastern
   United States (approximately 1,700 counties) under two Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and investigated sources of uncertainty.
   METHODS: Using dynamically downscaled hourly temperature projections for
   2057-2059, we projected heat wave days that were defined using four heat
   wave metrics and estimated the excess mortality attributable to them. We
   apportioned the sources of uncertainty in excess mortality estimates
   using a variance-decomposition method.
   RESULTS: Estimates suggest that excess mortality attributable to heat
   waves in the eastern United States would result in 200-7,807 deaths/year
   (mean 2,379 deaths/year) in 2057-2059. Average excess mortality
   projections under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were 1,403 and 3,556
   deaths/year, respectively. Excess mortality would be relatively high in
   the southern states and eastern coastal areas (excluding Maine). The
   major sources of uncertainty were the relative risk estimates for
   mortality on heat wave versus non-heat wave days, the RCP scenarios, and
   the heat wave definitions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risks from future heat waves may be an order of
   magnitude higher than the mortality risks reported in 2002-2004, with
   thousands of heat wave-related deaths per year in the study area
   projected under the RCP8.5 scenario. Substantial spatial variability in
   county-level heat mortality estimates suggests that effective mitigation
   and adaptation measures should be developed based on spatially resolved
   data.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Paddy fields are considered as one of the most important sources of
   anthropogenic methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. While
   several technical options have been proposed to reduce these emissions,
   gaps in data and information based on application of these options in
   the field are a key barrier to scaling-up. To address these gaps, we
   conducted a review of literature to analyze the potential of technical
   options in Southeast Asia (SEA). Using screening criteria based on
   reliability of experimental data, 31 region-specific cases were selected
   for the analysis. A meta-analysis indicated that water management
   options, including single and multiple drainage approaches such as
   alternative wetting and drying (AWD), significantly reduced CH4
   emissions by 35\% as a mean effect size (95\% confidential interval:
   41-29\%), as well as the combined effects of CH4+N2O (net GWP) by 29\%
   (36-23\%). The effect on reducing CH4 emissions in the dry season was
   significantly larger than that in the wet season. Application of biochar
   reduced both CH4 and N2O emissions by 20\% (40\% to -7\%), while
   significantly increased rice yield by 28\% (8-52\%). Other options such
   as removal of rice straw from the previous crop, composting rice straw
   and manure, application of sulfate-containing fertilizer, and soil
   drying in the fallow season also have recognized potential to reduce
   emissions but require further data and consideration of possible
   trade-offs. Based on the analysis of mitigation potential, promising
   technical options were assessed by considering together with constraints
   and additional co-benefits in order to provide a useful guide for policy
   makers and rice value chain operators in SEA countries for adopting
   mitigation options in rice cultivation to tackle climate change and
   enhance agriculture sector sustainability.},

Title = {Accounting for farm diversity in Life Cycle Assessment studies - the
   case of poultry production in a tropical island},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {280-292},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The farm is the most influential stage of agricultural production
   because farming practices affect both pre-farm and on-farm environmental
   impacts. Since farm diversity is not usually taken into consideration,
   it is legitimate to question the interest of including it in Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) studies. This work explores several approaches to
   modelling the farm stage when assessing the environmental impact of an
   agricultural supply chain in a context with variable farm performances.
   A LCA of a poultry supply chain was applied from
   cradle-to-slaughterhouse gate. The first approach is a classical one in
   which farm diversity is not taken into account and an average farm is
   constructed on the basis of weighted average farm characteristics. The
   second approach distinguishes four farm types identified by cluster
   analysis, and four LCA were performed according to these farm types.
   Farm types were distinguished based on their consumption of inputs and
   the type of ventilation of the farm buildings. Results indicate that the
   classical approach is sufficient to highlight problem hotspots and to
   identify promising mitigation measures. Reducing the transport distance
   of imported maize, improving feed conversion efficiency and anaerobic
   digestion of slaughterhouse animal wastes were identified as appropriate
   mitigation measures. As feed production and poultry rearing are the
   stages with the most impact, distinguishing farm types provides i)
   insight into farm functioning to better explain the variability of
   environmental impacts and understand how to reduce them, ii) reduce the
   uncertainty of results, and iii) provide appropriate recommendations for
   mitigation measures. Coupling a farm typology with the LCA is
   particularly useful when farming systems are very diverse like in
   Reunion Island where the climate varies considerably across the island.

Title = {Mitigating uncertainty and enhancing resilience to climate change in the
   fisheries sector in Taiwan: Policy implications for food security},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {355-372},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The human population is projected to grow to more than 9 billion by
   2050. New farming and fishing techniques are continually being
   developed. However, food production remains restricted by the finiteness
   of natural resources and the rapid increase in the global population. In
   the future, food production may decline because of the aggravated
   effects of climate change. Food production will be unable to satisfy the
   demands of the global population, leading to a food security crisis. As
   the world population continues to increase, food shortages will become
   increasingly severe, particularly for regions located in ``climate
   impact hot spots{''} in tropical and subtropical zones and for
   small-island countries such as Taiwan. In the present study, supply and
   demand are analysed to examine the risks and uncertainties associated
   with the impact of climate change on the domestic and imported seafood
   supply. First, we conduct a literature review to identify the climate
   risk for sea food security, and then, we analyse the domestic production
   of both the marine fishing catch and aquaculture. This study also
   examines the critical problems of the imported seafood supply and
   applies a comparative analysis of impact type and differences in the top
   10 seafood import countries to organize adaptation strategies to climate
   change. Moreover, due to the type of climate impact and the differences
   between long-term climate impact and extreme climate impact, we collect
   and compile the existing climate adaptation strategies of fishery
   production, seafood importing, and the demand and supply of seafood in
   Taiwan. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis to seek any
   deficiencies in the existing climate adaptation strategies and offer new
   adaptation guidelines based on the existing climate adaptation
   strategies. The results show that Taiwan's major adaptation strategies
   have been precautionary mitigation measures. In terms of resilience
   management, only the buffer stock scheme plan and the stabilization
   funds method are selected for some specific species to mitigate the
   short-term fluctuation in both yield and price for imported domestic
   seafood. However, we will confront uncertainties stemming from global
   climate change in the future; the existing climate adaptation strategies
   of Taiwan are still not sufficient to respond to climate impacts. For
   example, the climate change early warning system is still very
   inadequate, the existing scientific knowledge is insufficient, and the
   current adaptation strategies are insufficient for resolving the
   fluctuations in the market mechanism of seafood. According to the
   principles of risk management, the adaptation strategies recommended in
   this study can be differentiated into two categories: precautionary
   mitigation measures can be used to adapt to domestic production and
   uncertainties; such measures include avoidance, transfer, and reduction
   to prevent the frequency and consequences of climate change for building
   a resilient fisheries sector. Moreover, resilience management (e.g.,
   risk retention) can be used to respond to uncertainties in supply for
   adjusting production and mitigating the risks of climate change. (C)

Title = {The coral conservation crisis: interacting local and global stressors
   reduce reef resiliency and create challenges for conservation solutions},
Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are one of the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems in
   the world. Humans rely on these coral reef ecosystems to provide
   significant ecological and economic resources; however, coral reefs are
   threatened by numerous local and global anthropogenic factors that cause
   significant environmental change. The interactions of these local and
   global human impacts may increase the rate of coral reef degradation.
   For example, there are many local influences (i.e., sedimentation and
   submarine groundwater discharge) that may exacerbate coral bleaching and
   mortality. Therefore, researchers and resource managers cannot limit
   their narratives and actions to mitigating a sole stressor. With the
   continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, management strategies
   and restoration techniques need to account for the scale at which
   environmental change occurs. This review aims to outline the various
   local and global anthropogenic stressors threatening reef resiliency and
   address the recent disagreements surrounding present-day conservation
   practices. Unfortunately, there is no one solution to preserve and
   restore all coral reefs. Each coral reef region is challenged by
   numerous interactive stressors that affect its ecosystem response,
   recovery, and services in various ways. This review discusses, while
   global reef degradation occurs, local solutions should be implemented to
   efficiently protect the coral reef ecosystem services that are valuable
   to marine and terrestrial environments.},

Abstract = {Extreme rainfall events have a negative effect on the coastal area of
   Jiadung Township in Pingtung County, Taiwan, which experiences critical
   land subsidence. Local stakeholders have developed various measures for
   coping with flooding impacts according to past experience. These
   adaptive measures not only involve managing the impact of heavy rainfall
   but also resisting the disastrous effects of land subsidence. However,
   in 2009, Typhoon Morakot caused multiple days of intense rainfall and
   nearly rendered ineffective the adaptive measures employed to prevent
   damage. Stakeholders adopt diverse measures according to different needs
   and vulnerabilities. Consequently, some adaptive measures are likely to
   cause an increase in the vulnerability of different sectors and induce
   additional socioeconomic impacts. This paper presents the results of a
   semistructured questionnaire and field survey conducted for analyzing
   the adaptive measures adopted by local stakeholders before and after
   Typhoon Morakot. According to the routes and pathways of maladaptation
   in the Jiadung coastal area, this study analyzed the main adaptive
   measures and functions as well as identified the entities affected by
   maladaptation. Furthermore, this study emphasizes a bottom-up viewpoint
   for adaptation policy decision makers.},

Volume = {789},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {occurring wildfires, such as New England and the Great Lakes, are
   projected to experience a doubling of occurrence probabilities by 2100
   under RCP 8.5. This high resolution, continental-scale modeling study of
   climate change impacts on potential fire probability accounts for
   shifting background environmental conditions across regions that will
   interact with topographic drivers to significantly alter future fire
   probabilities. The ensemble modeling approach presents a useful planning
   tool for mitigation and adaptation strategies in regions of increasing
   wildfire risk. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

   Globally increasing wildfires have been attributed to anthropogenic
   climate change. However, providing decision makers with a clear
   understanding of how future planetary warming could affect fire regimes
   is complicated by confounding land use factors that influence wildfire
   and by uncertainty associated with model simulations of climate change.
   We use an ensemble of statistically downscaled Global Climate Models in
   combination with the Physical Chemistry Fire Frequency Model (PC2FM) to
   project changing potential fire probabilities in the conterminous United
   States for two scenarios representing lower (RCP 4.5) and higher (RCP
   8.5) greenhouse gas emission futures. PC2FM is a physically-based and
   scale-independent model that predicts mean fire return intervals from
   both fire reactant and reaction variables, which are largely dependent
   on a locale's climate. Our results overwhelmingly depict increasing
   potential fire probabilities across the conterminous US for both climate
   scenarios. The primary mechanism for the projected increases is rising
   temperatures, reflecting changes in the chemical reaction environment
   commensurate with enhanced photosynthetic rates and available thermal
   molecular energy. Existing high risk areas, such as the Cascade Range
   and the Coastal California Mountains, are projected to experience
   greater annual fire occurrence probabilities, with relative increases of
   122\% and 67\%, respectively, under RCP 8.5 compared to increases of
   63\% and 38\% under RCP 4.5. Regions not currently associated with

Title = {The value of early methane mitigation in preserving Arctic summer sea
   ice},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {A growing body of literature has identified methane mitigation as a key
   component of limiting the rate and extent of global warming. However,
   little is known about how methane mitigation can benefit other critical
   aspects of the climate system. This study explores the value of early
   methane mitigation in addition to carbon dioxide mitigation in helping
   avert an approaching and concerning climate event: the near-complete
   loss of Arctic summer sea ice. While drastic cuts in carbon dioxide
   emissions will ultimately control the fate of Arctic summer sea ice, we
   show that simultaneous early deployment of feasible methane mitigation
   measures is essential to avoiding the loss of Arctic summer sea ice this
   century. In fact, the benefit of combined methane and carbon dioxide
   mitigation on reducing the likelihood of a seasonally ice-free Arctic
   can be greater than the simple sum of benefits from two independent
   greenhouse gas policies. The extent to which methane mitigation can help
   preserve Arctic summer sea ice depends on the implementation timeline.
   The benefit of methane mitigation is maximized when all technically
   feasible measures are implemented within this decade, and it decreases
   with each decade of delay in implementation due to its influence on
   end-of-century temperature. A key insight is that methane mitigation
   substantially lowers the risk of losing Arctic summer sea ice across
   varying levels of concomitant carbon dioxide mitigation. This analysis
   provides further evidence of the value of early methane mitigation and
   the need to consider its benefits beyond reduced global temperature and
   improved air quality.},

Abstract = {While climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are the
   world's most prominent issue today, Lebanon, the Southern Mediterranean
   country, is trying to develop an integrated plan for urban development
   energy supply, and environmental management. For years, the central
   authority in Lebanon has been unable to provide a steady production and
   distribution of electrical energy or even invest in the existing
   renewable resources. This has lead local authorities, or municipalities,
   to design their own plans despite the lack of accurate data and the
   absence of supporting measures initiated by the State. In the framework
   of the Covenant of Meyors (CoM) applications in the South Mediterranean
   region through the CES-MED program, it has been noticed that several
   Lebanese applicants wish to commit to the Covenant but are obstructed by
   many barriers which we shall highlight and evaluate in this paper. The
   paper also presents a complete case study of the Union of Municipalities
   of Shouf-Soueijany encompassing eight different municipalities. The case
   study establishes that the calculation of the total amount of greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions resulting from the overall energy consumption of the
   8 municipalities (the Baseline Emission Inventory or BEI) will enable
   the union w comply with the CoM through the implementation of a
   Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). In order to identify the nature
   of the entities emitting CO2 in the scope of the municipal union, we
   have resorted to onsite data collection. The unavailability of official
   reliable statistics and references has made data collection and the
   determination of a baseline year a significant obstacle to the research.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change and variability has recently become a
   subject of increasing importance in climate change research with an
   objective to reduce the vulnerability of climate sensitive people. The
   present study was designed to identify and assess the adaptation
   strategies followed by the climate sensitive livestock rearers of
   coastal Odisha and West Bengal. Livestock rearers (480) were selected
   from 4 coastal districts of Odisha and West Bengal. The study revealed
   that 17 adaptation strategies were followed by the livestock rearer. To
   trace the relative importance among the adaptation strategies, an
   exclusively climate change adaptation index was developed. It was
   observed that change in micro-climate in cattle shed/grazing area/stall
   was the most preferred adaptation strategy followed by providing the
   frequent clean and fresh drinking water and additional
   washing/sprinkling of cattle and buffaloes. Livestocks are very much
   susceptible to heat stress. Therefore, most of the livestock rearers
   followed heat alleviating adaptation strategies.},

   emissions reduction. While the issue of permanence is most commonly
   associated with a `leaky' carbon sequestration reservoir, we argue that
   this is an issue that applies to just about all carbon mitigation
   options. The appropriate formulation of this problem is to ask `what is
   the value of temporary storage?' Valuing temporary storage can be
   represented as a familiar economic problem, with explicitly stated
   assumptions about carbon prices and the discount rate. To illustrate the
   methodology, we calculate the sequestration effectiveness for injecting
   CO2 at various depths in the ocean. Analysis is performed for three
   limiting carbon price assumptions: constant carbon prices ( assumes
   constant marginal damages), carbon prices rise at the discount rate (
   assumes efficient allocation of a cumulative emissions cap without a
   backstop technology), and carbon prices first rise at the discount rate
   but become constant after a given time ( assumes introduction of a
   backstop technology). Our results show that the value of relatively deep
   ocean carbon sequestration can be nearly equivalent to permanent
   sequestration if marginal damages ( i.e., carbon prices) remain constant
   or if there is a backstop technology that caps the abatement cost in the
   not too distant future. On the other hand, if climate damages are such
   as to require a fixed cumulative emissions limit and there is no
   backstop, then a storage option with even very slow leakage has limited
   value relative to a permanent storage option.},

   world's oceans},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {837},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The global issues of climate change and marine litter are interlinked
   and understanding these connections is key to managing their combined
   risks to marine biodiversity and ultimately society. For example, fossil
   fuel-based plastics cause direct emissions of greenhouse gases and
   therefore are an important contributing factor to climate change, while
   other impacts of plastics can manifest as alterations in key species and
   habitats in coastal and marine environments. Marine litter is
   acknowledged as a threat multiplier that acts with other stressors such
   as climate change to cause far greater damage than if they occurred in
   isolation. On the other hand, while climate change can lead to increased
   inputs of litter into the marine environment, the presence of marine
   litter can also undermine the climate resilience of marine ecosystems.
   There is increasing evidence that that climate change and marine litter
   are inextricably linked, although these interactions and the resulting
   effects vary widely across oceanic regions and depend on the particular
   characteristics of specific marine environments. Ecosystem resilience
   approaches, that integrate climate change with other local stressors,
   offer a suitable framework to incorporate the consideration of marine
   litter where that is deemed to be a risk, and to steer, coordinate and
   prioritise research and monitoring, as well as management, policy,
   planning and action to effectively tackle the combined risks and impacts
   from climate change and marine litter.},

Abstract = {Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are an important tool to compare the
   costs and benefits of different climate policies. Recently, attention
   has been given to the effect of different discounting methods and damage
   estimates on the results of IAMs. One aspect to which little attention
   has been paid is how the representation of the climate system may affect
   the estimated benefits of mitigation action. In that respect, we analyse
   several well-known IAMs, including the newest versions of FUND, DICE and
   PAGE. Given the role of IAMs in integrating information from different
   disciplines, they should ideally represent both best estimates and the
   ranges of anticipated climate system and carbon cycle behaviour (as e.g.
   synthesised in the IPCC Assessment reports). We show that in the longer
   term, beyond 2100, most IAM parameterisations of the carbon cycle imply
   lower CO2 concentrations compared to a model that captures IPCC AR4
   knowledge more closely, e.g. the carbon-cycle climate model MAGICC6.
   With regard to the climate component, some IAMs lead to much lower
   benefits of mitigation than MAGICC6. The most important reason for the
   underestimation of the benefits of mitigation is the failure in
   capturing climate dynamics correctly, which implies this could be a
   potential development area to focus on.},

Title = {Converting beach-cast seagrass wrack into biochar: A climate-friendly
   solution to a coastal problem},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Excessive accumulation of plant `wrack' on beaches as a result of
   coastal development and beach modification (e.g. groin installation) is
   a global problem. This study investigated the potential for converting
   beach-cast seagrass wrack into biochar as a `climate-friendly' disposal
   option for resource managers. Wrack samples from 11 seagrass species
   around Australia were initially screened for their biochar potential
   using pyrolysis techniques, and then two species - Posidonia australis
   and Zostera muelleri - underwent detailed analyses. Both species had
   high levels of refractory materials and high conversion efficiency
   (48-57\%) of plant carbon into biochar carbon, which is comparable to
   high-quality terrestrial biochar products. P. australis wrack gave
   higher biochar yields than Z muelleri consistent with its higher initial
   carbon content According to C-13 NMR, wrack predominantly comprised
   carbohydrates, protein, and lignin. Aryl carbon typical of pyrogenic
   materials dominated the spectrum of the thermally-altered organic
   materials. Overall, this study provides the first data on the
   feasibility of generating biochar from seagrass wrack, showing that
   biocharring offers a promising climate-friendly alternative to disposal
   of beach wrack in landfill by avoiding a portion of the greenhouse gas
   emissions that would otherwise occur if wrack was left to decompose.

Abstract = {Bioclimatology plays a key role in the mitigation of climatic impacts on
   animal production. In and and semi-arid regions, high ambient
   temperature accompanied with scarcity of water affects significantly
   animal production to be about 2-4\% of world meat, milk and egg
   production. General circulation models (GCMs) of climatic changes
   indicate that rising levels of greenhouse gases are likely to increase
   the global average surface temperature by 1.5-4.5 C over the next 100
   years, raise sea-levels, amplify extreme weather events such as storms
   and hot spells, shift climate zones poleward, and reduce soil moisture.
   Farm animals will be affected directly and indirectly by these climatic
   changes resulting in a substantial reduction in meat, milk and egg
   production. Study of animal adaptation mechanisms and managerial
   techniques to alleviate the effect of extreme climates and climatic
   changes on animal will help in mitigation of climatic impacts on animal
   production. The aim is to discuss the bioclimatic factors causing
   necessity of farm animal adaptation as well as adaptive mechanisms to
   mitigate the impacts of climate on animal performance to overcome the
   gap between human demands and animal production.},

Abstract = {Considering the growing threats of climate change, in addition to
   mitigation strategies, it is highly and equally critical to understand
   the socio-economic determinants of climate adaptation in order to
   develop climate adaptation policies. This study makes a first attempt to
   explore the determinants of adaptation to climate change and choices of
   adaptation strategies at a larger spatial scale of the south-west
   coastal areas in Bangladesh, which is one of the most climate-vulnerable
   regions in the world. We employ both qualitative and quantitative
   approaches in order to examine farmers' perception of climate risks,
   determinants and choices of adaptation strategies to climate change in
   six coastal districts of Bangladesh. Farmers are adapting to these
   situations using their knowledge and experience. The study reveals that
   a number of adaptation strategies have been taken to reduce the negative
   impacts of climate change. These adaptation strategies are categorized
   into four groups: crop management, water management, land management,
   and income diversification. Availability of inputs, high production
   cost, agricultural extension service, and proper adaptation knowledge
   and experiences were noted as the main non-climatic challenges, as well
   as different climatic factors in agricultural adaptation strategies.
   Statistical analysis indicates that the different socio-economic
   determinants of farmers significantly influence their choices of
   adaptation to climate change. Farmers adopt these adaptations mostly
   autonomously rather than on the advice of government. This study could
   be useful for developing national adaptation policies in Bangladesh and
   other similar developing countries.},

Abstract = {Cities are vulnerable to flooding and historical events, for instance
   Hurricane Sandy in 2012, have showed that losses in the cities are
   costly. In the context of climate change and socio-economic development,
   future flood risk will inevitably rise; adaptive measures, for instance
   upgrading of sea dikes and floodwalls, improving drainage systems and
   implementing green infrastructures, are proposed under the changing
   environment in the cities. A question of when to implement what measures
   in the cities over time is then brought up. The approach of dynamic
   adaptive policy pathways is applied to formulate adaptation pathways for
   a case study of Shanghai to explore the optimal investment strategy in
   context of deep uncertainties. Adaptation concept is not only aiming to
   achieve optimal strategy but also to determine when to implement the
   measures. The adaptation pathways for three types of floods (coastal
   flood, river flood and pluvial flood) in Shanghai were formulated
   through a preliminary qualitative analysis. This could provide an
   insight to the long-term feasibility of adaptive flood risk strategies.
   This research could provide a rational indication for policy/decision
   makers on future adaptation strategy at the city scale.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the key aspects of the recent Coastal Plan of the
   Veneto Region (IT). Its aim is to propose a single mitigation strategy
   for coastal erosion that is valid for the whole Veneto Region, and
   possibly elsewhere, as well as a method to assign a priority level to
   any action. The suggested mitigation action against erosion depends on
   urbanization level, beach width, as well as cross-shore and long-shore
   sediment transport. The criterion used to give a priority level to
   mitigation actions is based on a vulnerability index that takes into
   account erosive tendency, existing coastal flooding hazards, coast
   value, environmental relevance, tourist pressure, urbanization level,
   the presence of production activities, and cultural heritage. A sample
   case featuring the littoral of Rosolina is also provided and includes a
   site description, the sediment budget, critical issues and possible
   mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Commercial fishing is an important socio-economic activity in coastal
   regions of the UK and Ireland. Oceanatmospheric changes caused by
   greenhouse gas emissions are likely to affect future fish and shellfish
   production, and lead to increasing challenges in ensuring long-term
   sustainable fisheries management. The paper reviews existing knowledge
   and understanding of the exposure of marine ecosystems to
   ocean-atmospheric changes, the consequences of these changes for marine
   fisheries in the UK and Ireland, and the adaptability of the UK and
   Irish fisheries sector. Ocean warming is resulting in shifts in the
   distribution of exploited species and is affecting the productivity of
   fish stocks and underlying marine ecosystems. In addition, some studies
   suggest that ocean acidification may have large potential impacts on
   fisheries resources, in particular shell-forming invertebrates. These
   changes may lead to loss of productivity, but also the opening of new
   fishing opportunities, depending on the interactions between climate
   impacts, fishing grounds and fleet types. They will also affect fishing
   regulations, the price of fish products and operating costs, which in
   turn will affect the economic performance of the UK and Irish fleets.
   Key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the implications of
   climate and ocean chemistry changes for marine fisheries in the UK and
   Ireland, particularly on the social and economic responses of the
   fishing sectors to climate change. However, these gaps should not delay
   climate change mitigation and adaptation policy actions, particularly
   those measures that clearly have other co-benefits. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {Mangrove forest in the context of climate change belongs to the LULUCF
   (land use, land use change and forestry) sector is one of the important
   sectors to be included in the inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. Mangrove forest plays an important role in the carbon cycle.
   The present study analyzes the perspective of local wisdom of Jaring
   Halus Village communities on the existence of mangrove forest and to
   describe the land-use and land-cover changes between 2006 and 2012 of
   Jaring Halus Village, Langkat, North Sumatra, Indonesia and their
   implications to carbon dioxide emissions. The results showed that
   community knowledge on the general role of mangrove and coastal
   protection was 85.5\% and 71.4\%, respectively. Furthermore, 92.8\% of
   the perspective of community was depicted that mangrove forests were
   greatly impacted to their lives, indicated that local wisdom contributed
   to maintaining the existence of mangrove forest in the village. A
   land-use change matrix demonstrated that there was very small increase
   from 2006 to 2012 in the land-use of secondary mangrove forest (0.0033
   ha). The net cumulative of carbon emissions in Jaring Halus Village
   during 2006-2012 was -5.58 t CO2-eq/year, whereas predicting future
   emissions in 2016 was -16.74 t CO2-eq/year, suggesting carbon
   sequestration occurred in the mangrove forest. Mitigation actions were
   performed to increase carbon sequestration such as establishing nursery
   and planted after 3-6 months germinated, rehabilitation of degraded
   area, and unwritten rules concerning with the utility and cutting of
   mangrove trees with approval of village authority.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rising seas, more frequent storms and other climate-driven coastal
   hazards necessitate adaptation planning measures to protect people and
   property. To date, coastal vulnerability assessments have prioritized
   the most exposed areas of coastline, but there is a gap between
   recognized climate science and the feasibility or suitability
   considerations relevant for implementing coastal adaptation
   strategies-including legal, policy, financial, or engineered
   approaches-to address coastal threats. This paper sets forth a
   methodology for bridging the gap between climate science, law and
   coastal adaptation policies. This methodology seeks to connect spatial
   analysis methods with attributes of coastal adaptation strategies that
   make them inherently place-based-ranging from engineered solutions, to
   legal strategies and financial tools-to determine where they are legally
   feasible and suitable. Both spatial and non-spatial limiting and
   enabling conditions of coastal adaptation policies drive these
   determinations. The methodology integrates a spatial framework using
   feasibility statements derived by 1) coupling these conditions and
   features with spatial information (e.g., zoning, land use/land cover,
   geomorphologic features), and 2) identifying suitability conditions
   through synthesizing policy considerations for each coastal adaptation
   strategy.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses integrated approaches to the management of risks
   related to extreme weather and climate change. This is done with the
   Loss and Damage (L\&D) mechanism of the UNFCCC in mind. Relevant
   insights are provided for climate policy negotiators and policymakers on
   how risk management and adaptation interact with L\&D solutions, and
   vice versa, on how L\&D-related activities can support risk reduction
   and adaptation in vulnerable countries. Particular attention is devoted
   to how risk management can help society confront the impacts of weather
   disasters in relation to anthropogenic climate change. A holistic view
   of risk management is presented by discussing: the state-of-the art of
   risk assessment methods; (cost-benefit) evaluations of risk management
   options; household-scale risk reduction strategies; insurance schemes
   for residual risk and their relations with risk reduction; and the
   design of adaptation pathways to cope with uncertain timing and
   intensity of climate change impacts. Each topic is illustrated with
   concrete case studies. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the links
   between disaster risk management, climate adaptation and the L\&D
   mechanism.},

Title = {Comparative analysis of adaptation strategies for coastal climate change
   in North West Europe},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change has experienced a recent rapid increase in
   guides, manuals and strategies, including the EU adaptation strategy of
   2013. However, minimal critical review or evaluation has been done on
   the process and outcomes of adaptation strategies. This work presents a
   comparative analysis of progress towards adaptation strategies in nine
   coastal areas in NW Europe (from Belgium, France, Ireland and UK) where
   the INTERREG IVb IMCORE project was implemented. Adaptation progress was
   evaluated using a suite of indicators in six categories: Relevance,
   Effectiveness, Efficiency, Results \& Impact, Sustainability and
   Management. Data were obtained through a combination of questionnaires
   and interviews. Although a similar IMCORE adaptation process was
   implemented there were notable differences between areas. Two alternate
   modes of implementation were identified: one focused more on impact and
   results and one on institutionalisation and future security of the
   adaptation process. The length of history of collaborative working was
   positively associated with progress in adaptation planning. The results
   thus recommend creation of a base for collaborative working prior to
   undertaking an adaptation initiative. However, this contrasts with the
   EU approach for developing adaptation strategies in which seeking
   agreement with stakeholders responsible for implementation is the
   penultimate stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) present a promising solution to
   mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but on the other hand, their increased
   penetration can impact power system operation, particularly so in an
   isolated microgrid. Similarly, demand response (DR) has the potential to
   provide significant flexibility in the operation of an isolated
   microgrid with limited generation capacity, by altering the demand and
   introducing an elasticity effect. This paper proposes a new mathematical
   model for optimal scheduling of energy resources and smart management of
   loads which includes smart charging of PEVs, DR, and operation of
   battery energy storage systems (BESSs), for isolated microgrids.
   Different case studies are developed to examine isolated microgrid
   operations when the demand increases, and how the energy management
   model copes with such increase. The proposed model develops energy
   management strategies considering the network constraints and different
   objective functions from the perspective of the microgrid operator as
   well as from the owners of PEVs and BESS.},

Volume = {128},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {381-393},

Abstract = {Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for addressing
   the impacts of climate change, yet are often considered separately. This
   paper examines the literature for evidence of the interactions of
   adaptation and mitigation measures across the agriculture, biodiversity,
   coasts, forests, urban and water sectors, focusing on Europe. It found
   that often adaptation and mitigation synergies and conflicts were not
   explicitly mentioned within a sector, let alone between sectors. Most
   measures, however, were found to have an effect on another sector,
   resulting in neutral, positive (synergies) or negative (conflicts)
   interactions within and between sectors. Many positive cross-sectoral
   interactions involved biodiversity or water and thus these could
   represent good starting places for the implementation of integrated,
   cross-sectoral strategies. Previous studies suggest that adaptation and
   mitigation are undertaken on different time and geographical scales;
   this study found many local scale measures which could facilitate
   integration between both adaptation and mitigation. It is important that
   cross-sectoral interaction of adaptation and mitigation measures are
   explicitly recognised if they are to be mainstreamed into policy, so
   that positive outcomes are enhanced and unintended consequences avoided.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on the municipal water management system in
   the Kingdom of Bahrain: Vulnerability assessment and adaptation options},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {95-110},
Abstract = {An assessment of the vulnerability of the municipal water management
   system to the impacts of climate change in the Kingdom of Bahrain,
   manifested by the increase in demands due to increase in temperatures,
   is conducted using a dynamic mathematical model representing the water
   sector in the kingdom. The model is developed using WEAP software and
   was calibrated and validated by historical matching utilizing data for
   the period 2000-2012. The model is used in the evaluation of the
   municipal water sector performance in terms of municipal water demands
   and their associated cost without and with climate change impacts
   scenarios for the period 2012-2030. The impact of climate change on the
   municipal water system is quantified as the difference between the two
   scenarios in three selected cost indicators: financial (production,
   conveyance and distribution costs), economic (natural gas asset
   consumption by desalination plants), and environmental (CO2 emissions by
   desalination plants). The vulnerability assessment indicated that the
   current municipal water management system in Bahrain is generally
   inefficient and associated with relatively high costs, which are
   expected to increase with time under the current policies and management
   approach focusing on supply-side management. The increase in temperature
   will increase these already high costs, and would exacerbate the water
   management challenges in Bahrain. However, these mounting challenges
   also present an opportune moment for Bahrain to review its current water
   resources management approaches and practices and to integrate climate
   change adaptation measures into its water planning and policies. In
   order to build an adaptive management capacity of the municipal water
   management system in Bahrain, a number of management interventions are
   proposed and evaluated, individually and combined, for their
   effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of the management system using
   the developed dynamic model. These are: reduction of the leakage
   percentage in the municipal water distributions network and reducing per
   capita water consumption by raising water awareness among consumers and
   installing water saving devices in residential units. The evaluation
   results indicate that there is a large potential for reducing the
   municipal water demand and its associated cost, especially when all the
   three are combined; by the year 2030 it is estimated that the cumulative
   financial saving would be about US\$ 2.9 Billion, the cumulative
   reduction in CO2 emission would be about 19.7 Million tons, and the
   preservation of the kingdom's limited natural gas reserves would be
   about 4 Billion m(3). In addition, a major reduction in desalination
   brine discharge to the marine environment and reduction of generated
   wastewater and their associated collection and treatment cost could be
   achieved from the implementation of these interventions. Adopting such
   management interventions will not only enhance the efficiency of the
   municipal water management system, but it will also help the Kingdom in
   its efforts in reducing its greenhouse gasses emissions. It is
   recommended that similar climate change vulnerability and adaptation
   analysis is extended to the whole water sector in Bahrain to include
   other major water consuming sectors (i.e., agricultural, industrial, and
   tourism sectors) and their sources of water (i.e., groundwater and
   wastewater) in Bahrain.},

   infrastructure, whereas soft adaptive measures prioritize natural
   capital, community control, simplicity and appropriateness. The
   prevalence of these two types of adaptation pathways is illustrated
   through two case studies from the Maldives: The Safer Island Development
   Program and the Integrating Climate Change Risks Program. Policymakers
   must be aware that hard and soft adaptation measures may trade off with
   each other, and give both paths due consideration.},

Abstract = {With the increasing awareness of the risks and impacts of climate
   change, scholars tend to pay more attention to the applications of
   indicators, which access the effectiveness of climate change adaptation.
   This study aims to evaluate the overall progress of climate change
   adaptation in China during 2010-2018 in a quantitative manner. The Index
   for Climate Change Adaptation in China (ICCAC) has been thus developed
   by adopting the analytic hierarchy process weighting and expert scoring
   method. Namely, ICCAC is composed of national climate change impacts,
   adaptation actions in key sectors, adaptation progress in key sectors,
   and the national adaptation policy framework. Overall, the ICCAC and its
   four sub-indexes increased significantly from 2010 to 2018, on a
   yearly-basis. Each sub-index implied that the socio-economic impacts
   caused by climate change in China have been alleviated gradually;
   specifically, the mainstream endeavor of key sectors has witnessed
   remarkable progress, however, it is worth noting that the gap between
   individual adaptation actions and policies still exists; the
   implementation effect of policies in key sectors is not as affluent as
   that of actions; the current adaptation endeavor in key areas is still
   closely related to the mainstream business of corresponding competent
   ministries rather than adaptation-aimed actions; the national adaptation
   policy framework has been primarily formed, but there are still some
   deficiencies. As a result, the gap in China's adaptation process could
   be mainly manifested in the following five aspects: i) adaptation
   effectiveness assessment in forestry and urban infrastructure is
   urgently needed; ii) policies in marine and water resources sectors need
   structural reforms; iii) evaluation criteria for national adaptation are
   not necessarily sufficient; iv) the improvement of adaptive management
   efficiency has stagnated recently; and v) the adaptation works of
   relevant Ministries should be coordinated and put forward the
   corresponding strategies. Finally, this study presents four proposals:
   conducting an evaluation of adaptation actions in all key sectors,
   integrating climate change impacts into sectoral planning decisions,
   launching concrete action plans for adaptation, establishing a complete
   policy framework on adaptation.},

Abstract = {Tropical Pacific climate varies at interannual, decadal and centennial
   time scales, and exerts a significant influence on global climate.
   Climate model projections exhibit a large spread in the magnitude and
   pattern of tropical Pacific warming in response to greenhouse-gas
   forcing. Here, we show that part of this spread can be explained by
   model biases in the simulation of interannual variability, namely the El
   Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. We show that models that
   exhibit strong ENSO nonlinearities simulate a more accurate balance of
   ENSO feedbacks, and their projected tropical Pacific sea surface
   temperature warming pattern is closely linked to their projected ENSO
   response. Within this group, models with ENSO nonlinearity close to
   observed project stronger warming of the cold tongue, whereas models
   with stronger than observed ENSO nonlinearity project a more uniform
   warming of the tropical Pacific. These differences are also manifest in
   the projected changes of precipitation patterns, thereby highlighting
   that ENSO simulation biases may lead to potentially biased projections
   in long-term precipitation trends, with great significance for regional
   climate adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {The inability of world governments to agree on and implement effective
   mitigation response policy for anthropogenic climate change has resulted
   in the continuation of an exponential growth in greenhouse gas emissions
   (GHGs) that averages 3.1 per cent per year since 1870. With the
   exception of 2009, world GHG emission levels surpassed the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2000) worst case
   scenario every year since 2004. Because of increasing temperatures due
   to GHG emissions a suite of amplifying feedback mechanisms, such as
   massive methane leaks from the sub-sea Arctic Ocean, have engaged and
   are probably unstoppable. These processes, acting in concert with the
   biological and physical inertia of the Earth system in responding to
   atmospheric loading of GHGs, along with economic, political and social
   barriers to emission reduction, currently place Earth's climate
   trajectory well within the IPCC's A1FI future climate change scenario.
   There is a rapidly diminishing chance of altering this trajectory as
   time goes on. There is also now a very real risk of sudden climate
   change. The pace of this quickly advancing situation, along with our
   scientific understanding of it, has substantially outstripped policy
   discussion. This article examines current primary science literature and
   data on today's climate condition in a policy relevant context. Policy
   Implications center dot An all out shift to a broad range of adaptive
   response policies is urgently needed. Climate change will force
   reevaluations of present day governance agreements on trade, finance,
   food supply, security, development, environment, and similar sectors.
   center dot Easy to understand scientific data driven visualizations and
   culturally appropriate interpretations of probable future conditions are
   needed to facilitate realistic adaptive policy responses from all levels
   of governance. center dot Multilateral policies for an international
   crop seed cooperative could significantly lessen the impacts of crop
   failures and low yields, reducing the risk of famine and economic
   effects of unstable food prices. There is a need to store a large enough
   volume of crop seed varieties to allow for quick switching of varieties
   one year to the next based on dynamic forecasts of seasonal climates.
   center dot Harmonization of international, national, subnational, and
   local policies for the orderly resettlement of coastal populations
   should begin now. This will become a chronic condition involving very
   large numbers of people. Improved and coordinated policies are needed
   for refugee services and related issues of migration and integration as
   well as planning for land use change and infrastructure development.},

Title = {The Implications of Local Perceptions, Knowledge, and Adaptive
   Strategies for Adaptation Planning in Coastal Communities of Zanzibar},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {112-118},

Abstract = {The benefits of community-based adaptation (CBA) both as a means and as
   an end in itself have been well documented in literature. A key
   component and outcome of CBA is the understanding of local perceptions
   and knowledge of climate change, as well as local adaptive strategies.
   This article seeks to understand local perceptions, knowledge, and
   adaptive strategies in three coastal communities in Zanzibar, whose
   economy is heavily dependent on climate-sensitive sectors, with the aim
   to draw implications for adaptation planning. It argues that a good
   understanding of local perceptions, knowledge, and adaptive strategies
   increases effectiveness of adaptation planning. Field observations,
   semistructured interviews, and focus group discussions with community
   representatives revealed a plethora of environmental and social changes
   perceived to be brought about by climate change or anthropogenic
   activities as a result of climate change. All these changes have
   significantly affected various livelihoods in agriculture, fisheries,
   livestock keeping, and tourism. Against the backdrop of these tangible
   and in some cases severe impacts, the authors found that local
   perceptions, knowledge, and adaptation strategies can enable adaptation
   planning to (1) be sensitive to existing and potential conflicts over
   land and livelihoods; (2) take an integrated approach, by informing
   mainstreaming and coordination efforts and uncovering incompatibility of
   options; and (3) strengthen horizontal and vertical social capital to
   build community resilience.},

Title = {Low-End Probabilistic Sea-Level Projections},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In the area of sea-level rise, recent research has focused on assessing
   either likely or high end future sea levels, but less attention has been
   given to low-end sea-level projections, exploring best-case potential
   sea-level changes and providing the basis for estimating minimum
   adaptation needs. Here, we provide global and regional probabilistic
   sea-level projections using conservative projections of glaciers and
   ice-sheets melting and a selection of models from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) delivering moderate thermal
   expansion. Our low-end sea-level projections are higher than previously
   estimated because they rely on modeling outcomes only, and do not add
   any expert judgement, aiming essentially at delivering more realistic
   upper tails. While there are good reasons to believe that our
   projections are excessively optimistic, they can be used as low-end
   sea-level projections in order to inform users with low aversion to
   uncertainty. Our low-end sea-level projection exceeds 0.5 m along most
   inhabited coasts by 2100 for business as usual greenhouse gas emissions
   (RCP8.5), which is relevant for adaptation practitioners as long as
   efficient climate change mitigation policies are not implemented. This
   means that without efficient climate mitigation, an acceleration of
   sea-level rise can hardly be avoided during the 21st century.},

Title = {Redesigning biodiversity conservation projects for climate change:
   examples from the field},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {185-201},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Few conservation projects consider climate impacts or have a process for
   developing adaptation strategies. To advance climate adaptation for
   biodiversity conservation, we tested a step-by-step approach to
   developing adaptation strategies with 20 projects from diverse
   geographies. Project teams assessed likely climate impacts using
   historical climate data, future climate predictions, expert input, and
   scientific literature. They then developed adaptation strategies that
   considered ecosystems and species of concern, project goals, climate
   impacts, and indicators of progress. Project teams identified 176 likely
   climate impacts and developed adaptation strategies to address 42 of
   these impacts. The most common impacts were to habitat quantity or
   quality, and to hydrologic regimes. Nearly half of expected impacts were
   temperature-mediated. Twelve projects indicated that the project focus,
   either focal ecosystems and species or project boundaries, need to
   change as a result of considering climate impacts. More than half of the
   adaptation strategies were resistance strategies aimed at preserving the
   status quo. The rest aimed to make ecosystems and species more resilient
   in the face of expected changes. All projects altered strategies in some
   way, either by adding new actions, or by adjusting existing actions.
   Habitat restoration and enactment of policies and regulations were the
   most frequently prescribed, though every adaptation strategy required a
   unique combination of actions. While the effectiveness of these
   adaptation strategies remains to be evaluated, the application of
   consistent guidance has yielded important early lessons about how, when,
   and how often conservation projects may need to be modified to adapt to
   climate change.},

Title = {Towards adaptation pathways for atoll islands. Insights from the
   Maldives},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Coastal areas host a significant part of the world population and of
   humankind's adaptation needs in the face of effects of climate change,
   especially sea-level rise and ocean warming and acidification. Atoll
   islands illustrate frontline situations due to their biophysical (low
   elevation, small land area, 360 degrees-exposure to waves, limited
   natural resources and fragile ecosystems) and human (high population
   densities in urban environments, low level of development, limited
   technical and financial capacities) characteristics. In these contexts,
   it is urgent to understand the space for societal adaptation and based
   on this, identify robust and context-specific adaptation strategies.
   This essay builds on the hypothesis that, given the nature of atoll
   islands, understanding the way and extent to which local human-driven
   disturbances affect the reef-island system's capacity to provide coastal
   protection services, is a relevant entry point. Using the case of the
   Maldives, we propose to combine five types of adaptation into a generic
   adaptation pathway, and apply it to atoll island types going from no to
   highly disturbed environments. This work highlights two major
   conclusions: first, that diverse island profiles require different
   adaptation pathways; second, that in contexts under high human pressure,
   the window of opportunities for diversified adaptation strategies is
   closing fast.},

Abstract = {Recently, the world has been suffering from the distressing effects of
   one form of climate change, urban heat island (UHI). It means that urban
   and suburban areas' air and surface temperatures are hotter than their
   nearby surrounding rural areas. Pavements and parking lots contributes
   to about 29\% to 45\% of the urban areas, and they contribute to the UHI
   phenomena. During the day, temperature of dark dry surfaces (such as
   pavements and parking lots) in direct sun can reach up to 88 degrees C
   while vegetated surfaces with moist soils might reach only 18 degrees C
   under the same conditions. The increase in temperature due to UHI leads
   to an increase in the peak energy demand using more air conditioners and
   raising the energy bills. It also leads to an increase in the levels of
   greenhouse gas emissions (global worming) and air pollution. Increased
   daytime temperatures, reduced nighttime cooling, and higher air
   pollution levels related to UHIs affects human health as they lead to
   general discomfort, respiratory difficulties, heat cramps, and
   exhaustion. UHI has great and direct effects on the environment, on
   people and on the human health, on energy consumption and on the
   economy, and on the pavement performance. The factors that affect the
   formation and intensity of UHI are versatile in nature. These factors
   vary between geographic location, time of day and season, synoptic
   weather, city size, city function and city form. The last two factors
   are the factors which can be controlled in order to mitigate UHI. Recent
   studies showed more interest in analyzing and quantifying the UHI
   phenomenon with more focus on the mitigation techniques. It is
   abundantly clear that there must be strategies to measure, model and
   control the phenomenon and achieve one of the Sustainable Development
   Goals, namely; sustainable cities and communities. The primary focus of
   this concise, yet comprehensive state of the art paper is to present the
   different technologies to mitigate the urban heat island. This study
   presented the different UHI definitions, causes, evaluation methods, and
   finally compared between the different mitigation techniques and set
   recommendations and guidelines based on a comprehensive literature
   review.},

Abstract = {Although projected precipitation increases in East Asia due to future
   climate change have aroused concern, less attention has been paid by the
   scientific community and public to the potential long-term increase in
   precipitation due to rapid urbanization. A ten-year precipitation
   dataset was analysed for both a rapidly urbanized megacity and nearby
   suburban/rural stations in southern China. Rapid urbanization in the
   megacity was evident from satellite observations. A statistically
   significant, long-term, increasing trend of precipitation existed only
   at the megacity station (45.6 mm per decade) and not at the other
   stations. The increase was attributed to thermal and dynamical
   modifications of the tropospheric boundary layer related to
   urbanization, which was confirmed by the results of our WRF-SLUCM
   simulations. The results also suggested that a long-term regional
   increase in precipitation, caused by greenhouse gas-induced climate
   change, for instance, was not evident within the study period. The
   urbanization-induced increase was found to be higher than the
   precipitation increase (183 mm per decade) expected from future climate
   change. The direct climate impacts due to rapid urbanization is
   highlighted with strong implications for urban sustainable development
   and the planning of effective adaptation strategies for issues such as
   coastal defenses, mosquito-borne disease spread and heat stress
   mortality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article provides an assessment of the changes in marine climate
   drivers (hazards), associated impacts, risks, and adaptation to the
   coastal China zones and seas since the mid 20th century. The results
   show that: (1) Marine climate drivers,such as ocean warming,sea level
   rise, typhoon, storm surges and marine heat waves (MHWs),have increased
   significantly in strength, frequency and range over the past decades.
   (2) Ocean warming has caused substantial changes in marine phenology,
   species composition, geographical distribution, and frequent occurrences
   of ecological disasters such as red tides, green tides,and
   macro-jellyfish outbreaks, while MHWs have induced degradation in
   tropical coral reefs and major losses in the marine aquaculture industry
   in the coastal China seas. (3) Sea level rise threatens the typical
   habitats of coastal wetlands such as mangrove and estuaries,and
   exacerbates coastal erosion, seawater intrusion and the impacts of
   typhoon, storm surges on the coastal flood disasters. (4) Human
   activities,such as large-scale reclamation, pollutant discharge, and
   over-fishing, have increased the exposure and vulnerability of China's
   marine and coastal ecosystems, leading to the low-aging and
   miniaturization of fishery types, decline of offshore fishery resources,
   reduction of coastal wetland areas,and degradation of biodiversity and
   ecosystem stability. (5) Under different climate scenarios such as low
   and high greenhouse gases emission scenario (RCP 2.6 and 8.5), as the
   warming and sea level rise in the coastal China seas continue,extreme
   sea level (ESL) events will occur more frequently, e.g., by the end of
   this century, the current once per century ESL events will become
   annually or even annually less (RCP 8.5) in many coastal areas,such as
   at Lvsi and Xiamen tidal gauge stations; and the ESL events could pose
   serious risks on the coastal areas. Finally, the article further
   discusses the adaptation measures and related uncertain issues to
   address climate change in the coastal China zones and seas,and puts
   forward relevant countermeasures and suggestions in order to reduce its
   negative impacts on the sustainable development of human community.},

Abstract = {The extent and duration of sea-ice habitats used by Pacific walrus
   (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) are diminishing resulting in altered
   walrus behavior, mortality, and distribution. I document changes that
   have occurred over the past several decades and make predictions to the
   end of the 21st century. Climate models project that sea ice will
   monotonically decline resulting in more ice-free summers of longer
   duration. Several stressors that may impact walruses are directly
   influenced by sea ice. How these stressors materialize were modeled as
   most likely-case, worst-case, and best-case scenarios for the mid- and
   late-21st century, resulting in four comprehensive working hypotheses
   that can help identify and prioritize management and research projects,
   identify comprehensive mitigation actions, and guide monitoring programs
   to track future developments and adjust programs as needed. In the short
   term, the most plausible hypotheses predict a continuing northward shift
   in walrus distribution, increasing use of coastal haulouts in summer and
   fall, and a population reduction set by the carrying capacity of the
   near shore environment and subsistence hunting. Alternatively, under
   worst-case conditions, the population will decline to a level where the
   probability of extinction is high. In the long term, walrus may
   seasonally abandon the Bering and Chukchi Seas for sea-ice refugia to
   the northwest and northeast, ocean warming and pH decline alter walrus
   food resources, and subsistence hunting exacerbates a large population
   decline. However, conditions that reverse current trends in sea ice loss
   cannot be ruled out. Which hypothesis comes to fruition depends on how
   the stressors develop and the success of mitigation measures. Best-case
   scenarios indicate that successful mitigation of unsustainable harvests
   and terrestrial haulout-related mortalities can be effective. Management
   and research should focus on monitoring, elucidating effects, and
   mitigation, while ultimately, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are
   needed to reduce sea-ice habitat losses.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions may increase global mean sea-level
   by about 1 meter during this century. Such elevation of the mean
   sea-level enhances the risk of flooding of coastal areas. We compute the
   power capacity that is currently out-of-reach of a 100-year coastal
   flooding but will be exposed to such a flood by the end of the century
   for different US states, if no adaptation measures are taken. The
   additional exposed capacity varies strongly among states. For Delaware
   it is 80\% of the mean generated power load. For New York this number is
   63\% and for Florida 43\%. The capacity that needs additional protection
   compared to today increases by more than 250\% for Texas, 90\% for
   Florida and 70\% for New York. Current development in power plant
   building points towards a reduced future exposure to sea-level rise:
   proposed and planned power plants are less exposed than those which are
   currently operating. However, power plants that have been retired or
   canceled were less exposed than those operating at present. If sea-level
   rise is properly accounted for in future planning, an adaptation to
   sea-level rise may be costly but possible.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise and uncertainty in its projections pose a major challenge
   to flood risk management and adaptation investments in coastal mega
   cities. This study presents a comparative economic evaluation method for
   flood adaptation measures, which couples a cost-benefit analysis with
   the concept of adaptation pathways. Our approach accounts for
   uncertainty in sea level rise projections by allowing for flexibility of
   adaptation strategies over time. Our method is illustrated for Los
   Angeles County which is vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise.
   Results for different sea level rise scenarios show that applying
   adaptation pathways can result in higher economic efficiency (up to
   10\%) than individual adaptation strategies, despite the loss of
   efficiency at the initial strategy. However, we identified `investment
   tipping points', after which a transition could decrease the economic
   efficiencies of a pathway significantly. Overall, we recommend that
   studies evaluating adaptation strategies should integrate cost-benefit
   analysis frameworks with adaptation pathways since this allows for
   better informing decision makers about the robustness and economic
   desirability of their investment choices. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {Deep ocean storage of CO2 could help reduce the atmospheric level of
   greenhouse gas as part of a climate change mitigation strategy. In this
   paper, a multiphase flow model of CO2 sequestration into deep ocean
   sediments was designed associated with the formation of CO2 hydrates. A
   simplified assumption was proposed to predict the critical time of CO2
   leakage from marine sedimentary strata into seawater. Moreover, some
   principal parameters, which include the permeability, anisotropy, total
   injection amount, and length of the injection part of wellbores, were
   investigated by numerical simulations. The numerical estimates are used
   to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of CO2 storage in deep ocean
   sediments. Accurately predicting the actual fate of liquid CO2
   sequestered into the marine sedimentary strata at depths greater than
   500 m is complicated by uncertainties associated with not only the
   chemical-physical behavior of CO2 under such conditions but also the
   geo-environment of disposal sites. Modeling results have shown some
   implications that the effectiveness of CO2 ocean sequestration depends
   mainly on the injection conditions (such as injection rate, total
   injection amount, and the depth of injection), the site geology (such as
   permeability and anisotropy of disposal formations), and the
   chemical-physical behavior of CO2 in marine environment. (c) 2008

Abstract = {The specter of climate change threatens fresh water resources along the
   U.S.-Mexico border. Water managers and planners on both sides of the
   border are promoting desalination-the conversion of seawater or brackish
   groundwater to fresh water-as an adaptation response that can help meet
   growing water demands and buffer against the negative impacts of climate
   change on regional water supplies. However, the uneven distribution of
   costs and benefits of this expensive, energy-intensive technology is
   likely to exacerbate existing social inequalities in the border zone. In
   this paper, we examine the discourses employed in the construction of
   the climate problem and proposed solutions. We focus our analysis on a
   proposed Arizona-Sonora binational desalination project and use insights
   from risk and hazards literature to analyze how, why, and to what effect
   desalination is emerging as a preferred climate change adaptation
   response. Our risk analysis shows that while desalination technology can
   reduce some vulnerabilities (e.g., future water supply), it can also
   introduce new vulnerabilities by compounding the water-energy nexus,
   increasing greenhouse gas emissions, inducing urban growth, producing
   brine discharge and chemical pollutants, shifting geopolitical relations
   of water security, and increasing water prices. Additionally, a
   high-tech and path-dependent response will likely result in increased
   reliance on technical expertise, less opportunity for participatory
   decision-making and reduced flexibility. The paper concludes by
   proposing alternative adaptation responses that can offer greater
   flexibility, are less path dependent, incorporate social learning, and
   target the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community. These
   alternatives can build greater adaptive capacity and ensure equity. (C)

Title = {Carbon Cycle Response to Temperature Overshoot Beyond 2 degrees C: An
   Analysis of CMIP6 Models},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There is a substantial gap between the current emissions of greenhouse
   gases and levels required for achieving the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees
   C temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. Understanding the
   implications of a temperature overshoot is thus an increasingly relevant
   research topic. Here we explore the carbon cycle feedbacks over land and
   ocean in the SSP5-3.4-OS overshoot scenario by using an ensemble of
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 Earth system models. Models show
   that after the CO2 concentration and air temperature peaks, land and
   ocean are decreasing carbon sinks from the 2,040s and become sources for
   a limited time in the 22nd century. The decrease in the carbon uptake
   precedes the CO2 concentration peak. The early peak of ocean uptake
   stems from its dependency on the atmospheric CO2 growth rate. The early
   peak of the land uptake occurs due to a larger increase in ecosystem
   respiration than the increase in gross primary production, as well as
   due to a concomitant increase in land-use change emissions primarily
   attributed to the wide implementation of biofuel croplands. The carbon
   cycle feedback parameters amplify after the CO2 concentration and
   temperature peaks due to inertia of the Earth system so that land and
   ocean absorb more carbon per unit change in the atmospheric CO 2 change
   (stronger negative feedback) and lose more carbon per unit temperature
   change (stronger positive feedback) compared to if the feedbacks stayed
   unchanged. The increased negative CO2 feedback outperforms the increased
   positive climate feedback. This feature should be investigated under
   other scenarios. Plain Language Summary A large gap between required and
   currently planned greenhouse gas emission reductions makes possible
   overshooting the 2 degrees C target of the Paris Agreement before the
   temperature can return below the target levels. We explore the response
   of the global carbon cycle to overshoot by analyzing the simulations of
   state-of-art models under an overshoot pathway, where the emissions
   increase until the 2,030s and exhibit a steep reduction thereafter. The
   land and ocean continue to take up carbon from the atmosphere throughout
   the 21st century, albeit at a reduced rate. The decrease in the ocean
   carbon uptake occurs before the CO2 concentration peak due to its
   dependence on the rate of the atmospheric CO2 change, and the decrease
   in the land uptake occurs due to a stronger increase in the ecosystem
   respiration than in the photosynthetic carbon absorption and
   simultaneous large landuse-change emissions from the expansion of
   biofuel crops. After the peaks, land and ocean absorb more carbon from
   the atmosphere due to higher CO2 concentration and lose more carbon due
   to warmer temperatures. The influence of higher CO2 concentration wins
   over the influence of warming, allowing land and ocean to remain carbon
   sinks till the end of the 21st century.

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},

Volume = {258},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Emerging concern on shipping air emission and sustainable port
   management arises the necessity of appropriate guideline and
   perspective. Although estimation of vessel air emission using fuel
   consumption statistics has been broadly applied for national or regional
   emission inventory so far in many countries, it still requires further
   considerations to minutely understand how large emission is occurred in
   particular locations and periods. This study aimed to investigate the
   vessel PM10 emissions following activity-based estimation method to
   bring elaborated local air emission inventory and sustainable practices
   between marine infrastructure, technologies and port-city as a case
   study of Incheon, Republic of Korea. In consequence, certain amount of
   regional maritime PM10 emission around Port of Incheon was highlighted
   that 847 ton/year which would be more elaborate than the amount of
   fuel-based estimation method. Spatially distributed PM10 emission map in
   high-resolution (500m grid) was also available from activity-based
   estimation method which could be helpful to discover future
   implementations such as actual environmental impact assessment, policy
   making and mitigation technology development in a port-city. Therefore,
   the implications of this study would provide better perspectives and
   considerations on marine technology development, port-city management
   and environment improvement as guiding future works in various fields of
   ocean applications.},

Abstract = {The attractiveness and urbanisation of coastal zones increase their
   vulnerability to climate change and sea-level rise, in particular to
   flooding and marine erosion. In the face of the projected increase in
   losses and damages, the anticipation and measures needed for adaptation
   involve physical, socioeconomic and political dimensions at different
   governance levels and timescales. A large literature addresses these
   various issues, generally in a targeted way. Drawing on adaptive policy
   pathways approaches and on research results of the past decade in
   mainland France, this article proposes an interdisciplinary
   characterisation of long-term adaptation pathways in coastal areas.
   Among the different variables and processes of change that characterise
   coastal zones and their future, particular emphasis is placed on social
   and institutional dynamics. This work contributes to the debate about
   adaptive governance in a highly uncertain context as well as to recent
   work to explore pathways and tipping points in support of climate
   adaptation policies.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are known to alter hydrological
   cycles, disrupt marine ecosystems and species lifecycles, and cause
   global habitat loss. In this study, we use a comprehensive global input
   output database to assess the driving forces underlying the change in
   global CO, emissions from 1990 to 2010. We decompose the change in
   emissions for the 20 year period into six mutually exclusive causal
   determinants. Our assessment of trends in fuel-use reveals that a 10.8
   Peta-gram (Pg) rise in emissions from 1990 to 2010 constitutes emissions
   from the consumption of coal (49\%), petroleum (25\%), natural gas
   (17\%), and biomass (9\%). We demonstrate that affluence (per-capita
   consumption) and population growth are outpacing any improvements in
   carbon efficiency in driving up emissions worldwide. Our results suggest
   that supply chain measures to improve technological efficiency are not
   sufficient to reduce emissions. To achieve significant emission savings,
   policy makers need to address the issue of affluence. We argue that
   policies to address unsustainable lifestyles and consumer behavior are
   largely unheard of, and governments may need to actively intervene in
   nonsustainable lifestyles to achieve emission reductions. The results
   presented in this paper are vital for informing future policy decisions
   for mitigating climate change.},

Title = {THE USE OF IRON AND OTHER TRACE-ELEMENT FERTILIZERS IN MITIGATING GLOBAL
   WARMING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {If current trends continue, before the end of the next century
   atmospheric CO2 levels will be about double those of a century ago.
   Other greenhouse gases, including methane and chlorofluorocarbons, also
   are increasing at similar or even higher rates. The effects of such
   global atmospheric changes on climate, and, thus, on agriculture,
   forestry and natural ecosystems, are uncertain. Only the results of the
   planetary ``experiment{''} itself will provide a definitive answer.
   Current projections range from catastrophic to favorable. Prudence
   suggests that steps be taken to slow down these rapid atmospheric
   changes, even in the absence of a definitive estimate of risks.
   Natural sinks for CO2 already account for the disappearance of as much
   as 60\% of anthropogenic CO2 production due to fossil fuel combustion,
   deforestation, and soil organic carbon oxidation. Thus, current rates of
   increases in atmospheric CO2, about 0.4\% per year, could be cut in half
   by reducing anthropogenic CO2 outputs by 20\%, or increasing sinks by a
   similar amount. Such a reduction would significantly reduce the risks of
   major climatic changes. Programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are
   being instituted in Japan and Europe, but not in the U.S. or most other
   countries.
   Reduction of CO2 buildup must focus on the reduction of the major
   sources - fossil fuel usage, deforestation, soil carbon oxidation - and
   on increasing sinks. The only practical methods for increasing CO2 sinks
   are based on photosynthesis, primarily through increased C storage in
   standing tree biomass, the use biomass as substitutes for fossil fuels,
   and, possibly, through the stimulation of ocean primary productivity by
   iron fertilization.
   Fertilizing forests and oceans with iron and other trace elements to
   increase primary productivity and CO2 sequestration is an attractive
   concept. Application of small quantities of trace elements, could, in
   principle, result in the sequestration of many tons of CO2. Iron limits
   primary productivity in some ocean areas. How to practically fertilize
   the oceans with iron, the environmental impacts of such additions, and
   their effectiveness in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations are
   controversial issues. Long-term studies of ocean fertilization will be
   required, and such schemes can not be included in current global warming
   mitigation options.
   Iron and other trace elements are often limiting factors in agriculture,
   and many reports exist of such limitations in managed forestry. However,
   it is presently unclear how widespread such deficiencies are in managed
   forests, and global effects on CO2 balances can not be projected.
   Fertilization with major nutrients - P, K, and N - is often effective in
   stimulating forest productivity and could be an economical approach to
   large-scale CO2 sequestration. Increased forest fertilization with major
   nutrients will, in many cases, also require applications of some trace
   elements. In conclusion, forest fertilization with trace elements and
   even major nutrients could be an affordable and near-term method of
   reducing future global warming.},

Title = {Mitigating temperature increases in high lot density sub-tropical
   residential developments},

Volume = {37},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Residential developments built with houses that use passive design
   features can have significantly reduced energy requirements for thermal
   comfort. In the context of global warming, this can reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions. The current trend towards higher lot density in
   residential developments and the resulting increase in thermal mass
   increases the associated heat island effect. Designers of future
   residential developments face the dual challenges of heat island impacts
   and any future global warming. Resource efficient house designs combined
   with approaches that mitigate the outdoor heat load must be considered
   and addressed from the design of the initial subdivision layout. Some
   land sub-division and house design initiatives are proposed for
   sub-tropical climatic conditions as prevailing in south-east Queensland,
   Australia. Computer simulations that account for heat island and global
   warming effects are used to estimate the indoor thermal performance of
   display houses constructed by a large scale property developer for
   current climate conditions and scenarios that may occur in the future.
   The use of north-south orientation of narrow building lots combined with
   high albedo house surfaces and the increased strategic use of shade
   trees for reducing the heat island effect of high density residential
   developments are presented. The cooling requirements of houses with
   high-energy rating (5 star or more) are found to be significantly
   superior to those with low rating (3.5 star) in scenarios of global
   warming. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Green infrastructure is strategic and spatial approach to landscape and
   environment planning, applying key principles of landscape ecology to
   urban environments, and specifically planning in multi-scale approach.
   It is adopted and developed as a result of the opportunities it has
   provided in various disciplines to meet ecological, environmental,
   social challenges of landscape planning. Multi use of green
   infrastructure has the potential of contributing to climate change
   adaptation in various scales and regions. Climate change as a result of
   historical emissions of greenhouse gases would jeopardize cities. The
   deficiency of existing urban systems to cope with the risks resulting
   from these changes such as floods, droughts and extreme temperatures
   (intensification of the urban island heat effect), render residents of
   cities vulnerable to these changes. Green infrastructure by providing a
   range of ecosystem services has a significant role to play in helping to
   combat climate change. In this paper, it is investigated how and in what
   function and services, Green infrastructure strategy can help us in
   adopting to climate change in urban landscape context. At the first
   step, we classified the methods, principle and impacts on these two
   strategies (climate change adaptation and green infrastructure) to
   compare them. Then through this comparison, a conceptual model is
   developed clarifying their complementarity and relationship.},

Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The increase in frequency and duration of marine heatwaves (MHWs) under
   global warming brings great pressure to society. The high vulnerability
   of ecosystems to MHWs may lead to severe ecological and socioeconomic
   impacts. Most studies assessed future climate responses at the Paris
   Agreement temperature goals based on transient, rather than
   stabilization, model simulations. Here, we investigate the differences
   between transient and stabilization responses at global warming of 1.5
   degrees C in terms of MHWs. Concentrations of greenhouse gases and
   response time scales to the anthropogenic forcing differ in these two
   types of simulations because subsurface ocean temperatures take decades
   to centuries to adjust under external forcing. While global mean metrics
   of MHWs show little difference between the transient and stabilization
   responses, significant regional disparities are revealed worldwide,
   including many climate change hotspots. Regionally intensified MHWs at
   stabilized 1.5 degrees C are mostly due to air-sea interactions and
   subsurface ocean warming that contributes to the stronger SST warming in
   eastern boundary upwelling systems and the southern Indian Ocean,
   indicative of potentially greater impacts on marine ecosystems in these
   regions. In contrast, MHWs would be alleviated in the central equatorial
   Pacific and Arctic in stabilization responses. Substantial differences
   in regional MHWs between the transient and stabilization responses
   oblige us to reconsider previous assessments regarding 1.5 degrees C
   warming and future mitigation pathways.},

Title = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigating strategies: A case-based comparative
   analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanisation may have been shown to have no effect on climate change,
   but some researchers suggest that cities are fully capable of responding
   to it. Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) represent dense urban areas within
   cities where the temperature is recorded to be higher than the
   neighbouring areas or those located in suburbia. Mitigation of UHI
   effects can help diminish detriments of climate change. This paper sets
   out to establish UHI mitigation strategies, their effectiveness and
   resilience to help provide recommendations for application of such
   strategies in future. Existing literature suggest that UK is facing with
   growing problem of UHI effects and sustainable development at urban
   scale can be improved if proportionate measures are taken to mitigate
   those effects. The lack of guidance for designers and planners with
   regards to UHI mitigation is also indicated in the literature where
   trees, shrubs and grass (TSG), use of high albedo materials (HAM) in
   external building surfaces and urban inland water bodies (UIWB) are
   identified as effective measures to mitigate UHI. This research
   identifies and tests resilience and effectiveness of UHI mitigation
   strategies, using ENVI-met simulations and through Urban Futures
   Assessment Method (UFAM). Assessed mitigation strategies (TSG, HAM,
   UIWB) are shown to have a similar level of resilience which could be
   improved if proper future-proof measures are taken in place. As a
   result, some practical suggestions are provided to help improve the
   resilience of tested UHI mitigation strategies in this study. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This chapter represents the status of land degradation in Greece. As
   everywhere in the Mediterranean region, processes such as climatic
   change, extreme climatic events, and human actions accelerate land
   degradation and desertification and are reflected by the reduction of
   the capacity of the land to maintain its economic, ecological and
   productive functions. The main land degradation processes operating in
   the soil, water and biosphere system, cause soil degradation, water
   scarcity and decline of biodiversity. Greek soils are degradated by
   water and wind erosion, soil organic matter reduction, salinization,
   alkalization, fertility depletion, compaction, crusting, acidification,
   leaching, soil pollution and contamination, floods, landslides and
   sealing. Water scarcity and quality deterioration is exacerbated through
   continuing overexploitation of surface and ground water, poor management
   practices, pollution from point and diffuse sources and salinization
   through seawater intrusion. Land use change, wild fires, overgrazing,
   intensification of agriculture, and monoculture affect population
   dynamics and biodiversity while accelerating soil and water degradation
   processes and greenhouse gases emissions. The National Action Plan to
   Combat Desertification, the National Water Management plan, the Code of
   Good Agricultural Practices and the Soil Thematic Strategy in
   combination with international scientific cooperation and the creation
   of an harmonized monitoring system should provide to all stakeholders,
   especially to policy makers, the necessary knowledge, structure and
   measures to mitigate land degradation.},

   constrains implementation in practice. Through collaboration and

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that the Earth's climate has become increasingly
   warmer, most likely due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The
   variability in climate refers to natural changes in climate that fall
   within the normal range of extremes for a particular region, as measured
   by temperature, precipitation and frequency of events. This variation is
   driven by the uneven distribution of solar heating, the individual
   responses of the atmosphere, oceans and land surface, the interactions
   between these and the physical characteristics of the regions. Climate
   change is expected to exacerbate the already serious challenges to human
   health, food security and economic development, especially on the
   African Continent where people are already struggling to meet challenges
   posed by existing climate variability. Although climate disasters of the
   past and present decades and their disastrous consequences were not
   limited to or peculiar to Nigeria or Africa; adaptation to climate
   variability and changes seems to be especially relevant for Africa, due
   to her low coping capacity to impacts of the changes. Climate, more
   especially temperature has a strong and direct influence on development,
   reproduction and survival of tropical insects such as mosquitoes. Since
   insect population growth potentials are mainly temperature driven, a
   rise in temperature may either increase or decrease insect development,
   likewise rainfall. This paper highlights malaria incidence as a
   consequence of climate variability and its adaptation by the urbanites
   within Owerri microclimate in Imo State of Nigeria. It employed the use
   of 20 years (1990-2000) temperature and rainfall data for Owerri from
   Nigerian Meteorological Agency and available 10 years (2000 - 2009) data
   on average malaria cases in Owerri metropolis from primary health care
   data center, Owerri. The results show variations in the climate of
   Owerri city and the resultant malaria incidence within the period under
   study, hence evidence of climate variability and change in Nigeria
   includes increasing heat waves which enhances disease vectors,
   communicable diseases and epidemics. However, Owerri people are adapting
   positively to control the spread of malaria being one of the impacts of
   climate variability in the metropolis but however, more adaptation
   strategies are needed.},

Abstract = {The World Health Organization has developed standardized comparative
   risk assessment methods for estimating aggregate disease burdens
   attributable to different risk factors. These have been applied to
   existing and new models for a range of climate-sensitive diseases in
   order to estimate the effect of global climate change on current disease
   burdens and likely proportional changes in the future. The comparative
   risk assessment approach has been used to assess the health consequences
   of climate change worldwide, to inform decisions on mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions, and in a regional assessment of the Oceania
   region in the Pacific Ocean to provide more location-specific
   information relevant to local mitigation and adaptation decisions. The
   approach places climate change within the same criteria for
   epidemiologic assessment as other health risks and accounts for the size
   of the burden of climate-sensitive diseases rather than just
   proportional change, which highlights the importance of small
   proportional changes in diseases such as diarrhea and malnutrition that
   cause a large burden. These exercises help clarify important knowledge
   gaps such as a relatively poor understanding of the role of nonclimatic
   factors (socioeconomic and other) that may modify future climatic
   influences and a lack of empiric evidence and methods for quantifying
   more complex climate-health relationships, which consequently are often
   excluded from consideration. These exercises highlight the need for risk
   assessment frameworks that make the best use of traditional
   epidemiologic methods and that also fully consider the specific
   characteristics of climate change. These include the long-term and
   uncertain nature of the exposure and the effects on multiple physical
   and biotic systems that have the potential for diverse and widespread
   effects, including high-impact events.},

   the Asia-Pacific region - awareness and mitigation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-85},
Abstract = {The fast-growing, coastal megacities of the Asia-Pacific region are
   expanding into areas that are vulnerable to marine-related physical
   natural hazards, or, because of physical environmental changes, will
   become increasingly vulnerable within the timescale of city planning.
   The hazards comprise those that are due to extreme events such as storm
   surge and tsunami which may be catastrophic in their impacts; and those
   that relate to continuing changes over the long-term, notably global
   sea-lever rise, sedimentary consolidation and coastal erosion. The
   latter may be exacerbated by human activities such as the increasing
   production of `greenhouse' gases and over-abstraction of groundwater,
   and, while not threatening catastrophic loss of life or destruction of
   property, do have important economic and social implications for the
   future.
   There are two complementary approaches to hazard mitigation -
   constraining the hazard, and reducing vulnerability to the hazard. The
   contributions that science can make in the planning and implementation
   of sustainable adaptive measures are to improve the quantification of
   the incidence and severity of the various hazards, establishing
   realistic timescales of incidence, estimating return periods; and to
   establish the geographical limits of vulnerability to the hazards in a
   range of likely scenarios over timescales appropriate to the planning
   cycle. Contemporary, high risk, hazard scenarios for existing city
   developments demand an approach which focuses on effective warning
   networks and emergency planning; long-term, incremental hazards that are
   forecast to affect both developed and periurban areas can be addressed
   with a strategic planning approach, involving relocation and capital
   protective works. The selection of strategic measures demands the best
   possible predictive information on hazards and on vulnerability,
   including its full socio-economic evaluation so that the costs and
   benefits of the possible mitigation options can be realistically
   assessed. A predictive capacity, developed through modelling, requires
   the collection of reliable baseline and monitoring data relating to the
   hazards over a range of timescales in local, regional and global
   perspectives. (C) 1998 Natural Environment Research Council. Elsevier

Abstract = {Despite progressive policies and continued advances in ocean management,
   numerous shifts associated with global changes have been observed in
   marine ecosystems in recent years, including warming, ocean
   acidification, and deoxygenation. As global change accelerates, science
   is needed to inform evidence-based management strategies for continued
   ecosystem services. Resilience management, in which actions are
   undertaken to promote the resistance and recovery responses of
   populations and ecosystems to disturbance, has been suggested as a
   possible strategy. However, empirical evidence for effective resilience
   management is still limited. To inform effective management strategies,
   mechanisms that underlie resilience to global change that can be
   influenced by management-ready actions must be identified and tested
   through observations, experiments, and modeling. Here, we discuss the
   potential links between three common management strategies (i.e.,
   spatial restrictions such as marine protected areas, coordinated spatial
   protections, and fisheries management approaches) and potential
   mechanisms of resilience for marine populations and ecosystems, and
   provide guidance for future research on resilience management for a
   changing ocean drawing on insight gained by the Partnership for
   Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans' work at the science-policy
   interface in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Climate change has become the biggest risk to the nutritional and food
   security of the planet worldwide. Rising temperatures, uneven rainfall,
   cyclones and droughts are unfavourably impacting agricultural
   production, which, in turn, is creating an elevated vulnerability to the
   livelihood of Bangladesh's huge population. Bangladesh is an agrarian
   country and almost half of the population depends on agriculture
   activities as a profession. But the agriculture sector of the country is
   experiencing adverse impacts at various levels and ways because of
   climate change-induced natural hazards. The present study was done to
   explore the salinity intrusion problem, soil fertility and rice
   production in the study areas. Besides, the authors also discover some
   indigenous knowledge-based adaptation and coping practices of the
   farmers for reducing the impact of climate change in the study areas.
   The study disclosed that salinity intrusion into the surface water
   recorded at high values everywhere and the quality of the sediments was
   alarming. According to the experiences of the farmers, knowledge and
   resources, they looked for adaptation strategies to cope with the
   changing climatic situation. The study will help to demonstrate
   adaptation practices by the farmers for reducing the salinity level of
   the agriculture field which will be effective in the vulnerable areas of
   other parts of the country and worldwide while the area was affected by
   the salinisation problem.},

Abstract = {Ever since the 2003 heat wave that caused 70,000 heat deaths, the
   dramatic consequences of climate change and rising temperatures in
   Europe have become an intensively researched topic. During heat waves,
   the older urban adult population is at highest risk. The STOPHOT project
   is the first investigation in Austria to establish a comprehensive
   knowledge base on heat perception, awareness of heat risks and
   adaptive/coping behaviours among older adults. The main research
   questions include: (1) Does climate change endanger the chances of
   successful ageing in urban areas? (2) How do age, social inequalities
   and the living environment intersect with environmental stressors in
   affecting successful ageing? (3) Which heat adaption strategies do older
   adults deploy and to what extent can they mediate heat stress in an
   effort to increase chances of successful ageing under the conditions of
   climate change? The results indicate that climate change and rising
   temperatures are in fact one important determinant of whether and how an
   older person can maintain well-being in later life. Older adults (> 65
   years) with a low socio-economic status and poor health conditions, who
   tend to be socially isolated, are most at risk. However, no `heat island
   effect' of the residential environment could be found. How much a person
   suffers from heat stress is highly dependent on the adaption strategies
   deployed. Adaption strategies of older urban residents mostly centred on
   body-related measures, such as drinking more or wearing lighter clothes,
   and indoor-centred measures, particularly avoiding the outdoors.},

   smallholder farmers in Indonesia},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered
   a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the
   protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned
   into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little
   research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such
   climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and
   around peatlands. We present in-sights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia
   and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how
   an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has
   become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use
   agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win-win
   low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to
   much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous
   policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and
   forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on
   development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a
   reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of
   smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis
   suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from
   tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate
   mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs
   through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and
   help restore degraded peatlands.},

Title = {Opportunities for Mineral Carbonation in Australia's Mining Industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) via mineral carbonation
   is an effective method for long-term storage of carbon dioxide and
   combating climate change. Implemented at a large-scale, it provides a
   viable solution to harvesting and storing the modern crisis of GHGs
   emissions. To date, technological and economic barriers have inhibited
   broad-scale utilisation of mineral carbonation at industrial scales.
   This paper outlines the mineral carbonation process; discusses drivers
   and barriers of mineral carbonation deployment in Australian mining;
   and, finally, proposes a unique approach to commercially viable CCUS
   within the Australian mining industry by integrating mine waste
   management with mine site rehabilitation, and leveraging relationships
   with local coal-fired power station. This paper discusses using alkaline
   mine and coal-fired power station waste (fly ash, red mud, and
   ultramafic mine tailings, i.e., nickel, diamond, PGE (platinum group
   elements), and legacy asbestos mine tailings) as the feedstock for CCUS
   to produce environmentally benign materials, which can be used in mine
   reclamation. Geographical proximity of mining operations, mining waste
   storage facilities and coal-fired power stations in Australia are
   identified; and possible synergies between them are discussed. This
   paper demonstrates that large-scale alkaline waste production and mine
   site reclamation can become integrated to mechanise CCUS. Furthermore,
   financial liabilities associated with such waste management and site
   reclamation could overcome many of the current economic setbacks of
   retrofitting CCUS in the mining industry. An improved approach to
   commercially viable climate change mitigation strategies available to
   the mining industry is reviewed in this paper.},

Abstract = {The oceans are in trouble. Poorly understood and unprecedented
   environmental and economic changes are underway in our world's oceans
   that will significantly affect life in the sea as well as on land. Only
   in the last thirty years has the contribution of the ocean sector to the
   economy been measured. An examination of these studies has exposed
   definitional, conceptual and methodological differences in measuring
   marine-related economic activity in the economy, making comparisons
   difficult. Both the ocean and the coastal economies face a world of
   volatile changes. In the ocean economy marine transport faces
   unpredictable fuel costs. Coastal tourism also faces losses from climate
   change impacts and sea level rise. Finally. a warming ocean and
   increasing acidification of the oceans from greenhouse gases is already
   affecting coral reefs and a range of fish stocks. Economic measures are
   important to predict these impacts, as are economic measures of the
   resilience of different areas of the ocean and coastal economies. This
   article demonstrates how knowledge of both the ocean, coastal and
   national economies can help governments address the future impacts and
   demands posed by nature and human populations on our coasts and oceans.

   in the United States: Comparison of Two Scenarios},

Abstract = {The biological and economic values of coral reefs are highly vulnerable
   to increasing atmospheric and ocean carbon dioxide concentrations. We
   applied the COMBO simulation model (COral Mortality and Bleaching
   Output) to three major U.S. locations for shallow water reefs: South
   Florida, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. We compared estimates of future coral
   cover from 2000 to 2100 for a ``business as usual{''} (BAU) greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions scenario with a GHG mitigation policy scenario
   involving full international participation in reducing GHG emissions. We
   also calculated the economic value of changes in coral cover using a
   benefit transfer approach based on published studies of consumers'
   recreational values for snorkeling and diving on coral reefs as well as
   existence values for coral reefs. Our results suggest that a reduced
   emissions scenario would provide a large benefit to shallow water reefs
   in Hawaii by delaying or avoiding potential future bleaching events. For
   Hawaii, reducing emissions is projected to result in an estimated
   ``avoided loss{''} from 2000 to 2100 of approximately \$10.6 billion in
   recreational use values compared to a BAU scenario. However, reducing
   emissions is projected to provide only a minor economic benefit in
   Puerto Rico and South Florida, where sea-surface temperatures are
   already close to bleaching thresholds and coral cover is projected to
   drop well below 5\% cover under both scenarios by 2050, and below 1\%
   cover under both scenarios by 2100.},

Title = {Coastal communities in the Circumpolar North and the need for
   sustainable climate adaptation approaches},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of society's greatest contemporary challenges.
   Increasing global temperatures leave coastal locations in particular,
   vulnerable to impacts that include rising sea levels and more extreme
   and variable weather events. Stress can be acute for small coastal
   communities located in the Circumpolar North, where a lack of capacity
   and awareness along with institutional constraints, can exacerbate
   vulnerability. Given that continued climate change is inevitable
   regardless of the extent of mitigative action, adaptation is a
   necessity. In northern regions, there is evidence that adaptation
   planning is occurring in response to observed climate stressors, with
   structural (or hard) adaptation approaches prevalent across the
   sensitive coastline. However, structural adaptations are often
   associated with several drawbacks and may not be suitable, particularly
   in a region that is facing rapid rates of warming, enhanced exposures,
   and significant environmental and socioeconomic constraints. To enhance
   resilience, small northern coastal communities should adopt a
   diversified portfolio of adaptations that incorporate more sustainable
   non-structural and ecosystem-based (or soft) adaptation approaches.},

   development},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-279},
Abstract = {Effectively managing disaster risks is a critical tool for adapting to
   the impacts of climate change. However, climate change mitigation and
   low-carbon development have often been overlooked in disaster risk
   management (DRM) research, policy and practice. This article explores
   the links between DRM and low-carbon development and thereby sheds light
   on a new and emerging research and development agenda. Taking carbon
   considerations into account for DRM and post-disaster reconstruction can
   contribute to laying the foundations for low-carbon development and the
   benefits it can bring. It can also provide an opportunity to combine
   adaptation and mitigation efforts. The article elaborates the carbon
   implications of DRM interventions and post-disaster reconstruction
   practices, drawing on case studies from flood risk reduction, coastal
   protection, drought risk reduction, post-disaster housing and energy
   supply reconstruction. Finally, the article makes suggestions about how
   the carbon implications of DRM measures could be accounted for in a
   coherent manner. Suggestions include calculating the carbon emissions
   from DRM and post-disaster interventions as part of globally
   standardized environmental impact assessments and improving the linkages
   between ministries of environment, energy and climate, and those
   ministries that deal with disasters.},

Booktitle = {NORTH SEA REGION CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT},
Series = {Regional Climate Studies},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {417-429},
Abstract = {About 80 \% of the population within the North Sea countries currently
   lives in an urban area and this percentage is projected to continue to
   rise. Urban areas are not only impacted by changes in regional climate
   but are themselves responsible for causing local modifications in
   regional climate resulting in the so-called `urban climate'. The urban
   climate in North Sea cities has several common features: higher
   temperatures relative to the surrounding regions (especially at night),
   greater temperature variability, deeper but less stable boundary layers
   at night, lower average wind speeds but stronger gusts, reduced
   evapotranspiration, and greater air pollution (local exceedances of
   limit values for nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide and particulate
   matter, with ship emissions a relevant contributor in harbour cities).
   Indications of climate change are now apparent and include hinterland
   flooding, more intense precipitation, and drier and warmer summers.
   Cities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and measures are needed to
   reduce these. Cities also need to adapt to climate change. Despite broad
   similarities between urban areas, in terms of mitigation and adaptation
   to climate change there are large location-specific differences with
   regard to city planning needs. Hamburg and London are used as examples.
   Adaptation measures include better insulation of buildings to reduce
   energy use and anthropogenic heat emissions, higher dykes to protect
   against increased water levels, and rain water drainage to avoid
   hinterland flooding. Scenarios are outlined for urban development with
   greened roofs, higher albedo values and lower sealing of surfaces.},

Abstract = {In tropical area, especially in Sumatra Island, shifting cultivation is
   dominant agricultural system. The farmer used to use fire during land
   preparation as a strategy to overcome labor shortage. Forest fire has
   been given special attention due to its impact to the environment. It
   sources of greenhouse gases emission, ecosystem degradation, and
   wildlife extinction. Once forest fire occur especially on sensitive
   area, it is very difficult to be stop. Under such situation, conducting
   preventive action would be more effective. Mitigation and action through
   forest fire early warning systems were required in Way Kambas National
   Park (WKNP). To support it, geographic information system and remote
   sensing can be applied to develop a fire vulnerability map. The object
   of the research was to develop fire vulnerability map, based on
   bio-physical and human disturbance factors. The map was based on the
   local bio-physical condition, namely land cover, vegetation index,
   moisture index, and land surface temperature. Human disturbance was
   determined based on distance, namely center of community activities, and
   distance from accessibilities. After the variables were scored and
   weighted, the overlaid map presents the locations with high, medium, and
   low vulnerability classes. The validation of the model was done using
   the forest fire occurrence point data. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {Given the need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   due to the production of electricity, countries worldwide are trying to
   develop and implement different energy saving strategies and
   technologies to mitigate global warming. A core part of achieving this
   is the development and implementation of renewable energy technologies
   such as wind.
   This has resulted in the development and innovation of wind turbines
   with output ranges of 10-15MW likely to be deployed by 2020. This
   increased output has a knock on effect on the growth of rotor diameters
   and tower heights requiring the wind turbine system to be assessed from
   an economic, environmental and structural performance viewpoint. This
   has led to the proposal of using concrete as an alternative to the
   current preference of steel for wind turbine towers due to a number of
   limiting issues.
   Thus, the main focus of this paper is to investigate and compare the
   life cycle emissions (LCE) of GHG of concrete relative to steel as a
   tower solution in order to identify a solution for both onshore and
   offshore facilities. The main findings indicated that the LCE for a wind
   turbine with a concrete tower range between 4-9\% lower than its
   equivalent steel solution over a 40 year life cycle.},

Abstract = {In April 2018, the International Maritime Organisation adopted an
   ambitious plan to contribute to the global efforts to reduce the
   Greenhouse Gas emissions, as set by the Paris Agreement, by targeting a
   50\% reduction in shipping's Green House Gas emissions by 2050,
   benchmarked to 2008 levels. To meet these challenging goals, the
   maritime industry must introduce environmentally friendly fuels with
   negligible, or low SOX, NOX and CO2 emissions. Ammonia use in maritime
   applications is considered promising, due to its high energy density,
   low flammability, easy storage and low production cost. Moreover,
   ammonia can be used as fuel in a variety of propulsors such as fuel
   cells and can be produced from renewable sources. As a result, ammonia
   can be used as a versatile marine fuel, exploiting the existing
   infrastructure, and having zero SOX and CO2 emissions. However, there
   are several challenges to overcome for ammonia to become a compelling
   fuel towards the decarbonisation of shipping. Such factors include the
   selection of the appropriate ammonia-fuelled power generator, the
   selection of the appropriate system safety assessment tool, and
   mitigating measures to address the hazards of ammonia. This paper
   discusses the state-of-the-art of ammonia fuelled fuel cells for marine
   applications and presents their potential, and challenges.},

Abstract = {Climate change has received much attention during the last decennium and
   especially various mitigation and adaptation strategies. Particularly
   the coastal zone will feel the consequences of climate change and the
   associated effects like sea level rise, increased storminess and
   flooding. Thus there is an urgent need for local and regional spatial
   planners to include climate change in their planning efforts. Using
   modelling and simulation, we can increase our understanding of the
   future land-use system under influence of a changing climate and
   accordingly reduce uncertainty concerning decisions. The current paper
   describes how land-use simulations combined with climate change
   scenarios represented by the SRES narratives can facilitate the
   definition of adaptation strategies to counteract the consequences of
   potential climate changes.},

Title = {Analyzing adaptation strategies to climate change followed by the

Abstract = {Climate change has been recognized, globally, as the most pressing
   critical issue affecting, adversely, survival of the mankind in the
   twenty-first century. The continuous rise of the sea-level due to global
   warming is likely to have a devastating impact on the Sundarbans,
   a'World Heritage Site',deltaic complex, albeit highly prone to extreme
   and/or adverse climatic events including disasters. Accordingly, keeping
   in view this issue, the present study was designed to understand the
   multi-criterion decision-making ability vis-a-vis adoption of different
   adaptation strategies among the farming community of the Indian
   Sundarbans. A total of 120 farmers, who were growing crops, rearing
   livestock, apart from being involved in fisheries, simultaneously, were
   selected from 5 blocks of the Indian Sundarbans. The study revealed 19
   adaptation strategies followed by the farmers of the said locality.
   Further, to trace the best adaptation strategy, Analytical Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) was used. Based on the intensity of importance of one
   adaptation strategy over another, the most substantial one was found to
   be ``Practicing of Integrated Farming System{''}.},

   of Coastal Residential Construction},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Hurricane-induced coastal floods pose a significant threat to near-shore
   communities for the United States and many other coastal areas around
   the world. Various mitigation measures have been developed to reduce
   infrastructure vulnerability. This paper proposes an engineering-based
   method to evaluate the influence of different flood mitigation
   strategies on residential structural vulnerability. The mitigation
   strategies studied are floor elevation, the elevation of utilities, wet
   floodproofing, and dry floodproofing. A probabilistic damage and cost
   analysis of building components is employed to modify existing fragility
   functions of unmitigated structures. The coastal flood fragility
   functions are then translated into vulnerability functions to express
   the mean damage ratio as a function of the hazard intensity, reflecting
   the influence of the mitigation measures. To evaluate the effectiveness
   of the strategy, the mitigated results are compared with the
   vulnerability functions of unmitigated residential structures. The
   proposed method is designed to incorporate independent calibration data
   from damage assessments readily and claims analyses and provides a
   useful tool to help decision-makers assess coastal flood mitigation
   measures on a quantitative basis.},

Title = {Shipping emissions in a Nordic port: Assessment of mitigation strategies},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {205-216},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We use a bottom-up approach to develop a comprehensive emissions
   inventory for the Port of Oslo for current and future scenarios,
   including compliance with environmental legislation. We estimate the
   emission of air pollutants (NOx, PM10, SO2) and greenhouse gases (GHGs;
   CO2, CH4, N2O) from shipping and land activities in the port. The
   inventory shows that oceangoing vessels are the main contributor,
   providing 63-78\% of the total NOx, PM10, SO2 and CO2e emissions. The
   main contributors among oceangoing vessels are international ferries,
   cruises and container vessels, and the main contributors to emissions
   among harbour vessels are domestic ferries. We estimate the emissions
   from oceangoing vessels for different operational modes, obtaining the
   highest values at berth followed by emissions during vessel manoeuvres.
   We evaluate a 2020 scenario that takes account of (i) the expected
   increase in maritime traffic; (ii) compliance with a new regulation
   regarding sulphur content in ship fuel (<0.1\%); and (iii)
   implementation of various mitigation measures. These measures include
   implementation of onshore power, and its combination with a speed
   reduction zone in the port, and the increase use of liquid natural gas
   (LNG). The results show that compliance with regulation provides a
   reduction of 90\% and 10\% in SO2 and PM10 emissions, respectively.
   Onshore power in combination with a speed reduction zone provides
   reductions of up to 15\% in NOx and CO2 emissions by 2020 compared with
   2013, and further reductions of up to 23\% (NOx) and 17\% (CO2e) if we
   extend the use of LNG among domestic ferries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {329-335},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {China's energy saving at the provincial level has important policy
   implications for the mitigation of the greenhouse gas emissions in the
   world. Therefore, this study uncovers the driving forces of the changes
   of the provincial energy consumption by distinguishing the domestic and
   interregional trade based on the MRIO-based SDA technique for the period
   of 1997-2011. We find that (1) final demand per capita was the top
   determinant of the increments in provincial energy consumption, while
   both energy intensity and production structure offset the provincial
   energy changes; (2) most of 30 provinces were outsourcers due to the
   close interprovincial linkages; (3) product flows from utility and raw
   materials of upstream resource-dependent provinces were supplied to the
   coastal provinces, which are the manufacturing hubs. This implies policy
   making for the reduction of provincial energy in China should
   simultaneously implement measures on production-side and
   consumption-side. This is even more important when considering the
   embodied energy due to the interprovincial linkages within China.},

Title = {Ecosystem Carbon Stock and Stable Isotopic Signatures of Soil Organic
   Carbon Sources Across the Mangrove Ecosystems of Kerala, Southern India},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems have high carbon storage and sequestration rates and
   become substantial sources of greenhouse gases when disturbed by
   land-use change. Thus, they are extremely valuable for inclusion in
   climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. However in Kerala,
   a west coast state of India, has lost 95\% of its mangroves in the last
   three decades, posing a serious threat to global climate. The regional
   carbon stock data of mangroves that are at risk of depletion are rarely
   reported, despite the fact that they are crucial for mitigating and
   managing climate change impacts. In response, the study estimated the
   ecosystem carbon stocks and soil organic carbon sources of three
   different estuarine mangrove habitats of Kerala. The mean total
   ecosystem carbon stock of Kerala mangroves was estimated to be 218.98
   +/- 169.86 Mg C ha(- 1) which is equivalent to 803.66 +/- 621.47 Mg CO2
   ha(- 1), contributing a substantial amount of carbon to the global
   ecosystem carbon. Further 88\% of the estimated ecosystem carbon stock
   was represented by vegetation biomass and 22\% by the soil carbon stock.
   The stable isotopic signatures revealed that the accumulated
   autochthonous mangrove source attributed to the organic carbon in the
   soils of site 1 (Munroe island) and site 3 (Vypin) while the suspended
   organic matter in tidal water contributed to the soil organic carbon of
   site 2 (Ayiramthengu) mangroves. Mangrove structure, salinity, soil pH
   and bulk density were found to be the correlating factors for the carbon
   stock variations across the study sites. Hence, the understanding of the
   amount of carbon stocks in the mangroves of Kerala coupled with other
   ecosystem services they offer highlights their importance in the
   creation of conservation, restoration and climate change mitigation
   plans in the country.},

Title = {Prioritizing climate change adaptation options for iconic marine species},

Abstract = {Adaptation options in response to climate impact scenarios for marine
   mammals and seabirds were developed based on the IPCC vulnerability
   framework. Under this framework, vulnerability to the physical effects
   of climate change can be reduced by adaptation options that reduce
   exposure of individuals, reduce the sensitivity of individuals, and
   increase the adaptive capacity of individual/species to cope with
   climate change. We evaluated options in each vulnerability category with
   three screening tools collectively forming an approach we term
   sequential adaptation prioritization for species. These tools were
   designed to evaluate (i) technical aspects (cost-benefit-risk, CBR),
   (ii) institutional barriers, and (iii) potential social acceptability.
   The CBR tool identified which adaptation options were high cost and low
   benefit, might be discarded, and which were high benefit and low cost,
   might be rapidly implemented (depending on risk). Low cost and low
   benefit options might not be pursued, while those that are high cost,
   but high benefit deserve further attention. Even with technical merit,
   adaptation options can fail because of institutional problems with
   implementation. The second evaluation tool, based on the conceptual
   framework on barriers to effective climate adaptation, identifies where
   barriers may exist, and leads to strategies for overcoming them.
   Finally, adaptation options may not be acceptable to society at large,
   or resisted by vocal opponents or groups. The social acceptability tool
   identifies potentially contested options, which may be useful to
   managers charged with implementing adaptation options. Social
   acceptability, as scored by experts, differed from acceptability scored
   by the public, indicating the need to involve the public in assessing
   this aspect. Scores from each tool for each scenario can be combined to
   rank the suite of adaptation options. This approach provides useful
   tools to assist conservation managers in selecting from a wide range of
   adaptation strategies; the methodology is also applicable to other
   conservation sectors.},

Title = {Coping with crisis on the coast: The effect of community-developed
   coping-strategies on vulnerability in crisis-prone regions of the Ganges
   delta},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {284},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Coastal communities are prone to crises. Repeated exposure to crises
   constrains the ability of residents to access basic needs such as
   health, water and food, and may increase their vulnerability levels. In
   response, communities develop coping strategies such as depoldering
   (temporary breaching of embankments for TRM: tidal rivers management)
   and anti-aquaculture movements. However, existing research has not
   adequately explored the relationship between coping strategies and
   vulnerability. Theoretical literature is characterized by ambiguity on
   how various geocentric and anthropocentric factors affect vulnerability
   in the presence of community-developed coping strategies. Therefore, to
   advance theoretical knowledge in this field, this article first
   conceptualizes an integrated framework on the association between
   vulnerability and coping strategies by merging anthropocentric and
   geocentric approaches. It then uses mixed methods drawn from social
   science (surveys, semi-structured interviews), geography (spatial tools)
   and statistics (multiple regression) on data collected from the coastal
   belt of Bangladesh to demonstrate that coping strategies may have an
   effect on vulnerability in crisis-prone coastal regions. The
   significance of this study is that it demonstrates how the association
   between vulnera-bility and coping strategies is likely to be nuanced:
   depending on a) the type of vulnerability (food/water/ health), and b)
   the coping strategy (TRM vs. anti-aquaculture movements). Different
   coping strategies are associated with different kinds of vulnerability
   and these relationships depend on local context (other anthropocentric
   and geocentric variables). Community movements against aquaculture could
   reduce food vulnerability, whereas TRM may reduce water vulnerability.
   Reduction in health vulnerability may instead be associated with
   urbanization and infrastructure development.},

Title = {Incorporating climate change adaptation into marine protected area
   planning},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Pages = {3251-3267},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly impacting marine protected areas (MPAs)
   and MPA networks, yet adaptation strategies are rarely incorporated into
   MPA design and management plans according to the primary scientific
   literature. Here we review the state of knowledge for adapting existing
   and future MPAs to climate change and synthesize case studies (n = 27)
   of how marine conservation planning can respond to shifting
   environmental conditions. First, we derive a generalized conservation
   planning framework based on five published frameworks that incorporate
   climate change adaptation to inform MPA design. We then summarize
   examples from the scientific literature to assess how conservation goals
   were defined, vulnerability assessments performed and adaptation
   strategies incorporated into the design and management of existing or
   new MPAs. Our analysis revealed that 82\% of real-world examples of
   climate change adaptation in MPA planning derive from tropical reefs,
   highlighting the need for research in other ecosystems and habitat
   types. We found contrasting recommendations for adaptation strategies at
   the planning stage, either focusing only on climate refugia, or aiming
   for representative protection of areas encompassing the full range of
   expected climate change impacts. Recommendations for MPA management were
   more unified and focused on adaptative management approaches. Lastly, we
   evaluate common barriers to adopting climate change adaptation
   strategies based on reviewing studies which conducted interviews with
   MPA managers and other conservation practitioners. This highlights a
   lack of scientific studies evaluating different adaptation strategies
   and shortcomings in current governance structures as two major barriers,
   and we discuss how these could be overcome. Our review provides a
   comprehensive synthesis of planning frameworks, case studies, adaptation
   strategies and management actions which can inform a more coordinated
   global effort to adapt existing and future MPA networks to continued
   climate change.},

Title = {Evaluation of Adaptation Practices in the Agriculture Sector of
   Bangladesh: An Ecosystem Based Assessment},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate changes imposed differential impacts on Bangladesh in the form
   of sea level rise, extreme events, and variability, which has enormous
   economic, environmental and social cost. Such impacts are assorted
   across the ecosystems of the Southwest, Northwest and Central region of
   the country. Among the different sectors, agriculture is comparatively
   more vulnerable to climate change impacts. In order to reduce the
   climate change induced loss and damage, a series of adaptation options
   have been being practiced by the people at the local level for many
   years, but the effectiveness, profitability, and sustainability of such
   adaptation options are still not too well investigated or understood.
   From this backdrop, the study intends to identify, prioritize and
   evaluate the adaptation options in the agriculture of different
   ecosystems of Bangladesh. It is found that the economic gain of adopting
   rice prawn farming, replantation of rice, and saline tolerant and short
   duration rice varieties are much higher than the other adaption options.
   Through investing \$10 in such adaptation options, \$22, \$4, \$2 and
   \$2 net return will be provided, respectively. Unavailability and less
   affordability are impeding the promotion of some effective adaption
   options, which require more attention from policy makers, while further
   research, demonstration and capacity building of the farmers will reduce
   vulnerability and build resilience.},

Booktitle = {CLIMATE ADAPTATION MODELLING},
Series = {Springer Climate},
Year = {2022},
Pages = {59-66},
Abstract = {Coastal storms often cause damages and losses in occupied areas. Under
   climate change conditions (i.e. sea-level rise and increased frequency
   of extreme sea levels) and increasing human occupation, the consequences
   of coastal storms will be amplified if no adaptation actions are
   implemented. The selection of the best possible coastal management
   measures to reduce risks at coastal areas, considering costs,
   effectiveness and acceptance, will be mandatory in the future. This work
   presents a generic approach to model disaster risk reduction measures at
   coastal areas, including climate change effects. The proposed
   methodology is adaptable to any coastal region and can be used to test
   (and improve) management options at a broad number of coastal areas. It
   can also be used to define a timeframe for the implementation of the
   defined measures since not all risk reduction measures, under a climate
   change scenario, need to be implemented at the same time. This would
   help to optimise implementation costs while reducing the risk to the
   occupation and people.},

Abstract = {Prioritizing climate change mitigation measures could help to identify
   most feasible or most nationally appropriated mitigation actions. This
   process can also provide important inputs for the development of
   national climate change strategies or policies. The paper applies Delphi
   method to prioritize criteria for potential climate change mitigation
   technology in the metallurgical sector in Vietnam. The consultation
   process has been done with ten experts in only two cycle to reach
   Kendall (W) value over 0.5. Then, 11 out of 21 criteria have been
   selected for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in prioritizing
   mitigation options in iron and steel, lead, zinc, tin and aluminium
   productions. Mitigation options with highest scores will be proposed for
   mitigation target of the metallurgical sector which could be inputs for
   NDC of industrial sector. The selected criteria include 01 indicator in
   emission reduction (GPT1), 01 indicator in environmental impacts (MT1),
   01 indicators in social impacts (XH3), 02 indicators in economic impacts
   (KT1, KT2), 02 indicators in sustainable development impacts (PTBV1,
   PTBV2) and 04 indicators in MRV (MRV1, MRV2, MRV3, MRV4).},

Title = {An Integrated, Probabilistic Modeling Approach to Assess the Evolution
   of Barrier-Island Systems Over the Twenty-First Century},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Barrier-island systems, spanning similar to 7\% of the world's
   coastlines, are of great importance to society because not only they
   provide attractive, liveable space for coastal communities but also act
   as the first line of defense from coastal storms. As many of these
   unique coastal systems are affected by both oceanic and terrestrial
   processes, it is necessary to consider the holistic behavior of
   applicable terrestrial and coastal processes when investigating their
   evolution under plausible future scenarios for climate change,
   population growth and human activities. Such holistic assessments, also
   accounting for uncertainties, can readily be achieved via
   reduced-complexity modeling techniques, owing to their much faster
   simulation times compared to sophisticated process-based models. Here,
   we develop and demonstrate a novel probabilistic modeling framework to
   obtain stochastic projections of barrier-island evolution over the
   twenty-first century while accounting for relevant oceanic and
   terrestrial processes under climate change impacts and anthropogenic
   activities. The model is here demonstrated at the Chandeleur islands
   (Louisiana, United States) under the four Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas emission scenarios (i.e.,
   Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) with
   results indicating that there are significant uncertainties in projected
   end-century barrier-island migration distance and available barrier
   freeboard under the high emission scenario RCP 8.5. The range of
   uncertainties in these projections underscores the value of stochastic
   projections in supporting the development of effective adaptation
   strategies for these fragile coastal systems.},

Title = {An Economical Energy Management Strategy for Viable Microgrid Modes},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the last couple of decades, numerous energy management strategies
   have been devised to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emission,
   hence introducing the concept of microgrids. In a microgrid, distributed
   energy generators are used. Microgrid enables a point which ameliorates
   in exchanging power with the main grid during different times of day.
   Based on the system constraints, in this work, we aim to efficiently
   minimize the operating cost of the microgrid and shave the power
   consumption peaks. For this purpose, we introduce an improved binary bat
   (iBBat) algorithm which helps to schedule the load demand of smart homes
   and energy generation from distributed generator of microgrid to the
   load demand and supply. The proposed energy management algorithm is
   applied to both grid-connected and islanded modes of the microgrid. The
   constraints imposed on the algorithm ensure that the load of electricity
   consumer does not escalate during peak hours. The simulation results are
   compared with BBat and binary flower pollination algorithm, which
   validate that the iBBat reflects substantial reduction in operating cost
   of microgrid. Moreover, results also show a phenomenal reduction in the
   peak-to-average ratio of load demand from main the main grid.},

Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {360},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Following the surging demand for sustainable biofuels, biogas production
   via anaerobic digestion (AD) presented itself as a solution for energy
   security, waste management, and greenhouse gas mitigation. Algal-based
   biorefinery platform serves an important role in the AD-based
   closed-loop circular economy. Other than using whole biomass of micro-
   and macroalgae as feedstock for biogas production, the integration of AD
   with other bio- or thermochemical conversion techniques can achieve
   complete valorization of biomass residue after processing or valuable
   compounds extraction. On the other hand, anaerobic digestate, the
   byproduct of AD processes can be used for microalgal cultivation for
   lipid and pigments accumulation, closing the loop of resource flow.
   Furthermore, algae and its consortium with bacteria or fungi can be
   employed for combined biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment.
   Innovative strategies have been developed to enhance biogas upgrading
   and pollutant removal performance as well as minimize O2 and N2 content
   in the upgraded biomethane.},

Journal = {NATURE SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {332-338},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Wind power is often posed as a greenhouse gas emission mitigation
   option, yet from a global perspective, the constrained supplies of
   rare-earth metals required for large-scale offshore wind turbines seem
   increasingly likely to provide limits to offshore wind power and other
   rare-earth-metal applications in the coming years. A 2015 US Department
   of Energy study maps an ambitious roadmap for offshore wind power to be
   capable of meeting substantial US electric-generating capacity by 2050.
   Our study addresses the neodymium material requirements that would be
   needed. We find that regional differences in deployment schedules will
   result in complex patterns of new capacity additions occurring
   concomitantly with turbine retirements and replacement needs. These
   demands would total over 15.5 Gg (15.5 kt) of neodymium by 2050, of
   which 20\% could potentially be avoided by circular usage from
   decommissioned turbines but only if recycling technologies are developed
   or, better still, magnets are designed for reuse. Because neodymium is
   deemed to be a `critical material', these perspectives are vital
   information for the formation of policy related to wind-energy
   provisioning, to domestic production, and to the importation of the
   rare-earth elements that would be required.},

Title = {Resilience-based steps for adaptive co-management of Arctic small-scale
   fisheries},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Arctic small-scale fisheries are essential for the livelihoods,
   cultures, nutrition, economy, and food security of Indigenous
   communities. Their sustainable management in the rapidly changing Arctic
   is thus a key priority. Fisheries management in complex systems such as
   the Arctic would benefit from integrative approaches that explicitly
   seek to build resilience. Yet, resilience is rarely articulated as an
   explicit goal of Arctic fisheries management. Here, we first describe
   how marine and anadromous fisheries management throughout the North has
   used the notion of resilience through a literature review of 72
   peer-reviewed articles. Second, we make a conceptual contribution in the
   form of steps to implement adaptive co-management that aim to foster
   resilience. Building on resilience-based insights from the literature
   review and foundational research on adaptive co-management and
   resilience, the steps we propose are to initiate and carry out (1)
   dialogue through a discussion forum, (2) place-based social-ecological
   participatory research, (3) resilience-building management actions, (4)
   collaborative monitoring, and (5) joint process evaluation.
   Additionally, we propose action items associated with the steps to put
   adaptive co-management into practice. Third, we assess two case studies,
   Cambridge Bay and Pangnirtung Arctic Char commercial fisheries, to
   explore how the five steps can help reinforce resilience through
   adaptive co-management. Overall, we propose novel guidelines for
   implementing adaptive co-management that actively seeks to build
   resilience within fishery social-ecological systems in times of rapid,
   uncertain, and complex environmental change.},

Abstract = {The coastal ecosystems of temperate North America provide a variety of
   ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Yet,
   little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in
   the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem
   carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal
   wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity
   gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the
   entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased
   along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for
   seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low
   marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for
   tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted
   for >98\% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78\% in the
   tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for
   only 48\%-53\% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34\% of the
   TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to
   a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and
   potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large
   carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the
   conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through
   climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that
   long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased
   porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the
   absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.},

Abstract = {Climate change and sea-level rise due to human emissions of greenhouse
   gases is expected to accelerate through the 21(st) Century. Even given
   substantial reductions in these emissions, sea-level rise will probably
   be significant through the 21(st) Century and beyond. This poses a major
   challenge to long-term coastal management. While Europe has a high
   adaptive capacity, climate change will produce problems that have not
   been faced previously, and solutions need to be reconciled with the
   wider goals of coastal management. A recent European Survey of the
   current response to sea-level rise and climate change shows a few
   countries engaged in proactive planning, while most are ignoring the
   issue, or only beginning to recognise its significance. While a
   proactive response should minimise the actual impacts and need for
   reactive responses, ignoring sea-level rise and climate change will
   almost certainly increase vulnerability.
   A common theme that emerges is the need for more impact and
   vulnerability assessment that is relevant to coastal management needs.
   This should include the consequences of sea-level rise and climate
   change on coastal areas from the local to the European scale. This will
   require continued development of broad-scale assessment methods for
   coastal management. It is also important to assess coastal adaptation
   and management as a process rather than just focus on the implementation
   of technical measures. Lastly, the uncertainties of climate change
   suggest that management should have explicit goals, so that the success
   or failure of their achievement should be regularly monitored and the
   management approach adjusted as appropriate.},

Title = {A framework for identifying and selecting long term adaptation policy
   directions for deltas},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {633},
Pages = {946-957},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Deltas are precarious environments experiencing significant biophysical,
   and socio-economic changes with the ebb and flow of seasons (including
   with floods and drought), with infrastructural developments (such as
   dikes and polders), with the movement of people, and as a result of
   climate and environmental variability and change. Decisions are being
   taken about the future of deltas and about the provision of adaptation
   investment to enable people and the environment to respond to the
   changing climate and related changes. The paper presents a framework to
   identify options for, and trade-offs between, long term adaptation
   strategies in deltas. Using a three step process, we: (1) identify
   current policy-led adaptations actions in deltas by conducting
   literature searches on current observable adaptations, potential
   transformational adaptations and government policy; (2) develop
   narratives of future adaptation policy directions that take into account
   investment cost of adaptation and the extent to which significant policy
   change/political effort is required; and (3) explore trade-offs that
   occur within each policy direction using a subjective weighting process
   developed during a collaborative expert workshop. We conclude that the
   process of developing policy directions for adaptation can assist policy
   makers in scoping the spectrum of options that exist, while enabling
   them to consider their own willingness to make significant policy
   changes within the delta and to initiate transformative change. (C) 2018

Title = {Benefit transfer of climate change adaptation policies in island tourist
   destinations},
Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Benefit transfer is a non-market valuation method that offers a quick
   and cost effective alternative to costly valuation methods for assessing
   the economic value of environmental goods and policies in tourism. This
   paper assesses the validity of the benefits transfer method for the
   policies to adapt to climate change impacts across tourist destinations.
   To do so, a discrete choice experiment is designed and conducted
   simultaneously across seven island destinations with similar
   sociological and environmental characteristics. The results show some
   climate change adaptation policies are more valued than others by
   tourists, and some destinations attract higher preferences for
   environmental actions. The tests give significant support to the
   validity of the transfer of benefits of adaptation policies across
   destinations, thereby providing an alternative for the economic
   assessment of the benefits of non-market goods and climate change
   adaptation policies in tourism, as worldwide information about the costs
   and benefits involved in tourism policy decision making become
   increasingly available.},

Abstract = {Tropical wetland ecosystems, especially mangroves and peatlands, are
   carbon-rich ecosystems that should be considered to be part of climate

   southeast Asia. Emission factors and activity data are among the most
   important components to carry out credible assessment. In this article,
   we explore and discuss emission factors and activity data in light of
   project development and national reporting using the upcoming IPCC
   methodologies for wetlands. Country-specific data are needed to reduce
   uncertainties and hence enhance the projects competitiveness. There are
   opportunities to improve local livelihoods through mitigation strategies
   in wetlands. Potential bundling with adaptation measures is also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are directly affected by climate change-induced

   this qualitative investigation is to know the adaptation practices of
   the coastal community in response to climate change-induced tidal
   inundation. This study used the PRISMA statement (Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses) method and selected 19 relevant publications. This
   systematic review identified four categories of adaptation practices
   that the coastal community practise in response to climate
   change-induced tidal inundation, e.g., traditional knowledge practices
   (three sub-categories), social and community practices (four
   sub-categories), mechanical practices (five sub-categories), and
   institutional responses (two sub-categories). Results will be useful to
   the coastal planners, policymakers, researchers and mass people.},

   carbon (OC), primarily in their sediments. Across habitat types and
   regions, however, information about the sequestration rates and sources
   of carbon to local sediments remains sparse. Here we compiled recently
   obtained estimates of sediment OC stocks and sequestration rates from
   139 cores collected from temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows in
   Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Across all cores
   sediment OC content averaged 0.75\%. Organic carbon stocks in the top 25
   cm and 1 m of the sediment averaged 1,846 and 7,168 g OC m(-2),
   respectively. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 4.6 to 93.0 g OCm-2
   y(r-1) and averaged 24.8 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). Isotopic data from this
   region suggest that OC in the sediments is largely from noneelgrass
   sources. In general, these values are comparable to those from other
   temperate Z. marina meadows, but significantly lower than previously
   reported values for seagrasses globally. These results further highlight
   the need for local and species-level quantification of blue carbon
   parameters. While temperate eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store
   as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere, climate policy incentives
   should still be implemented to protect existing sediment carbon stocks
   and the other critical ecosystem services associated with eelgrass
   habitats.},

Abstract = {In California, there have been numerous policy directives aimed at
   mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2005, Executive Order
   S-3-05 established three target reduction levels for GHG emissions for
   the state, most notably a return to 1990 levels by 2020 (codified into
   law by the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) and a reduction to 80
   percent below 1990 levels by 2050. In 2006, Senate Bill 1368 mandated a
   GHG emission performance standard (set at an interim level of 1100
   lb-CO2/MWh or 500 kg-CO2/MWh) for new or renewed long-term contracts to
   purchase electricity from baseload facilities, and Assembly Bill 1925
   required a report to the California legislature containing
   recommendations for accelerating the adoption of cost-effective geologic
   sequestration strategies for the long-term management of industrial
   carbon dioxide. Assembly Bill 1925 provided a unique opportunity for
   technical experts and other stakeholders to inform future policy
   decisions and regulations for geologic carbon sequestration in
   California. The author of the bill, the state agencies, and other
   stakeholders involved in developing the report agreed that a two-stage
   process would best address the goals of the legislation. A first report
   was recently released that provides a thorough overview of carbon
   capture and sequestration (CCS) fundamentals in a California context and
   recommends areas for additional data acquisition or analyses. A second
   report, to be issued in 2010, will contain a full set of recommendations
   based on further studies, stakeholder input, and data and lessons
   learned from ongoing geologic CCS projects worldwide and particularly
   from field tests in California conducted by the West Coast Regional
   Carbon Sequestration Partnership (WESTCARB). This paper presents an
   overview of the approach and key findings of the first report, including
   technical readiness, infrastructure needs, regulatory and economic
   assessments, identification of potential early opportunities for
   application of CCS technology, and assessment of the greatest barriers
   to widespread CCS adoption in the state. Many of these findings are
   generally applicable beyond California or provide analogs useful to
   other states. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved},

Abstract = {Under present growth rates of greenhouse gas and black carbon aerosol
   emissions, global mean temperatures can warm by as much as 2 degrees C
   from pre-industrial temperatures by about 2050(1,2). Mitigation of the
   four short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), methane, tropospheric
   ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and black carbon, has been shown to reduce the
   warming trend by about 50\% (refs 1,2) by 2050. Here we focus on the
   potential impact of this SLCP mitigation on global sea-level rise (SLR).
   The temperature projections under various SLCP scenarios simulated by an
   energy-balance climate model(1) are integrated with a semi-empirical SLR
   model(3), derived from past trends in temperatures and SLR, to simulate
   future trends in SLR. A coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model(4) is
   also used to estimate SLR trends due to just the ocean thermal
   expansion. Our results show that SLCP mitigation can have significant
   effects on SLR. It can decrease the SLR rate by 24-50\% and reduce the
   cumulative SLR by 22-42\% by 2100. If the SLCP mitigation is delayed by
   25 years, the warming from pre-industrial temperature exceeds 2 degrees
   C by 2050 and the impact of mitigation actions on SLR is reduced by
   about a third.},

Abstract = {Various climate adaptation strategies are being studied for the
   agricultural sector to address the effects of climate change. Global
   warming is predicted to have a significant influence on cool-season
   grass production in Japan in terms of decreasing grass dry matter yield.
   The authors have studied adaptation strategies to maintain grass dry
   matter yield using orchardgrass, a cool-season grass. However, it may be
   difficult to adapt to future climate conditions using management methods
   such as fertilizer application or changing grassland renovation cycles
   using only one grass species. In this study, a model was constructed
   formulating the relationship between temperature and yields of the main
   cool-season grasses in Japan, and the effects of global warming on grass
   productivity were predicted. Two models were constructed, and the
   optimal one was selected using Akaike's information criterion. The
   selected model was then validated using correlations with observation
   data. We also compared areas suitable for cultivation at current and
   higher temperatures, which were produced as maps using the selected
   model. Bahiagrass, which is a warm-season grass, was suitable for
   cultivation in coastal areas in southern Kanto under increased
   temperature condition. It may be useful, therefore, to convert to
   heat-resistant grasses, such as orchardgrass or tall fescue, as
   temperatures rise.},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas (GHG) and its
   atmospheric concentration is currently 50\% higher than pre-industrial
   levels. The continuous GHGs emissions may lead to severe and
   irreversible consequences in the climate system. The reduction of GHG
   emissions may be not enough to mitigate climate change. Consequently,
   besides carbon capture from large emission sources, atmospheric CO2
   capture may be also required. To meet the target defined for climate
   change mitigation, the removal of 10 Gt.yr(-1) of CO2 globally by
   mid-century and 20 Gt.yr(-1) of CO2 globally by the end of century. The
   technologies applied with this aim are known as negative emission
   technologies (NETs), as they lead to achieve a negative balance of
   carbon in atmosphere. This paper aims to present the recent research
   works regarding NETs, focusing the research findings achieved by
   academic groups and projects. Besides several advantages, NETs present
   high operational cost and its scale-up should be tested to know the real
   effect on climate change mitigation. With current knowledge, no single
   process should be seen as a solution. Research efforts should be
   performed to evaluate and reduce NETs costs and environmental impact.

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation Strategies for Canadian Asphalt Pavements;
   Part 1: Adaptation strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {363},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {There is strong evidence for climate change leading to a rise in
   temperatures and a change in precipitation trends. These environmental
   changes pose a threat to pavement infrastructure worldwide. Therefore,
   it is necessary to modify pavement design procedures to consider climate
   change. In addition, it is necessary to consider suitable pavement
   materials for future climate. The objective of this study is to develop
   a framework for selecting an appropriate adaptation strategy to mitigate
   climate change impact. To fulfill this, the influence of climate change
   on long-term pavement performance in Canada has been quantified over
   sixteen Canadian pavement sections located over various provinces in
   Canada. In addition, the fundamental causes of pavement deterioration
   due to climate change were determined using ten different climate change
   models. Various adaptation strategies such as upgrading asphalt binder
   grade, increasing the thickness of asphaltic concrete layer, increasing
   the base layer thickness, and using stabilized base layers were analyzed
   to reduce pavement deterioration and to extend the service life of the
   pavement. Unlike the other studies, pavement temperatures were
   determined using Enhanced Integrated Climate Model (EICM) to determine
   the change in binder grade for the future climate in the adap-tation
   process. The study found that by 2070 all examined locations will
   require an upgrade in binder grade and the majority will require an
   upgrade in mixture gradation. Furthermore, the east and west coast will
   be more vulnerable to climate change and require additional measures in
   comparison to Central Canada. Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island are
   the only locations that will need to consider a change in asphalt
   thickness while British Columbia is the only location eventually
   requiring a stabilized base. This study emphasizes the necessity of
   climate change adaptation strategies for Canadian asphaltic concrete
   pavements.},

Title = {Coping with the impacts of urban heat islands. A literature based study
   on understanding urban heat vulnerability and the need for resilience in
   cities in a global climate change context},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {171},
Pages = {1140-1149},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon whereby temperature levels
   in urban areas are higher than in surrounding rural settings. Urban heat
   islands are a matter of increasing concern, since they can affect
   communities by exacerbating air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
   (due to the greater use of air conditioning) and the occurrence of
   heat-related illness, and may lead to higher levels of mortality. This
   paper provides a description of the phenomena of (UHI) and an analysis
   of how cities are vulnerable to it. It highlights the need for
   resilience and the variety of means by which the UHI can be tackled. It
   describes a set of trends in two regions in Germany and Australia, which
   illustrate the scope of the problem in the northern and southern
   hemispheres, and the scale of vulnerability. Then, existing UHI
   vulnerability assessments are analysed to highlight common features and
   differences. Based on this, we propose a classification of adaptability
   parameters to support vulnerability assessments. The paper also
   discusses current mitigation approaches mentioned in the literature, and
   how these address some vulnerabilities. It concludes that both a better
   understanding of the UHI phenomena and consideration of the particular
   context of each city is needed to make urban areas more resilient to
   UHI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Insights from Testing a Modified Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways
   Approach for Spatial Planning at the Municipal Level},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach has successfully
   been used to manage uncertainties in large infrastructure projects.
   However, the viability of the DAPP approach for spatial planning in
   smaller municipal settings is not clear. This paper examines
   opportunities and constraints of using adaptive pathways approaches to
   help small municipalities plan for future sea-level rise. The
   methodology was based on developing a simplified DAPP-approach, which
   was tested in a multiple experimental case study of spatial planning
   projects in three municipalities in Sweden. The results show that the
   approach promoted vulnerability-based thinking among the end-users and
   generated new ideas on how to manage the uncertain long-term impacts of
   future sea-level rise. However, the increased understanding of
   uncertainties was used to justify static, rather than adaptive,
   solutions. This somewhat surprising outcome can be explained by
   perceived legal constraints, lack of experience of adaptive pathways,
   and unwillingness to prescribe actions that could prove difficult to
   enforce in the future. More research is needed to further understand at
   what planning phases dynamic policy pathway approaches work best and how
   current barriers in legislation, practices, mind-set, organization, and
   resources can be overcome.},

Title = {Effect of sea level extremes on the western Basque coast during the 21st
   century},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {237-248},
Abstract = {Rising global sea level increases the vulnerability of coastal regions
   to storm surge flooding. The impact of extreme high waters resulting
   from the combination of tidal oscillations and changes in mean sea level
   and in storm surges during the 21st century has been explored in the
   Bizkaian coast (northern Spain). Mean sea level variations due to
   temperature changes were estimated from an ensemble mean of global
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation models in the Bay of Biscay under
   A1B and A2 climate change scenarios. Changes in the frequency and
   intensity of storm surges were obtained from the output of a barotropic
   regional ocean model forced by greenhouse gas concentrations during
   2000-2100. The storm surge model was calibrated using available tide
   gauge observations. Based on the above estimations, return levels of
   total sea level extremes are expected to increase by up to 40 cm with
   respect to present-day values. The likely impacts of resulting floods on
   coastal and estuarine habitats of the Bizkaian coast were assessed
   applying the return levels to a high precision light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) based Digital Terrain Model. Results show that during
   the second half of the 21st century up to 202 ha are under risk of
   flooding, of which 50\% correspond to urbanized land including
   industrial and residential areas. This represents a more than 3-fold
   increase compared to the area at risk from present sea level extremes.
   This study provides insight into both regional sea level variability and
   local flood-risks, and thus provides inputs for the formulation of
   effective mid-term adaptation measures to sea level extremes.},

Title = {Assessment of household-level adaptation strategies to water stress in

Journal = {WATER POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1516-1540},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite the growing emphasis and global initiatives to ensure safe
   drinking water and sanitation for all (Sustainable Development Goal 6),
   households in the coastal area are at risk of growing water stress
   across the globe. However, little is known about households' adaptation
   strategies to water stress in the coastal area. This study explores the
   determinants and impacts of adaptation strategies to household-level
   water stress (both drinking and non-drinking), considering the behaviors
   of adopters and non-adopters in the southwestern coastal area of
   Bangladesh. We applied an endogenous switching regression model by
   analyzing questionnaire survey datasets (n =502) to estimate the effect
   of adopting adaptation strategies on household-level water stress in
   eight saline-prone coastal districts of Bangladesh. Results reveal six
   commonly-practiced adaptation strategies: reducing vegetable production,
   reducing livestock production, paying more to access water, increasing
   time for water collection, preserving water, and using reservoirs to
   collect water. Determinants such as migration, support from government
   and non-government agencies, age, gender, literacy, occupation, income,
   access to tube wells, and distance from drinking water sources play a
   significant role in adopting adaptation strategies. Results from the
   endogenous switching regression model denote that adopting all six
   adaptation strategies appears to significantly reduce household-level
   water stress. Through counter-factual analysis, results demonstrate
   that, on average, households that did not adopt adaptation strategies
   would have encountered less water stress if they had. Therefore,
   determinants that stimulate adaptation strategies will indirectly reduce
   household water stress.},

Abstract = {Societal adaptation to climate change requires measures that
   simultaneously reduce poverty, protect or restore biodiversity and
   ecosystem services, and remove atmospheric greenhouse gases.
   Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is the type of adaptation
   that aims to combine these outcomes and is particularly relevant to
   developing nations that safeguard most of the planetary biodiversity and
   healthy ecosystems. Although conceptually new, ecosystem-based
   adaptation is fastly gaining traction both as a research arena and as an
   integrated policy instrument. This paper aims to revisit this concept
   and to discuss the science and policy challenges faced by it. It argues
   that ecosystem-based adaptation is a policy mix that promotes adaptive
   transition, which is a step towards sustainability transitions. It faces
   two major challenges in promoting transitions towards adaptation and
   sustainability. First, research on ecosystem-based adaptation mostly
   takes place within the socio-ecological systems framework, which is
   often carried out in isolation from socio-technical systems research. It
   is widely recognized that both types of research should be integrated,
   for the benefit of science and policy-making, and the paper discusses
   the potential of ecosystem-based adaptation in providing such bridge.
   Second, there is a divide between global and local research and policy,
   while at local level this divide is related to the setting (e.g.,
   coastal, urban, rural). The resulting mosaic of information lacks
   integration, which hinders scalability of actions and policies. Finally,
   I examine the opportunity for ecological and conservation scientists to
   interact with social, economic and political scientists on
   ecosystem-based adaptation research, and discuss how timely this
   opportunity is for Brazil. (C) 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia

Title = {Sensitivity study of optimal CO2 emission paths using a simplified
   structural integrated assessment model (SIAM)},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {345-386},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A structurally highly simplified globally integrated coupled
   climate-economic costs model SIAM (Structural Integrated Assessment
   Model) is used to compute optimal paths of global CO2 emissions that
   minimize the net sum of climate damage and mitigation costs. The model
   is used to study the sensitivity of the computed optimal emission paths
   with respect to various critical input assumptions. The climate module
   is represented by a linearized impulse-response model calibrated against
   a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation climate model and a
   three-dimensional global carbon-cycle model. The cost terms are
   represented by strongly simplified expressions designed for maximal
   transparency with respect to sensitive input assumptions. These include
   the discount rates for mitigation and damage costs, the inertia of the
   socio-economic system, and the dependence of climate damages on the
   change in temperature and the rate of change of temperature. Different
   assumptions regarding these parameters are believed to be the cause of
   the marked divergences of existing cost-benefit analyses based on more
   sophisticated economic models.
   The long memory of the climate system implies that very long time
   horizons of several hundred years need to be considered to optimize CO2
   emissions on time scales relevant for a policy of sustainable
   development. Cost-benefit analyses over shorter time scales of a century
   or two can lead to dangerous underestimates of the long term climatic
   impact of increasing greenhouse-gas emissions. To avert a major long
   term global warming, CO2 emissions need to be reduced ultimately to very
   low levels. However, the draw-down can be realized as a gradual
   transition process over many decades and even centuries. This should
   nevertheless not be interpreted as providing a time cushion for
   inaction: the transition becomes more costly the longer the necessary
   mitigation policies are delayed. However, the long time horizon provides
   adequate flexibility for later adjustments. Short term energy
   conservation alone is insufficient and can be viewed only as a useful
   measure in support of the necessary long term transition to carbon-free
   energy technologies. For standard climate damage cost expressions,
   optimal emission paths limiting long term global warming to acceptable
   sustainable development levels are recovered only if climate damage
   costs are not significantly discounted. Discounting of climate damages
   at normal economic rates yields emission paths that are only weakly
   reduced relative to business as usual scenarios, resulting in high
   global warming levels that are incompatible with the generally accepted
   requirements of sustainable development. The solutions are nevertheless
   logically consistent with the underlying discounting assumption, namely
   that the occurrence of global warming damages in the distant future as a
   result of present human activities is of negligible concern today. It
   follows that a commitment to long term sustainable development, if it in
   fact exists, should be expressed by an intertemporal relation for the
   value of the earth's future climate which does not degrade significantly
   over the time horizon relevant for climate change. Since the future
   climate is a common assett whose value cannot be determined on the
   market, the appropriate discount rate for future climate damages should
   be determined by an assessment of the public willingness to pay today
   for the mitigation of future climate change.
   To translate our general conclusions into quantitative cost estimates
   required by decision makers, the present exploratory study needs to be
   extended using more detailed disaggregated climate damage and mitigation
   cast estimates and more realistic socioeconomic models, including
   multi-actor interactions, inherent variability, the role of uncertainty
   and adaptive control strategies.},

Abstract = {The development of adaptive policies for the management of dynamic and
   complex ecosystems, such as marine and coastal environments, asks for
   flexible and innovative tools which account for multifaceted issues,
   uncertainties and cope with a wide range of future conditions. To date,
   several tools and methods to support the design and implementation of
   adaptive policies have been developed by the research community (e.g.
   data processing and management, stakeholder analysis and participatory
   methods, numerical and simulation models, assessment approaches). The
   paper proposes a (four) step-wise methodology to review, analyze,
   classify and select existing tools dealing with social, economic and
   environmental issues. Firstly, existing toolboxes were retrieved.
   Secondly, an in-depth analysis was performed to classify their potential
   for the development and implementation of adaptive policies in marine
   areas. Thirdly, selected tools were included in the `Database of tools
   and methods' of the wider Adaptive Marine Policy Tool Box, designed
   within the EU-FP7 PERSEUS project (Policy-oriented Environmental
   Research in Southern European Seas) to support policy makers with the
   application of an Adaptive Policy Framework. Finally, a review process
   was performed based on several qualitative criteria and expert judgment,
   which allowed to identify a set of valuable `flag tools' useful to
   implement each step of the Adaptive Policy Framework.},

Abstract = {Enriching soil carbon storage is regarded as a viable option for
   mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the agricultural sector.
   Carbon sequestration by applying biomass into the soil can be an
   effective sequestration pathway for agriculture. Biochar, charcoal
   produced from biomass pyrolysis, is highly stable against microbial
   decomposition, and applying this to farmland has the potential to
   mitigate GHG emissions. However, CO2 is emitted throughout the biochar
   life cycle, including pyrolysis, transportation, and farmland
   application. Therefore, estimating the net carbon sequestration
   potential by considering these CO2 emissions is important. To this end,
   operational data from a pilot sugarcane bagasse carbonisation plant were
   collected, and the net carbon sequestration potential with farmland
   application of bagasse charcoal was calculated using inventory data from
   the pilot plant. The results were as follows: (i) kerosene consumption
   during the carbonisation process was the greatest contributor to CO2
   emissions within the life cycle of applying bagasse charcoal to
   farmland; (ii) the initial dryness of the feedstock was an important
   factor in estimating net carbon sequestration potentials; (iii) the CO2
   mitigation potential with farmland application of bagasse charcoal on
   Miyako Island would be 1200-1800 t CO2/year.},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {53-66},

Abstract = {This paper reviews recent literature concerning effects of climate
   change on agriculture and its agricultural adaptation strategies,
   climate change impacts on Chepang communities and their maize farming.
   Climate change is perhaps the most serious environmental threat to
   agricultural productivity. Change in temperature and precipitation
   specially has greater influence on crop growth and productivity and most
   of these effect are found to be adverse. Climate change has been great
   global threat with global temperature rise by 0.83 degrees C and global
   sea level rise by 0.19 m. Poor countries of the world are more
   vulnerable to changing climate due to different technological,
   institutional and resource constraints. In context of Nepal, practices
   like tree plantation, lowering numbers of livestock, shifting to off
   farm activities, sloping agricultural land technology (SALT) and
   shifting cultivation are most common coping strategies. Chepang, one of
   the most backward indigenous ethnic groups of Nepal are also found to
   perceive change in the climate. Perception and adaptation strategies
   followed by different farmers of world including Chepang is mainly found
   to be effected by household head's age, size of farm, family size,
   assessment to credit, information and extension service, training
   received and transportation. Maize is second most important crop in
   Nepal in which increase in temperature is favorable in Mountain and its
   yield is negatively influenced by increase in summer rain and maximum
   temperature. Local knowledge of indigenous people provides new insights
   into the phenomenon that has not yet been scientifically researched. So,
   government should combine this perceptive with scientific climate
   scenario and should conduct activities in term of adoption strategies
   and policies to insist targeted and marginalized farmers.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {461-470},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study investigates how technological transitions across
   California's power sector have shifted its state-level carbon dioxide
   emissions and cooling water consumption intensities. Its ultimate goal
   is to evaluate how the state's climate mitigation and environmental
   policies have affected the power sector's vulnerability to extreme
   drought and how extreme drought has affected progress towards the states
   climate mitigation priorities. The study analyzes the period spanning
   2010-2016, which includes one of the states most severe droughts on
   record. The results indicate that the growth of variable renewable
   energy generation has helped offset some of the negative consequences of
   drought, which include increased emissions and cooling water usage by
   natural gas generators during periods of low hydropower. However, the
   retirement of the San Onofre nuclear power plant has delayed the overall
   decarbonization of the states power sector, and the closure of
   significant coastal power plant capacity could increase the freshwater
   consumption of the power sector if replacement capacity is not cooled
   with alternative cooling water sources or dry cooling systems. The noted
   tradeoffs between greenhouse gas mitigation priorities, freshwater
   dependency, and vulnerability to climatic events highlight the
   importance of holistic decision making as regional power grids
   transition to cleaner generation sources.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {3, SI},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change increases the vulnerability of low-lying coastal areas.
   Careful spatial planning can reduce this vulnerability, provided that
   decision-makers have insight into the costs and benefits of adaptation
   options. This paper addresses the question which adaptation options are
   suitable, from an economic perspective, to adapt spatial planning to
   climate change at a regional scale. We apply social cost-benefit
   analysis to assess the net benefits of adaptation options that deal with
   the impacts of climate change-induced extreme events. From the methods
   applied and results obtained, we also aim at learning lessons for
   assessing climate adaptation options. The case study area, the
   Zuidplaspolder, is a large-scale urban development project in the
   Netherlands. The costs as well as the primary and secondary benefits of
   adaptation options relating to spatial planning (e.g. flood-proof
   housing and adjusted infrastructure) are identified and where possible
   quantified. Our results show that three adaptation options are not
   efficient investments, as the investment costs exceed the benefits of
   avoided damages. When we focus on `climate proofing' the total area of
   the Zuidplaspolder, when the costs and benefits of all the presented
   adaptation options are considered together, the total package has a
   positive net present value. The study shows that it is possible to
   anticipate climate change impacts and assess the costs and benefits of
   adjusting spatial planning. We have learned that scenario studies
   provide a useful tool but that decision-making under climate change
   uncertainty also requires insight into the probabilities of occurrence
   of weather extremes in the future.},

   scientific information on what adaption strategies do farmers across
   different socio-economic and regional strata choose to cope with
   disasters can help policymakers to make informed farm-level support

   adaptation strategy choices of farmers in Odisha have not been much
   studied in the literature. Along with identifying the most commonly
   adopted ex ante and ex post adaptation strategies of farmers, we also
   identified the common factors influencing the choice of these adaptation
   strategies. We used the Likert scale and the ordered probit model to
   analyse the primary data collected from the field survey conducted at
   the three selected coastal districts. It finds that migration, reduction
   in food consumption, and pest and disease management are the most common
   ex post strategies, whereas stocking of foodgrains and usage of
   flood-resistant seeds are the most common ex ante strategies adopted by
   the farmers. It also identifies that education, family size and the size
   of landholding are the main determinants of ex post adaptation
   strategies, whereas age, the size of landholding and family income are
   the major determinants of ex ante coping strategies.},

Title = {High-Resolution Solar Climate Atlas for Greece under Climate Change
   Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In the context of climate change and growing energy demand, solar
   technologies are considered promising solutions to mitigate Greenhouse
   Gas (GHG) emissions and support sustainable adaptation. In Greece, solar
   power is the second major renewable energy, constituting an increasingly
   important component of the future low-carbon energy portfolio. In this
   work, we propose the use of a high-resolution regional climate model
   (Weather Research and Forecasting model, WRF) to generate a solar
   climate atlas for the near-term climatological future under the
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The
   model is set up with a 5 x 5 km(2)spatial resolution, forced by the
   ERA-INTERIM for the historic (1980-2004) period and by the EC-EARTH
   General Circulation Models (GCM) for the future (2020-2044). Results
   reaffirm the high quality of solar energy potential in Greece and
   highlight the ability of the WRF model to produce a highly reliable
   future climate solar atlas. Projected changes between the annual
   historic and future RCPs scenarios indicate changes of the annual Global
   Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) in the range of +/- 5.0\%. Seasonal analysis
   of the GHI values indicates percentage changes in the range of +/- 12\%
   for both scenarios, with winter exhibiting the highest seasonal
   increases in the order of 10\%, and autumn the largest decreases.
   Clear-sky fraction f(clear)projects increases in the range of +/- 4.0\%
   in eastern and north continental Greece in the future, while most of the
   Greek marine areas might expect above 220 clear-sky days per year.},

Title = {Denitrification: An Important Pathway for Nitrous Oxide Production in
   Tropical Mangrove Sediments (Goa, India)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1507-1516},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Net nitrous oxide production and denitrification activity were measured
   in two mangrove ecosystems of Goa, India. The relatively pristine site
   Tuvem was compared to Divan which is prone to high nutrient input
   Stratified sampling at 2-cm intervals within the 0- to 10-cm depth range
   showed that N2O production at both the locations decreased with depth
   Elevated denitrification activity at Divar resulted in maximum
   production of up to 1 95 nmol N2O-N g(-1) h(-1) at 2 to 4 cm. which was
   three times higher than at Tuvem Detailed investigations to understand
   the nut or pathway contributing to N2O production performed at Tuvem
   showed that Incomplete denitrification was responsible for up to 43 to
   93\% of N2O production. Nitrous oxide production rates closely con
   elated to nitrite concentration (n = 15, = 0 47, p < 0 05) and
   denitrifier abundance (r = 0.55, p < 0 05), suggesting that nitrite
   utilization by microbial activity leads to N2O production Nitrous oxide
   production through nitrification was below detection, affirming that
   denitrification is the major pathway responsible for production of the
   greenhouse gas. Net N2O production in these mangrove systems are
   comparatively higher than those reported from other natural estuarine
   sediments and therefore warrant mitigation measures},

Title = {Large-scale distribution of tuna species in a warming ocean},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2043-2060},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Tuna are globally distributed species of major commercial importance and
   some tuna species are a major source of protein in many countries. Tuna
   are characterized by dynamic distribution patterns that respond to
   climate variability and long-term change. Here, we investigated the
   effect of environmental conditions on the worldwide distribution and
   relative abundance of six tuna species between 1958 and 2004 and
   estimated the expected end-of-the-century changes based on a
   high-greenhouse gas concentration scenario (RCP8.5). We created species
   distribution models using a long-term Japanese longline fishery dataset
   and two-step generalized additive models. Over the historical period,
   suitable habitats shifted poleward for 20 out of 22 tuna stocks, based
   on their gravity centre (GC) and/or one of their distribution limits. On
   average, tuna habitat distribution limits have shifted poleward 6.5 km
   per decade in the northern hemisphere and 5.5 km per decade in the
   southern hemisphere. Larger tuna distribution shifts and changes in
   abundance are expected in the future, especially by the
   end-of-the-century (2080-2099). Temperate tunas (albacore, Atlantic
   bluefin, and southern bluefin) and the tropical bigeye tuna are expected
   to decline in the tropics and shift poleward. In contrast, skipjack and
   yellowfin tunas are projected to become more abundant in tropical areas
   as well as in most coastal countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ).
   These results provide global information on the potential effects of
   climate change in tuna populations and can assist countries seeking to
   minimize these effects via adaptive management.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Climate change does not only affect the global and national settings but
   also significantly disturbs households and individuals in the community,
   particularly the female-headed households. Consequently, this study
   aimed to analyse the adaptive capacity and adaptation practices to
   climate change impacts of female headed households in the coastal
   communities of Lagonoy, Camarines Sur, Philippines. A quantitative
   method following causal-comparative and correlational research designs
   was employed in this study. Applying the multistage sampling technique,
   162 out of 281female-headed households from the east and north coastal
   communities of Lagonoy comprised the study respondents. Results revealed
   that the female-headed households' capacities are moderately to highly
   adaptive as far as their economic and social resources are concerned.
   However, they are less to moderately adaptive in terms of their
   institutional and human resources. Further, the respondents have well
   strategised local adaptation practices or knowledge before, during and
   after the onslaught of natural calamities. This study also revealed a
   significant relationship between the respondents' adaptive capacity and
   adaptation practices from the two remote coastal communities. The
   adaptation practices during and after the onslaught of the natural
   disaster, educational attainment, and number of working household
   members are some of the factors that affect their adaptive capacity to
   climate change impacts. It is highly recommended that the national
   government, through the directive of policy makers, establish specific
   social protection programs by integrating the ecological and
   gender-sensitive framework.},

Title = {Review of some effects of climate change on indoor environmental quality
   and health and associated no-regrets mitigation measures},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {70-80},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the potential health consequences of changes in
   climate that affect indoor environments, with an emphasis on residential
   environments in the U.S. and Europe. These changes in climate, include
   increases in the frequency and severity of heat waves, severe storms
   coupled with sea level rise, and wildfires, plus increases in urban
   airborne ozone. The potential for adverse health effects is substantial.
   Examples of projected effects include a doubling of heat-related deaths,
   increased hospitalizations for asthma, pneumonia, and cardiovascular
   effects during wildfires, and increased mortality and hospitalizations
   associated with ozone. The associated adverse exposures occur, to a
   significant extent, indoors. The adverse health effects will be
   substantially mediated by features of buildings, particularly of homes
   where people, particularly those most susceptible, spend the largest
   amount of time. Changes to buildings, or to building operations, are
   identified that could reduce the projected adverse health effects of
   climate change. Examples include improved roof insulation, roof coatings
   that reflect more solar energy, and more air conditioning to reduce
   indoor overheating. Improved particle filtration systems could reduce
   the health effects of particles from wildfires. Some of these measures
   will also reduce building energy use and the associated emissions of
   greenhouse gases. Most of these measures would improve health
   irrespective of climate change. Improvements in building energy
   efficiency in order to mitigate climate change, has to potential to
   either improve or worsen indoor environmental quality and health. (C)

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Many regions in Europe are vulnerable to climate change impacts and
   these have already been observed in many human and natural systems.
   There is therefore a need for all European countries to adapt to climate
   change. However, climate change does not pose a threat at all levels of
   change, nor in a similar way across all economic sectors and regions.
   Impacts of climate change vary by region, with the Mediterranean basin,
   north western and central-eastern Europe, and the Arctic, together with
   many coastal zones and other areas prone to river floods, mountains, and
   cities being particularly vulnerable. Consequently, adaptation options
   have to be tailor-made to local geographic conditions in terms of
   vulnerable landscape types and sectors involved. This is why European
   and national adaptation strategies must be complemented by regional
   approaches that address implementation issues at this scale. The
   European Union (EU) Adaptation White Paper together with national and
   regional adaptation strategies provide key steps toward European
   frameworks for adaptation measures and policies to strengthen resilience
   to climate change impacts. Monitoring and evaluation methods must be
   further developed, so that adaptation practices can be assessed across
   time and space. A preliminary set of success factors and barriers to
   adaptation is also important to identify and assess the determinants of
   good practices and assist stakeholders in developing robust adaptation
   strategies that can make Europe more resilient to climate change.
   Potential conflicts, synergies, and trade-offs between adaptation and
   mitigation have also to be identified early in the decision-making
   process, and adaptation and mitigation efforts should be coordinated.},

Abstract = {This study examined the post-disaster adaptation since 2009 of a fishing
   harbor Linbian in southern Taiwan. This study found that locals have
   developed adaptation plans different from the expert planning after
   participating in the call for adaptation action plans, technology actant
   inventions, and decision-making with locally inherited wisdom to
   re-define action plans for climate change adaptation. Local adaptation
   actions responding to climate change not only require the involvement of
   local knowledge covering history, culture, and the environment, but also
   needs modern knowledge capital similar to community building and public
   affair participation experiences to stimulate each other, accomplish one
   another's goals, and empower mobilization, thus bringing locale-specific
   characteristics, and creating value for local actions.},

Title = {Tropical Forest Landscape Restoration in Indonesia: A Review},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Indonesia has the second-largest biodiversity of any country in the
   world. Deforestation and forest degradation have caused a range of
   environmental issues, including habitat degradation and loss of
   biodiversity, deterioration of water quality and quantity, air
   pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to
   climate change. Forest restoration at the landscape level has been
   conducted to balance ecological integrity and human well-being. Forest
   restoration efforts are also aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and are
   closely related to Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
   from the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the
   regulatory, institutional, and policy aspects of forest restoration in
   Indonesia, as well as the implementation of forest restoration
   activities in the country. The article was written using a synoptic
   review approach to Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR)-related articles
   and national experiences. Failures, success stories, and criteria and
   indicators for forest restoration success are all discussed. We also
   discuss the latest silvicultural techniques for the success of the
   forest restoration program. Restoration governance in Indonesia has
   focused on the wetland ecosystem such as peatlands and mangroves, but
   due to the severely degraded condition of many forests, the government
   has by necessity opted for active restoration involving the planting and
   establishment of livelihood options. The government has adapted its
   restoration approach from the early focus on ecological restoration to
   more forest landscape restoration, which recognizes that involving the
   local community in restoration activities is critical for the success of
   forest restoration.},

Abstract = {Adaptation is an important approach for protecting human health,
   ecosystems, and economic systems from the risks posed by climate
   variability and change, and for exploiting beneficial opportunities
   provided by a changing climate. This paper presents 9 fundamental
   principles that should be considered when designing adaptation policy,
   for example, a sound understanding of the potential regional effects of
   climate on human and ecological systems is required to target
   appropriate investments in adaptive responses. The distribution of
   potential impacts across different populations and the mechanisms by
   which these impacts occur are also key to effective adaptation measures.
   Options for coping with climatic changes must be considered in the
   context of multiple stressors. Further, adaptation is likely to exhibit
   varying levels of effectiveness as demonstrated by current efforts to
   deal with climate variability. Potential adverse side effects of
   adaptive strategies must also be accounted for to avoid solutions that
   are worse than the problem. These issues and others are presented in
   this paper, with examples from various impacts studies to illustrate key
   points.},

Title = {Why is coastal retreat so hard to implement? Understanding the political
   risk of coastal adaptation pathways},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {107-114},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coastal climate adaptation, as a response to managing the increasing
   risk of inundation of coastal settlements and infrastructure, is a
   global challenge. As a result, there is a burgeoning body of studies
   recommending adaptation options, pathways and strategies generated by
   the research and increasingly private consulting sector. However, recent
   reviews of global adaptation performance repeatedly highlight a lack of
   implementation of many adaptation studies and plans. It is suggested
   here that one of the reasons why many coastal adaptation plans have not
   been applied is due to inadequate consideration of the political risk,
   underpinned by lack of consideration of potential allocation and
   distributional impacts of adaptation strategies. The work presented here
   identifies the political risk of the most common coastal adaptation
   pathways and approaches ('retreat', `protect' and `manage'). This work
   especially highlights the major political risk of pre-emptive planned
   retreat adaptation strategies, which may seem the most obvious
   adaptation approach from the perspective of minimising future risks to
   settlements and infrastructure. However, it carries the largest
   political risk and potential distributional impacts, which is likely to
   hinder the adoption of this adaptation strategy in the short term. (C)

Abstract = {Being one of the most vulnerable regions in the world, the
   Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta presents a major challenge for climate
   change adaptation of nearly 200 million inhabitants. It is often
   considered as a delta mostly exposed to sea-level rise and exacerbated
   by land subsidence, even if the local vertical land movement rates
   remain uncertain. Here, we reconstruct the water-level (WL) changes over
   1968 to 2012, using an unprecedented set of 101 water-level gauges
   across the delta. Over the last 45 y, WL in the delta increased slightly
   faster (similar to 3 mm/y), than global mean sea level (similar to 2
   mm/y). However, from 2005 onward, we observe an acceleration in the WL
   rise in the west of the delta. The interannual WL fluctuations are
   strongly modulated by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian
   Ocean Dipole (IOD) variability, with WL lower than average by 30 to 60
   cm during co-occurrent El Nino and positive IOD events and
   higher-than-average WL, by 16 to 35 cm, during La Nina years. Using
   satellite altimetry and WL reconstructions, we estimate that the maximum
   expected rates of delta subsidence during 1993 to 2012 range from 1 to 7
   mm/y. By 2100, even under a greenhouse gas emission mitigation scenario
   (Representative Concentration Pathway {[}RCP] 4.5), the subsidence could
   double the projected sea-level rise, making it reach 85 to 140 cm across
   the delta. This study provides a robust regional estimate of
   contemporary relative WL changes in the delta induced by continental
   freshwater dynamics, vertical land motion, and sea-level rise, giving a
   basis for developing climate mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Enhanced CO2 sequestration based on hydrate technology with pressure
   oscillation in porous medium using NMR},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {252},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a dominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere that
   contributes to global warming. A promising approach to mitigate CO2
   emissions is CO2 capture and storage (CCS) through clathrate hydrate
   crystallization under the seafloor; however, numerous issues regarding
   the mechanisms of concentration, efficiency, and stability of CO2
   hydrate sequestration in seafloor sediments remain under dispute. This
   study employed low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements
   to observe the in-situ formation of CO2 hydrate using the pressure
   oscillation method in porous media and evaluate the carbon sequestration
   efficiency. Our results indicate that CO2 hydrates are preferentially
   formed in large pore spaces, further hindering the subsequent gas
   contact with water in isolated pores. Additionally, a high initial water
   saturation is more conducive to high-quantity CO2 hydrate capture and
   sequestration in a pressure variation environment with a higher driving
   force. The proposed pressure oscillation method could effectively break
   the mass transfer barriers in the later stage of hydrate formation with
   the help of CO2 solubility fluctuations, significantly increase the rate
   of later hydrate formation, and shorten the period of hydrate
   sequestration.(C)2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Global climate change is a change in the long-term weather patterns that
   characterize the regions of the world. Scientists state unequivocally
   that the earth is warming. Natural climate variability alone cannot
   explain this trend. Human activities, especially the burning of coal and
   oil, have warmed the earth by dramatically increasing the concentrations
   of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. The more of these gases humans
   put into the atmosphere, the more the earth will warm in the decades and
   centuries ahead. The impacts of warming can already be observed in many
   places, from rising sea levels to melting snow and ice to changing
   weather patterns. Climate change is already affecting ecosystems,
   freshwater supplies, and human health. Although climate change cannot be
   avoided entirely, the most severe impacts of climate change can be
   avoided by substantially reducing the amount of heat-trapping gases
   released into the atmosphere. However, the time available for beginning
   serious action to avoid severe global consequences is growing short.
   This paper reviews assessing of such climate change impacts on various
   components of the ecosystem such as air, water, plants, animals and
   human beings, with special emphasis on economy. The most daunting
   problem of global warming is also discussed. This paper, further reviews
   the mitigation measures, with a special focus on carbon sequestration
   and clean development mechanism (CDM). The importance of synergy between
   climate change mitigation and adaptation has been discussed. An overview
   of the relationship between economy and emissions, including Carbon Tax
   and Emission Trading and the policies are also presented. (C) 2011

Title = {Climate change, ocean processes and ocean iron fertilization},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {364},
Pages = {219-225},
Abstract = {Observations indicate that the rate of increase in concentration of
   atmospheric CO2 is increasing faster than projected in any of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios.
   Several mitigation measures, referred to as `geoengineering options',
   have been proposed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To be successful,
   such a mitigation operation must remove `significant' CO2 from the
   atmosphere for many decades, be verifiable, and not cause deleterious
   side effects. One option, purposeful addition of iron to fertilize
   photosynthetic uptake Of CO2 by phytoplankton in regions of the ocean
   where iron is a limiting nutrient, has received considerable scientific
   attention. In the last 15 yr, a dozen small-scale open ocean iron
   fertilization experiments have been performed and a succession of models
   of large-scale fertilization have been developed. As successive models
   have become more realistic, the amounts Of CO2 forecast to be
   sequestered have dropped, and in all cases are small relative to the
   amounts Of CO2 projected to be released through fossil fuel burning over
   the next century for any of the IPCC emission scenarios. Possible side
   effects include a long term reduction in ocean productivity, alteration
   of the structure of marine food webs, and a more rapid increase in ocean
   acidity. Most importantly, increased remineralization associated with
   the increased downward export of organic carbon particles would result:
   in increased production of the third most important long-lived
   greenhouse gas, N2O. The magnitude of this effect is poorly known.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Increasing demand for metals used in clean energy technologies,
   including electric vehicles, has led to an increased demand in certain
   metals such as Ni, Co, and Mn. This demand has in turn led to an
   expanding interest in deep-seabed mining (DSM) of polymetallic nodule
   deposits that contain these exact metals. The main concerns about DSM
   relate to the incomplete information available about the environmental
   risks associated with seabed mineral extraction. Key uncertainties need
   to be systematically addressed to refine environmental impact
   predictions and establish effective mitigation measures. Adaptive
   management is an iterative process for reducing the uncertainty that can
   be applied by both mining companies and regulatory bodies. This Special
   Series paper reviews the key opportunities and challenges to
   operationalizing adaptive management in DSM projects and highlights the
   need for a framework to move from theory to practice. The discussion
   proposes a systems approach to adaptive management, which could help to
   guide the environmental management of deep-sea mineral extraction.

Title = {Past and future adaptation pathways},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-44},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Adaptation pathways are increasingly being used as a foresight tool to
   help guide the implementation of climate change adaptation and
   deliberate transformation. This paper applies a pathways lens as a
   hindsight tool to provide new understanding about past change and
   adaptation relevant for improving future adaptation pathways approaches.
   Four case studies of past adaptations to change are examined: Solomon
   Islands Communities, Canadian forest-dependent communities, a
   Transylvanian village, and responses to climate adaptation policies in
   Australia. The results highlight that responses to change in these
   diverse case studies involve complex transitions that gradually create
   new conditions and trajectories; manifest as multiple but inter-related
   pathways of change and response at different social or spatial scales
   (e.g. different paths for different households or communities); have
   legacies and continuities across time that affect future pathways of
   change; are affected by power in complex ways; and can create further
   change and need for adaptation. Analyses also highlight that when
   working with prospective adaptation approaches as a response to climate
   change there is a need to consider: (1) underlying assumptions, values
   and principles associated with the future; (2) the existence of
   inter-connected multiple pathways and their implications for reinforcing
   existing social inequalities; and (3) how understanding past change
   provides inspiration for new and transformative futures. Overall, the
   paper concludes that shifts towards analyses for change rather than
   simply about change, such as adaptation pathways, will require more
   careful consideration of underlying ontological assumptions about the
   relationships between past, present and future.},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change on marine capture fisheries have been
   observed in several studies. It is likely to have a substantial effect
   on fishers' income and food security. This study aims to estimate the
   impact of adaptation strategies on fishers' income and their household's
   food security. Data were collected from small-scale fishers' households,
   which own a fishing boat smaller or equal to five gross tonnages (GT).
   The study sites were the two coastal regions of Malang and Probolinggo
   in East Java, Indonesia, due to the meager socioeconomic resources
   caused by climate change. A probit regression model was used to
   determine the factors influencing the fishers' adaptation. Propensity
   score matching (PSM) was applied to evaluate the impact of the
   adaptation strategies on income and food security. Food security was
   measured by food consumption score (FCS). The findings indicated that
   participation in the fishers' group affected adaptation strategies
   significantly, and so did the access to credit and climate information.
   Also, PSM showed that the adaptation strategies had a positive and
   significant impact on fishers' income and food security. Those who
   applied the adaptation strategies had a higher income and FCS than those
   who did not. This finding implies that the fishery sector's adaptation
   strategies can have significant expansion outcome and reduce exposure to
   risks posed by climate change. Therefore, the arrangement of more
   climate change adaptation strategies should be promoted by the
   government for small-scale fishers in Indonesia.},

Abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, emissions of which have vital
   consequences for global climate change. Understanding and quantifying
   the sources (and sinks) of atmospheric methane is integral for climate
   change mitigation and emission reduction strategies, such as those
   outlined in the 2015 UN Paris Agreement on Climate Change. There are
   ongoing international efforts to constrain the global methane budget,
   using a wide variety of measurement platforms across a range of spatial
   and temporal scales. The advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   technology over the past decade have opened up a new avenue for methane
   emission quantification. UAVs can be uniquely equipped to monitor
   natural and anthropogenic emissions at local scales, displaying clear
   advantages in versatility and manoeuvrability relative to other
   platforms. Their use is not without challenge, however: further
   miniaturization of high-performance methane instrumentation is needed to
   fully use the benefits UAVs afford. Developments in the models used to
   simulate atmospheric transport and dispersion across small, local scales
   are also crucial to improved flux accuracy and precision. This paper
   aims to provide an overview of currently available UAV-based
   technologies and sampling methodologies which can be used to quantify
   methane emission fluxes at local scales.This article is part of a
   discussion meeting issue `Rising methane: is warming feeding warming?

Abstract = {In this paper we ponder this question: what types of institutional
   principles would help to establish a macroregional climate change
   adaptation strategy in the Baltic Sea Region? Inspired by a new
   institutionalism approach, we trace some of the important elements of
   regulatory and normative institutional functions. We then discuss how
   top-down and bottom-up government and governance can contribute to a
   macroregional climate change adaptation strategy, and profile the local,
   national, and transnational development efforts that are already
   underway to facilitate coordination and learning about climate change
   adaptation in the Baltic Sea Region. Finally, we look at the specific
   role that a macroregional climate change adaptation strategy has in
   helping to manage institutional complexity inherent in a multilevel
   governance context.},

Title = {Effective mitigation of climate change with sustainable development of
   energy, water and environment systems},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {269},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The urgency of mitigating climate change comes with opportunities to
   transition society towards a more sustainable future. Numerous options
   exist for immediate, deep, and sustained efforts to realise a 43\%
   reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Beyond the recent reports
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this editorial extends
   insight into new research advances for integrated approaches that can
   support effective climate mitigation. Based on the 16th Conference on
   Sustainable Development of Energy, Water, and Environment Systems, the
   review in this editorial interconnects the 28 research articles in this
   special issue within a broader context across eight main themes. The
   first theme on 100\% renewable energy systems emphasizes recent advances
   in modelling and sector coupling, extending to the optimization of
   positive energy districts and energy communities at the local level and
   ultra-low temperature district heating and cooling networks. Energy
   security with sustainable energy solutions involves electrification,
   renewable energy, and energy savings. Transforming transport for energy
   transition solutions and new frontiers in renewable energy technologies
   cover advances for smart energy districts, electric vehicles, accurate
   forecasting of long-term wind speed, hydrogen propulsion in marine
   vessels, and innovations for water quality monitoring. System
   restructuring for the energy transition is supported with research
   contributions on time variability and environmental signalling in
   electricity markets, dedicated price structures for energy community
   trading, flexibilisation, and repurposing drilling sites for deep
   geothermal energy. Thematically, upgrading of biomass for biofuel
   production, green hydrogen innovations and heat transfer as well
   sustainable combustion complete the special issue. New catalysts, hybrid
   reaction for lignocellulosic biofuels, hydrogen fuel cell
   electrocatalyst, and waste heat recovery from granules in concentrating
   solar power or slags are some of the research advances under these
   themes. The widespread upscaling of solutions for mitigating climate
   change requires an effective approach that involves integrated,
   coordinated, and synergistic action now as the only chance for better
   protecting the life-support systems of the planet.},

Title = {Climate change damages to Alaska public infrastructure and the economics

Abstract = {Climate change in the circumpolar region is causing dramatic
   environmental change that is increasing the vulnerability of
   infrastructure. We quantified the economic impacts of climate change on
   Alaska public infrastructure under relatively high and low climate
   forcing scenarios {[}representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)
   and RCP4.5] using an infrastructure model modified to account for unique
   climate impacts at northern latitudes, including near-surface permafrost
   thaw. Additionally, we evaluated how proactive adaptation influenced
   economic impacts on select infrastructure types and developed
   first-order estimates of potential land losses associated with coastal
   erosion and lengthening of the coastal ice-free season for 12
   communities. Cumulative estimated expenses from climate-related damage
   to infrastructure without adaptation measures (hereafter damages) from
   2015 to 2099 totaled \$5.5 billion (2015 dollars, 3\% discount) for
   RCP8.5 and \$4.2 billion for RCP4.5, suggesting that reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions could lessen damages by \$1.3 billion this century. The
   distribution of damages varied across the state, with the largest
   damages projected for the interior and southcentral Alaska. The largest
   source of damages was road flooding caused by increased precipitation
   followed by damages to buildings associated with near-surface permafrost
   thaw. Smaller damages were observed for airports, railroads, and
   pipelines. Proactive adaptation reduced total projected cumulative
   expenditures to \$2.9 billion for RCP8.5 and \$2.3 billion for RCP4.5.
   For road flooding, adaptation provided an annual savings of 80-100\%
   across four study eras. For nearly all infrastructure types and time
   periods evaluated, damages and adaptation costs were larger for RCP8.5
   than RCP4.5. Estimated coastal erosion losses were also larger for
   RCP8.5.},

Title = {Economy-wide effects of coastal flooding due to sea level rise: a
   multi-model simultaneous treatment of mitigation, adaptation, and
   residual impacts},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article presents a multi-model assessment of the macroeconomic
   impacts of coastal flooding due to sea level rise and the respective
   economy-wide implications of adaptation measures for two greenhouse gas
   (GHG) concentration targets, namely the Representative Concentration
   Pathways (RCP)2.6 and RCP4.5, and subsequent temperature increases.
   Wecombine our analysis, focusing on the global level, as well as on
   individual G20 countries, with the corresponding stylized RCP mitigation
   efforts in order to understand the implications of interactions across
   mitigation, adaptation and sea level rise on a macroeconomic level. Our
   global results indicate that until the middle of this century,
   differences in macroeconomic impacts between the two climatic scenarios
   are small, but increase substantially towards the end of the century.
   Moreover, direct economic impacts can be partially absorbed by
   substitution effects in production processes and via international trade
   effects until 2050. By 2100 however, we find that this dynamic no longer
   holds and economy-wide effects become even larger than direct impacts.
   The disturbances of mitigation efforts to the overall economy may in
   some regions and for some scenarios lead to a counterintuitive result,
   namely to GDP losses that are higher in RCP26 than in RCP45, despite
   higher direct coastal damages in the latter scenario. Within the G20,
   our results indicate that China, India and Canada will experience the
   highest macroeconomic impacts, in line with the respective direct
   climatic impacts, with the two first large economies undertaking the
   highest mitigation efforts in a cost-efficient global climate action. A
   sensitivity analysis of varying socioeconomic assumptions highlights the
   role of climate-resilient development as a crucial complement to
   mitigation and adaptation efforts.},

Title = {An Examination of Climate Change on Extreme Heat Events and

Journal = {WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {281-292},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study examines the impact of a changing climate on heat-related
   mortality in 40 large cities in the United States. A synoptic
   climatological procedure, the spatial synoptic classification, is used
   to evaluate present climate-mortality relationships and project how
   potential climate changes might affect these values. Specifically, the
   synoptic classification is combined with downscaled future climate
   projections for the decadal periods of 2020-29, 2045-55, and 2090-99
   from a coupled atmospheric-oceanic general circulation model. The
   results show an increase in excessive heat event (EHE) days and
   increased heat-attributable mortality across the study cities with the
   most pronounced increases projected to occur in the Southeast and
   Northeast. This increase becomes more dramatic toward the end of the
   twenty-first century as the anticipated impact of climate change
   intensifies. The health impact associated with different emissions
   scenarios is also examined. These results suggest that a ``business as
   usual'' approach to greenhouse gas emissions mitigation could result in
   twice as many heat-related deaths by the end of the century than a lower
   emissions scenario. Finally, a comparison of future estimates of
   heat-related mortality during EHEs is presented using algorithms
   developed during two different, although overlapping, time periods, one
   that includes some recent large-scale significant EHE intervention
   strategies (1975-2004), and one without (1975-95). The results suggest
   these public health responses can significantly decrease heat-related
   mortality.},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The increasing of atmospheric CO2, which is considered as a major
   greenhouse gas, plays a crucial role in global warming and climate
   change. In addition to reducing CO2 emissions from anthropogenic
   activities, it is more urgent to actively remove CO2 from the air.
   Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a feasible but high-cost technology
   to remove CO2 from the flue gases of coal-fired power plants. On the
   other hand, CO2 sequestration by biological approaches shows potential
   and has the benefit that the biomass generated from the fixed CO2 can
   then be utilized for other purposes. However, CO2 bio-mitigation
   technology is still under development because the efficiency of CO2
   capture and fixation is too low to be applicable in industry. In this
   study, we enhanced a photobioreactor-based microalgal CO2 mitigation
   system by combining the chemical capture/transformation of CO2 by
   carbonic anhydrase (CA) with the biological fixation of captured CO2 by
   cyanobacteria. We genetically engineered the cyanobacteria to produce
   and secrete CAs in the medium. The secreted CAs efficiently transformed
   dissolved CO2 to HCO3-. And HCO3- was taken up by the cyanobacteria and
   further fixed into biomass through photosynthesis. To our knowledge, we
   have demonstrated for the first time that CO2 can be sequestrated in a
   sustainable way through combining the chemical transformation of CO2
   with the biological CO2 fixation in a microalgal photobioreactor system.},

Title = {Water Quality Management and Climate Change Mitigation:
   Cost-effectiveness of Joint Implementation in the Baltic Sea Region},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {12-26},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper explores the scope for simultaneously managing nutrient
   abatement and climate change mitigation in the Baltic Sea (BS) region
   through the implementation of a selection of measures. The analysis is
   undertaken using a cost-minimisation model for the entire BS region, the
   BALTCOST model. In the present research, the model has been extended to
   include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions effects, enabling us to analyse
   the trade-offs between cost-effective GHG and nutrient load reductions.
   We run the model for four different scenarios in order to compare the
   environmental and economic consequences of contrasting strategies:
   single environmental objective management versus joint implementation
   strategy. The results show that implementing land-based measures with a
   sole focus on water quality (to meet the HELCOM's 2013 Baltic Sea Action
   Plan nutrient abatement targets) can produce climate change mitigation
   co-benefits equivalent to 2.3\% of the 2005 emission level (from
   agriculture and waste water combined) for the entirety of the BS region.
   More interestingly, a joint implementation strategy can deliver further
   climate change mitigation benefit (i.e. up to 5.4\%) at a marginal cost
   that is comparable to mitigation costs reported by other studies for
   efficient technologies. All in all the results demonstrate that a joint
   strategy to improve water quality and to reduce climate change is
   economically beneficial. Our findings show that the cost and the outcome
   of the implementation vary between countries. This illustrates the need
   to develop a joint regional policy for water and climate regulation that
   fully considers the asymmetry in both the expected effects and cost
   distribution across the countries in the region.},

Title = {Factors and practices: farmers' adaptation to climate change in
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Abstract = {Climate literature is pronounced about the impending threat to
   agriculture taking into account the climate change scenario and
   suggesting adaptation as a possible option to opt for. Considering this,
   the study seeks to comprehend the factors influencing farmers'
   adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in coastal Bangladesh
   (Koyra Upazila, Khulna). In order to achieve the objectives,
   descriptive, multivariate, and binary logistic regressions were used to
   analyze the data. Findings demonstrate that the most often used
   adaptation strategies were crop, water, and infrastructure management.
   Regression result shows that factors such as gender, labor in the
   family, farming experience, and the damaged sector are important factors
   in determining how well adaption methods are implemented. Binary
   logistic regression analysis explains that age (p= <= 0.041), income (p
   = <= 0.037), and farm size (p <= 0.005) are significant factors in
   deciding on a new adaption option. The outcomes of this research can be
   used to reevaluate current frameworks and strategies for coping with
   climate change and to identify the factors that influence policy
   formulation. In order to improve the water management system for
   agriculture, policies such as Cash-for-Work (CFW) and Employment
   Generation Programme for the Poorest (EGPP) may be used to boost local
   agriculture.},

Title = {Climate risks and adaptation strategies in the Lower Mekong River basin},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {207-219},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper examines perceived climate risks, their impacts, and existing
   adaptation practices at the local level, including the role of local
   institutions. The analysis focuses on two selected areas in Vietnam and
   Thailand. The paper is based on the information collected through key
   informant interviews at provincial and district level, focus group
   discussions at village level, and household survey. Several adaptation
   practices exist at local level to deal with the perceived risks of
   drought, floods, and salinity intrusion. Most of the adaptation
   practices were autonomous focusing on coping with short-term risks
   rather than structural long-term climate risks. Some adaptation
   practices, such as crop insurance and regulatory measures included in
   the literature and practiced in other places, did not exist at local
   level in the case study countries, but some local practices such as
   farmers' annual fair could be an important addition to the inventory of
   potential adaptation measures. Local institutions have facilitated
   adaptation in different ways. They (1) lead and support unique
   adaptation practices suitable to the local context; (2) act as a
   catalyst to help people to adapt some practices by providing technical
   and material support; and (3) act as the bridge between local people and
   the governmental and non-governmental agencies. But several factors
   constrain the effectiveness of locally practiced adaptation measures.
   Thus, to enhance the adaptive capacity of households and the local
   community, it is necessary to: (1) improve the technical capacity of
   farmers; (2) create effective mechanisms for strengthening, promoting,
   and disseminating locally initiated efforts; (3) subsidize and improve
   access to credit services; (4) improve links between production and
   markets; and (5) establish effective mechanisms for coordination.},

Abstract = {The National 12th Five-Year-Plan for Social and Economic Development
   (2011-2015) (national development policy) in China requires knowledge of

Abstract = {To assess the potential impact of climate changes on pasture production
   in the North Island, New Zealand, eight climate scenarios of increased
   temperature and increased (or decreased) rainfall were investigated by
   integrating a polynomial regression model for pasture production with a
   Geographic Information System (GIS). The results indicated that the
   climate change scenarios assuming an increase in temperature by 1-2
   degrees C and a rainfall change by -20 to +20\% would have a very
   significant impact on pasture production with a predicted pasture
   production variation from -46.2 to +51.9\% compared with the normal
   climate from 1961-1990. Increased temperature would generally have a
   positive effect on pasture production in the south and southeast of the
   North Island, and increased rainfall would have a positive effect in the
   central, south and southeast of the North Island and a negative effect
   in the north of the North Island. The interaction of decreased rainfall
   and increased temperature would have a negative impact for the whole
   North Island except some central areas with high rainfall. Relevant
   management practices for coping with potential climate change are

Year = {2012},

Abstract = {The climate scenarios of the IPCC suggest that adaptation to future
   climate change will be required. The North Sea Region, a marginal sea of
   the Atlantic Ocean between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the
   Netherlands and Belgium, is particularly affected due to rising sea
   level and a changing water balance. Water management plays a key role in
   sustainable management of natural and societal resources. This paper
   presents a participatory study of community approaches to regional
   adaptation to climate change. Water management adaptation options to
   regional climate induced changes until 2050 were developed together with
   stakeholders for the Wesermarsch County (Northern Germany). Available
   information on expected regional climate change and a modelling study on
   hydrological change suggested that adaptation of water management will
   be required until 2050. A regional stakeholder forum formulated a vision
   on how the Wesermarsch should look like in 2050. Following the holistic
   approach of collaborative planning, two stakeholder groups developed an
   adaptation portfolio on how urban and rural areas could adapt their
   water management to cope with the expected changes. Since most of the
   stakeholders do not want the county to undergo significant changes in
   terms of landscape and land use, they proposed technical measures to
   enforce flood protection and enhance the performance of the existing
   water management system. Adaptation in terms of land use change was not
   proposed although information on comparable examples from similar
   regions was available. To justify the proposed adaptation options,
   available information on expected climate change impacts was used
   selectively. Uncertainty in model projections was partly ignored to
   legitimate suggesting inflexible (technical) adaptation measures.
   However, collaborative planning proved to be helpful for a joint
   adaptation to climate change at the regional scale. Stakeholders as well
   as scientists took active part in the participatory learning process as
   required by EU directives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Combined climate impacts and vulnerability index on coastal ecosystems
   in prediction of future scenarios: extended sustainable indicator tool
   for adaptive strategy},

Abstract = {This study presents the coastal vulnerability due to the forecasted
   climate change impact on the marine environment, including the sea level
   rise physical trait of risk impact. A combined methodology using
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which corresponds to the
   greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, is used in this research; combined
   with Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to rank the relative risk
   for each of the marine ecosystem zones in relation to the potential
   hazard exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise. This method
   presents vulnerability in numerical data, which cannot be calculated
   directly based on their physical properties. From the results, it shows
   that the coastal areas of the study area of Marudu Bay would experience
   a warmer atmosphere both under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 with an increment of
   1.0 degrees C and 1.7 degrees C; meanwhile, the climate projection for
   total exhibits of increase in total precipitation by 2.6 mm/day and 1.6.
   mm/day under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 at the regional measure. At the same
   time, the projection simulates an increase of sea level by 0.21 m and
   0.27 m over the northern region of Marudu Bay under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5,
   respectively. In addition, 43.84 ha and 57.02 ha of land estimated would
   be potentially inundated by the mid-century year 2050 under RCP 4.5 and
   RCP 8.5. By the end of the century 2100, the sea level is projected to
   increase locally at about 0.32 m under RCP 4.5 and 0.38 m under RCP 8.5,
   consequently resulting in a total of 66.84 ha and 79.78 ha of additional
   inundation coverage. Therefore, the result from this study can be used
   when making effective adaptive strategies and conservation planning
   despite its inherent uncertainties.},

Abstract = {Implementation of adaptation actions to protect biodiversity is limited
   by uncertainty about the future. One reason for this is the fear of
   making the wrong decisions caused by the myriad future scenarios
   presented to decision-makers. We propose an adaptive management (AM)
   method for optimally managing a population under uncertain and changing
   habitat conditions. Our approach incorporates multiple future scenarios
   and continually learns the best management strategy from observations,
   even as conditions change. We demonstrate the performance of our AM
   approach by applying it to the spatial management of migratory shorebird
   habitats on the East Asian-Australasian flyway, predicted to be severely
   impacted by future sea-level rise. By accounting for non-stationary
   dynamics, our solution protects 25 000 more birds per year than the
   current best stationary approach. Our approach can be applied to many
   ecological systems that require efficient adaptation strategies for an
   uncertain future.},

Title = {Climate-related uncertainties in urban exposure to sea level rise and
   storm surge flooding: a multi-temporal and multi-scenario analysis},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {230-246},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change-induced sea level rise and intensified storms pose
   emerging flood threats to global coastal urban areas. While such threats
   have been mapped, their uncertainties from different climate scenarios
   and longer planning horizons have yet to be addressed from both an
   exposure assessment and a stakeholder outreach perspective. Therefore,
   we chose the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay Area as an example to
   project its flood areas every 20 years between 2000 and 2100, under 24
   varied climate scenarios with two greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration
   levels. We then assessed flood exposure by intersecting the flood areas
   with demographic and socioeconomic distributions, developed areas,
   lifeline infrastructures, and emergency responders in low elevation ( <
   10 m) coastal zones. Our median estimates under the low GHG scenarios
   indicated that 10-38\% of the items assessed above are flood-exposed in
   2000-2020, with this exposure increasing to 20-54\% during 2080-2100.
   The median estimates under the high GHG scenarios for the same periods
   are 0-35\% and 40-67\%, respectively. The expected uncertainties, or
   standard deviations, of the exposures for a given item assessed above
   under the low and high GHG scenarios are 1-2\% in 2000-2020 and 7-10\%
   in 2080-2100. Despite our modeling capability for a range of climate
   scenarios over the long term, some stakeholders, particularly those in
   the private sector, prefer near-term results with lower uncertainties.
   This implies the need for coastal urban areas to cope with
   climate-related uncertainties and to focus on the long term when
   developing strategies and policies for climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Framing the application of Adaptation Pathways for agroforestry in

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Adaptation Pathways is a decision support tool designed to create
   adaptation policies under different climate change scenarios. This tool
   has been used successfully in several sectors and contexts such as
   coastal and river adaptation, urban heat waves, floods and rural
   livelihoods but its use in natural resource management, has faced
   several challenges and limitations. In the sector of agroforestry its
   use has seldom been done or documented and one of the reasons for this
   may due to some of its specific challenges. In this study, these
   challenges were addressed when using the Adaptation Pathways for the
   adaptation planning of three case studies in the semi-arid Alentejo
   region, a Mediterranean dryland of southern Portugal. This tool was
   integrated in a participatory approach combined with the Scenario
   Workshop method, to plan the adaptation of the agriculture and forestry
   sector of one municipality (Me?rtola) and two agroforestry farms (221 ha
   and 1000 ha). The methodology included, for each case study, 20
   interviews, two workshops, literature review, expert analysis and the
   use of indicators of efficacy of adaptation measures, to define tipping
   points. The adaptation process and the resulting adaptation plans were
   evaluated by questionnaire and expert review. This combination of
   methods has supported the choice of effective adaptation measures for
   the case studies and when combined with several adaptation pathways and
   a landscape approach it supported the creation of integrated climate
   change adaptation plans that are now in implementation. We discuss how
   this combination of methods deals with limitation to Adaptation Pathways
   identified in the literature, conclude that the method was able to
   create adaptation plans that are now under implementation and present
   avenues for future research.},

Title = {Recent trends in the agrometeorological climate variables over
   Scandinavia},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {316},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The impacts of global climate change in response to increasing
   greenhouse gasses are spatio-temporally heterogeneous and are observed
   in a number of essential climate variables (ECVs). Among the ECVs that
   are highly relevant for the agriculture and forestry applications are
   clouds, precipitation and the incoming surface solar radiation (SIS).
   The past trends in these three agrometeorological ECVs and, more
   importantly, the co-variability among them can impact future agriculture
   and forestry policies and practices, their resilience and conservation.
   Therefore, using 37-year long climate data records spanning from 1982 to
   2018 from the satellite-and surface based observing systems, we
   investigate the co-variability of trends in cloudiness, precipitation
   and SIS over Scandinavia during the summer months (April through
   September).The results reveal a complex nature of such co-variability
   among the trends in these three climate variables over Scandinavia. We
   report that the total cloudiness has decreased over much of Scandinavia.
   The decrease is most pronounced and statistically significant over
   southern Scandinavia in April, over the western coast in July and over
   much of northern Scandinavia in August. These decreasing trends are
   mainly due to reductions in the low and middle level clouds. The trends
   in all-sky incoming surface radiation are opposite in nature and broadly
   follow the spatio-temporal patterns of the trends in total cloudiness.
   The precipitation trends are heterogeneous, both spatially and
   temporally. The analysis of co-variability of trends reveals three
   distinct area-regimes that are relevant for assessing the changes in the
   land use and land cover.},

Title = {Climate change and their impacts in the Balearic Islands: a guide for
   policy design in Mediterranean regions},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding the local effects of global warming-derived impacts is
   important to island systems due to their fragile environmental
   conditions. This is especially true when it comes to Mediterranean
   insular regions as they are climate change (CC) hotspots where
   adaptation and mitigation policy design is an urgent matter. Looking at
   2030 as a time horizon for climate action and focusing on the Balearic
   Islands, this paper reviews the physical changes projected for the
   coming decades as a result of CC and analyses their impacts on regional
   environmental, economic and social variables. Mitigation and adaptation
   measures are also proposed based on the identified priority impacts. The
   fact the Balearics are a top world holiday destination allows the
   analysis to serve as a guide to other Mediterranean islands with
   tourism-based economies facing similar CC scenarios. Results show the
   projected rise of temperature and sea level; the reduction of the
   average precipitation and increase in evapotranspiration, the droughts
   and the increase in ocean acidification and deoxygenation are the main
   threats faced by the Balearics, this putting their economy at risk due
   to the high tourism's vulnerability to CC. Mitigation and adaptation
   action on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, water resources, energy,
   infrastructure and urban planning, human health, economy, law and
   education is recommended. Sustainable mobility and waste managing are
   also viewed as important fields for mitigation action. Conclusions show
   that diversifying the current socioeconomic model is needed to increase
   the community and territory resilience.},

Title = {Changing of the Guard: Adaptation Options That Maintain Ecologically
   Resilient Sandy Beach Ecosystems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Sandy beach ecosystems adapt to sea-level rise by retreating landward.
   Retreat enables a sandy beach ecosystem to adapt while maintaining
   structure and function over various spatial and temporal scales.
   However, adaptation options, such as engineered barriers to shoreline
   retreat, reduce adaptive capacity and, therefore, ecological resilience
   to sea-level rise. Species richness and diversity becomes threatened
   when sandy beaches are squeezed between ``fortifications{''} and
   increasing sea levels. Unidimensional management gives precedence to the
   protection of coastal investments at the expense of ecological
   resilience. This article provides a critical assessment of adaptation
   options to identify those capable of maintaining the ecological
   resilience of sandy beach ecosystems to sea-level rise. Hard- and
   soft-engineered options impede sand transport and storage systems and
   prevent retreat from advancing seas. In contrast, ecosystem conservation
   and setbacks enable coastal processes to continue and thereby maintain
   ecological resilience to sea-level rise. Managing sandy beach ecosystems
   from multidimensional perspectives allows coastal managers to better
   understand the consequences of implementing adaptation options. However,
   political, economic, and social necessity often dictates coastal
   managers employ unidimensional adaptation options to achieve quick
   results. This article proposes a four-dimensional lens through which
   sandy beach ecosystems can be viewed and managed. Longitudinal,
   transverse, vertical, and temporal dimensions characterise the function
   and structure of sandy beach ecosystems. A staged approach to adaptive
   management that takes a long-term view and considers a range of
   adaptation options tailored to achieve ecologically resilient sandy
   beach ecosystems is discussed.},

Title = {Strategic adaptation pathway planning to manage sea-level rise and
   changing coastal flood risk},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {92-101},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Communities around the world are already committed to future sea-level
   rise. Long-term adaptation planning to manage associated coastal flood
   impacts is, however, challenged by uncertainty and contested stakeholder
   priorities. This study provides a proof of concept for a combined robust
   decision making (RDM) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP)
   approach in coastal flood risk management. The concept uses model-based
   support and largely open source tools to help local government plan
   coastal adaptation pathways. Key steps in the method are illustrated
   using a hypothetical case study in Australia. The study shows how
   scenario discovery can provide multi-dimensional descriptions of
   adaptation tipping points which may inform the development of technical
   signpost indicators. Transient scenarios uncovered limitations in
   seemingly robust adaptation policies, where historical path dependencies
   may constrain the rate of adaptation and the extent to which future
   coastal flood impacts can be successfully managed. Lived values have the
   potential to offer insights about non-material social trade-offs that
   residents may need to accept for the benefit of reduced flood risk, and
   could form a basis for defining socially-oriented signpost indicators.
   However, the nuances and subjectivity of lived values means that ongoing
   engagement with residents is essential as part of a combined RDM and
   DAPP approach to preserve the communities' way of life. The learnings
   from this hypothetical case study suggest that testing in a real world
   participatory setting could be valuable in further developing a combined
   RDM and DAPP approach to plan adaptation pathways and manage future
   coastal flood risk.},

Abstract = {Rural households in South Asia's coastal deltas face numerous livelihood
   challenges, including risks posed by climatic variability and extreme
   weather events. This study examines major climate risks, farmers'
   adaptation strategies, and the factors affecting the choice of those
   strategies using data collected from 630 households in southwestern
   coastal Bangladesh. Farmers identified cyclones, excessive rain and
   flooding, and salinity as direct climate risks. Increased crop
   diseases/pests and livestock diseases were perceived as indirect risks
   resulting from climatic variability. Farmers used multiple adaptation
   strategies against those risks such as modifications in farm management,
   use of savings and borrowing funds from family and neighbors, and
   periodically reducing household food consumption. Off-farm employment
   and seeking assistance from governmental as well as non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) were also common adaptation strategies. The results
   show that male-headed households are more likely to change farming
   practices and reduce consumption compared with female-headed households
   that conversely tended to take assistance from NGOs as an adaptation
   strategy. Ownership of land and livestock, as well as farmers' prior
   exposure to climate change and educational training, also had a
   significant effect on the choice of adaptation strategy. Therefore,
   development interventions and policies that aimed at improving resource
   endowment and training to farmers on climatic risks and their adaptation
   strategies can help minimize the impact of climatic risks.},

Title = {The status of climate change adaptation in fisheries management: Policy,

Volume = {22},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Climate change is altering ecosystems and fisheries throughout the
   world's oceans, demanding climate-adaptive governance for conserving and
   managing living marine resources. While in some regions fisheries
   management systems address wider ecosystem dynamics within management
   frameworks and decision-making, which may facilitate resilience to
   climate change, there remains a shortfall in terms of directly
   incorporating climate change adaptation into fisheries management
   legislation and implementation. This review assesses the current state
   of implementation of climate change adaptation into fisheries management
   policies and legislation across 11 national case studies, based on
   government documents and the primary literature. The overarching goal is
   to understand the key elements and gaps in existing fisheries management
   policies and legislation in the context of climate change. Given recent
   reforms of fisheries management policies and/or legislation across the
   nations examined, political recognition of the need to address climate
   change adaptation in fisheries management appears to be increasing;
   albeit formal mandates of climate-adaptation objectives in fisheries
   management are largely missing. Based on our review, recommendations for
   achieving climate-adaptive fisheries management regimes are developed.
   Overall, this study will help to inform and broaden the scope of
   management approaches and tools to accelerate the move towards adaptive
   fisheries management that accounts for climate change impacts on fish
   stocks, fisheries and the societies that depend upon them.},

Abstract = {Water shortages have led to the widespread adoption of adaptive measures
   in south-eastern Spain irrigated agriculture, with an emphasis on
   large-scale supply with desalinated seawater (DSW). This study develops
   an analytical and integrated perspective on the use of desalination as a
   water source for crop irrigation since the mid-2000s in the Segura River
   Basin (SRB), identifying its strengths and current limitations.
   The analysis describes the development of agricultural DSW supply as a
   pivotal means to securing crop production in the SRB, addressing the key
   questions for its sustainable implementation, including: (1) the main
   agronomic concerns, such as low nutrients concentration, crop toxicity
   risk due to high specific ions concentration, or the sodicity risk
   affecting soil physical properties; (2) the energy consumption for DSW
   production and allocation, together with the associated greenhouse gas
   emissions and their effect on the crops' carbon footprint; and (3) the
   production and allocation cost, as the main limiting factor for its
   general adoption since at the moment it jeopardises the profitability of
   the most representative crops. This case study evidences that DSW can be
   a supplementary supply contributing to effectively remove the
   hydrological constraints for crop production in the SRB.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies for port infrastructure and facilities under
   climate change at the Kaohsiung port},
Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {232-244},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The growing impact of climate change on port infrastructure and
   facilities currently may lead to a rising frequency of such serious
   natural disasters or accidents as rising sea level, increasing extreme
   weather, increasing intensity of tropical storms and typhoons, rising
   wave height surmounting breakwater design levels, heavy rain exceeding
   quay well drainage capacity, rising ocean temperatures, and
   deteriorating harbor water quality. The paper aims to apply a risk
   management matrix approach to vulnerability assessment and
   identification of desirable adaptation strategies. The data for this
   investigation is first collected by means of questionnaire survey of
   experts in shipping companies or port management offices at the
   Kaohsiung port. Then, a vulnerability analysis of port infrastructure
   and facilities is carried out under the impact of severe typhoons.
   Subsequently, adaptation strategies are identified for infrastructure
   and facilities at the Kaohsiung port to address the adverse impacts of
   climate change. One intellectual merit of this paper is that ten
   vulnerability assessment criteria are proposed for addressing the
   impacts of climate change on port infrastructure and facilities. Second,
   both ground and access roads in the port area, and drainage facilities
   in flooding-prone areas are shown to be damaged in the moderate risk
   areas potentially impacted by typhoons. The third merit is that a set of
   adaptation strategies has been identified for the moderate risk areas
   impacted by serious typhoons.},

Title = {Fisher's perceptions inform adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability
   to climate change in a Mexican natural protected area},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fishing activities are vulnerable to climate change and natural climatic
   variability. Fishery-dependent coastal communities with low
   diversification of economic activities are especially threatened by
   climate change. We prioritized adaptation measures to climate change,
   through participatory community workshops that captured stakeholders'
   knowledge and perceptions, including fishers, scientists, and managers
   within the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, in Baja California, Mexico.
   During these participatory community workshops, participants addressed
   the potential changes in the spatial distribution of fishery resources,
   the loss of ocean productivity, the increase in sea level, and higher
   storm frequency. The adaptation measures proposed to reduce
   vulnerability to these climate change effects can be grouped in three
   categories: 1) economic diversification, 2) improvement in the
   processing and commercialization of fishery products, and 3) fisheries
   management. Some of the key adaptation measures included diversification
   of fishing activities, processing and marketing, and improving fisheries
   management. In general, Mexico has the comprehensive policy framework
   necessary to implement these measures, but requires financing and a more
   efficient regulatory process that can respond to the rapid effects of
   climate change in marine systems.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the current and potential
   future impacts of climate change on tourism resources and tourism
   activities in Mu Ko Surin National Park. The research method for this
   paper involved the collection of information from interviews with key
   informants, non-participant observation, and secondary data. The results
   found that the park has experienced changes in climate, including
   increasing temperatures, changes in precipitation, rising sea surface
   temperature, and sea-level rise. The impact of increasing temperature
   can lead to mass coral bleaching. The beach was shown to have eroded at
   a rate of about 0.38 m per year. However, water resources are still
   sufficient for tourism activities. The impacts of climate change have
   led to coral reefs and fish being less attractive and reduced in
   quantity, some snorkeling and diving sites being closed. Therefore, for
   sustainable tourism management, adaptation action should take place in
   this area.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal patterns of wildfire burn severity and biomass
   burning-induced emissions in California},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Wildfires are an important disturbance in the Earth system, and their
   emissions have regional and even global impacts on radiation, clouds,
   and climate. The increased frequency and magnitude of California
   wildfires in recent years is altering the terrestrial carbon cycle,
   undermining the state's efforts to reduce the Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) to
   confront climate change. Air quality and public health are also greatly
   affected by air pollution from wildfires. The severity of wildfire burns
   is a critical indicator of both their direct and indirect ecological and
   human impacts. To formulate targeted mitigation strategies, it is
   imperative to understand the evolving scale, location and timing of
   wildfire burn severity and emissions. This study analyzed spatial and
   temporal patterns of burn severity and emissions at 30 m resolution from
   large wildfires (>404 hectares) burning in California during 1984-2020
   from the recently developed Wildfire Burn Severity and Emissions
   Inventory. Results show vegetation and severity play critical roles in
   controlling the spatial and seasonal distribution of emissions.
   California's annual burned area and emissions increased, notably in
   early and late parts of what once was the typical fire season, although
   peak wildfire burned area and emissions continue to occur in mid-Summer.
   Emissions and areas burned in moderate to high severity were
   particularly high and increasing in North Coast and Sierra Nevada
   forests. The 2020 fire year-with the most megafires in California
   history-had 15 times the annual average emissions that occurred during
   1984-2015.},

Title = {Ecological risk assessment of the Marshall Islands longline tuna fishery},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {239-255},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To support implementing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management,
   ecological risk assessment (ERA) methods have recently been developed
   for the continuum of data-deficient to data-rich fisheries. A
   semi-quantitative ERA was conducted for the Marshall Islands longline
   bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) fishery. The study used information from
   analyses of observer data, surveys of captains and crew and inventories
   of gear and equipment. Relative risks were evaluated through a
   consideration of phylogenetic uniqueness, risk of population
   extirpation, risk of species extinction and importance in ecosystem
   regulation. The fishery presents a highest relative risk to leatherback
   (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), green
   (Chelonia mydas) and olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtle
   Regional Management Units that overlap with the fishery, in that order.
   The next highest relative risk is to affected stocks of oceanic whitetip
   (Carcharhinus longimanus), blue (Prionace glauca), and silky
   (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks, in that sequence. Seabird bycatch is
   likely not problematic. There was inadequate information to assess risks
   to cetacean populations. Risks to stocks of market and non-market
   species of marine fishes with r-selected life history characteristics
   were not assessed. This is because estimates of critical threshold
   levels of local and absolute abundance and current biomass are not known
   for many of these stocks. Several best practice gear technology methods
   to mitigate problematic catch of vulnerable species groups are currently
   employed: monofilament leaders, whole fish for bait, singlehooking fish
   bait, no lightsticks, and no fishing at shallow submerged features.
   Setting terminal tackle below 100 m and carrying and using best practice
   handling and release equipment were methods identified to reduce fishing
   mortality and injury of vulnerable species. More information is needed
   to determine if weaker hooks should be prescribed to mitigate cetacean
   bycatch. The large benefit to sea turtles of replacing remaining
   j-shaped hooks with circle hooks `might outweigh a possible small
   increase in elasmobranch catch rates. The consumption of 2024 I of fuel
   per tonne of landed catch, which is within the range of available
   estimated rates from similar fisheries, could be reduced, reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions, through more frequent maintenance and
   upgrading vessel equipment and materials. Observer data quality may be
   adequate to support a quantitative Level 3 ERA to determine the
   significance of the effect of various factors on standardized catch
   rates and to estimate population-level effects from fishing mortality.

Abstract = {Climate change poses serious threats to agriculture. As a primary staple
   crop and major contributor to agriculturally derived greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions, rice systems are of particular significance to building
   climate resilience. We report on a participatory assessment of climate
   resilience in organic and conventional rice systems located in four
   neighboring villages in Negros Occidental, Philippines. The Philippines
   is one of the foremost countries impacted by climate change, with an
   increasing incidence of climate-related disturbances and extensive
   coastlines, high population density and heavy dependence on agriculture.
   Using the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's
   Self-evaluation and Holistic Assessment of climate Resilience of farmers
   and Pastoralists (SHARP) tool, we measured 13 agroecosystem indicators
   of climate resilience, and assessed the degree to which household, farm,
   and community mechanisms and outcomes impact adaptation capacity,
   mitigation potential and vulnerability. We used a participatory approach
   to situate these indicators in their socio-ecological context, and
   identify targeted interventions for enhancing climate resilience based
   on local farmer experiences and socio-ecological conditions. Comparison
   of climate resilience indicators across organic and conventional rice
   systems in this region indicated that organic rice systems are more
   climate resilient than their conventional counterparts. As such,
   increased policy support for the development of organic rice systems are
   critically important as an adaptive mechanism to augment food security,
   mitigate GHG emissions and improve climate resilience in the
   Philippines.},

Title = {Estimating the impact of climate change on the potential distribution of
   Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins with species distribution model},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {As IUCN critically vulnerable species,the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins
   (Sousa chinensis) have attracted great public attention in recent years.
   The threats of human disturbance and environmental pollution to this
   population have been documented extensively. However, research on the
   sensitivity of this species to climate change is lacking. To understand
   the effect of climate change on the potential distribution of Sousa
   chinensis, we developed a weighted ensemble model based on 82 occurrence
   records and six predictor variables (e.g., ocean depth, distance to
   shore, mean temperature, salinity, ice thickness, and current velocity).
   According to the true skill statistic (TSS) and the area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), our ensemble model
   presented higher prediction precision than most of the single-algorithm
   models. It also indicated that ocean depth and distance to shore were
   the most important predictors in shaping the distribution patterns. The
   projections for the 2050s and 2100s from our ensemble model indicated a
   severe adverse impact of climate change on the Sousa chinensis habitat.
   Over 75\% and 80\% of the suitable habitat in the present day will be
   lost in all representative concentration pathway emission scenarios
   (RCPS) in the 2050s and 2100s, respectively. With the increased numbers
   of records of stranding and deaths of Sousa chinensis in recent years,
   strict management regulations and conservation plans are urgent to
   safeguard the current suitable habitats. Due to habitat contraction and
   poleward shift in the future, adaptive management strategies, including
   designing new reserves and adjusting the location and range of reserves
   according to the geographical distribution of Sousa chinensis, should be
   formulated to minimize the impacts of climate change on this species.},

   vulnerabilities, and develop resilience measures to adapt existing
   wastewater facilities to climate change. Coastal and inland facilities
   were assessed including six wastewater treatment plants, 16 pump
   stations, and collection systems. Climate threats considered in the
   assessments included flooding, sea level rise, tsunami, wildfire,
   extreme heat, extreme winds, and drought. The collection of climate
   threats, vulnerabilities, and resilience measures have been summarized
   in climate resilience plans, which provide a systematic approach for
   adapting existing infrastructure to climate change. Comparison of
   resilience plans for coastal versus inland facilities identified
   flooding due to sea level rise as the main climate threat for coastal
   facilities while wildfire, localized flooding, and extreme heat posed
   the greatest threat to inland facilities.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation strategies for Canadian asphalt pavements;
   Part 2: Life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {370},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Presently, there is strong consensus that significant temperature and
   weather changes are fast approaching as a result of climate change.
   Pavements will be significantly affected by increased temperatures,
   precipitation, and flooding, and will require present design methodology
   to be modified accordingly. Several climate change adaptation strategies
   are easily available to agencies including upgraded asphalt binder
   grades, increased Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) thickness, modified mix
   gradations, and stabilized base. The objective of this study is to
   investigate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis
   (LCCA) for climate change adaptation strategies across various locations
   in Canada, from a Global Warming Potential (GWP) perspective. All
   analysis was completed leveraging the Athena Pavement LCA software and
   the LTPP database. The investigated scenarios were (i) a baseline
   asphalt pavement with no climate change, (ii) a baseline asphalt
   pavement with climate change, and (iii) an asphalt pavement adapted to
   withstand climate change, appropriate to the level of changes
   experienced by the specific location. The study revealed that although
   there are initial increases in both cost and emission to administer
   these adaptation strategies, they are offset over the life of the
   pavements. Increasing the HMA thickness and using stabilized bases were
   the most expensive and the highest emitting among the inves-tigated
   strategies, but they are only necessary for extreme coastal climate
   change regions including British Columbia and Newfoundland. British
   Columbia is expected to observe a near 30\% increase in agency costs to
   effectively adapt their pavements to climate change. However, these
   initiatives were found to decrease the overall global warming potential
   by nearly 10\% in comparison to not adapting. The other examined
   locations, although not returning as drastic of changes, followed
   similar trends. The conclusions find that climate change adaptation
   strategies are highly beneficial from the standpoint of both an LCA and
   LCCA for all of the investi-gated locations.},

Title = {Conversion of mangrove forests to shrimp ponds in southeastern China
   destabilizes sediment microbial networks},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {421},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Within the ecosystem, mangroves serve diverse functions by acting as a
   carbon sink, removing nitrogen, providing habitats for marine organisms,
   and regulating climate. Nowadays, many mangrove forests are being
   converted to shrimp ponds across the world, and several studies have
   quantified the effects of this conversion on soil carbon stocks and
   greenhouse gas emissions. However, its effects on the soil microbial
   community structure and assembly processes remain unclear. In the
   present study, high-throughput sequencing and multivariate statistical
   analyses were used to quantify the characteristics of soil microbial
   communities in common mangrove types in southeastern China and the
   adjacent converted shrimp ponds. The relative abundance of
   Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes was significantly
   increased in the shrimp pond sediment compared with that in the mangrove
   sediment, whereas the archaea, represented by Crenarchaeota and
   Euryarchaeota, exhibited the opposite patterns. Moreover, the sediment
   microbial communities in the shrimp ponds exhibited more obvious
   biogeographical distributions than those in the mangrove habitat. Null
   model analysis revealed that variable selection (via deterministic
   processes) governed the microbial community assembly in the mangrove
   sediments, while dispersal limitation (via stochastic processes) shaped
   the microbial community structure in the shrimp pond sediments. Our
   findings suggest that converting mangrove forest habitats to shrimp
   ponds significantly alters the sediment microbial networks, rendering
   them unstable (by disrupting the network topology parameters such as
   modularity, total cohesion, and negative cohesion). This may in turn
   lead to alterations in various ecosystem functions in response to
   habitat conversion, highlighting the need for better preserving
   mangroves through appropriate climate change mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Long-term geological storage of CO2 may be essential for greenhouse gas
   mitigation, so a number of storage strategies have been developed that
   utilize a variety of physical processes. Recent work shows that
   injection of combustion power plant effluent, a mixture of CO2 and N-2,
   into CH4 hydrate-bearing reservoirs blends CO2 storage with simultaneous
   CH4 production where the CO2 is stored in hydrate, an immobile, solid
   compound. This strategy creates economic value from the CH4 production,
   reduces the preinjection complexity since costly CO2 distillation is
   circumvented, and limits leakage since hydrate is immobile. Here we
   explore the phase behavior of these types of injections and describe the
   individual roles of H2O, CO2, CH4, and N-2 as these components partition
   into aqueous, vapor, hydrate, and liquid CO2 phases. Our results show
   that CO2 storage in subpermafrost or submarine hydrate-forming
   reservoirs requires coinjection of N-2 to maintain two-phase flow and
   limit plugging.},

Volume = {49},

Pages = {215-232},

Abstract = {Results of a vulnerability assessment of the Indian River Lagoon to
   climate change indicate future risks to water quality can be mitigated
   through adaptation actions targeting anticipated increases in pollutant
   loads from wastewater treatment plants, on site treatment and disposal
   systems, and surface water storage and conveyance infrastructure. Nine
   adaptation actions are recommended and if successfully implemented could
   reduce risks caused by climate change by fifty percent. The mitigating
   benefits of these actions are expected to cascade into other elements of
   the Lagoon, like living resources and habitats. The results and
   recommendations of this investigation are novel because they are based
   upon site-specific data and anticipated risks prioritized using a
   repeatable and defensible methodology. Furthermore, the focus and
   deliverables were informed by stakeholder involvement to facilitate
   utility to and implementation by resource practitioners. The next
   challenge is to implement, monitor, and revise each adaptation action as
   warranted. This will require a substantial increase in funding dedicated
   to the Lagoon's restoration and coherently managed for decades.
   Strengthened collaboration between local, state, and federal programs is
   necessary to enhance the probability of successfully reducing future
   climate-related water quality impairments and facilitating the emergence
   of a more resilient, climate-ready estuary.},

Title = {Climate Change Planning: Soil Carbon Regulating Ecosystem Services and

Journal = {LAWS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The state of Rhode Island (RI) has established its greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions reduction goals, which require rapidly acquired and updatable
   science-based data to make these goals enforceable and effective. The
   combination of remote sensing and soil information data can estimate the
   past and model future GHG emissions because of conversion of ``low
   disturbance{''} land covers (e.g., evergreen forest, hay/pasture) to
   ``high disturbance{''} land covers (e.g., low-, medium-, and
   high-intensity developed land). These modeled future emissions can be
   used as a predevelopment potential GHG emissions information disclosure.
   This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating
   ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic
   carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept
   of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for RI by
   soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the
   State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database
   (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were
   downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium
   (MRLC) website. Obtained results provide accurate and quantitative
   spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions and show their
   patterns which are often associated with existing urban developments.
   These remote sensing tools could be used by the state of RI to both
   understand the nature of land cover change and likely GHG emissions from
   soil and to institute mandatory or voluntary predevelopment assessments
   and potential GHG emissions disclosures as a part of a climate
   mitigation policy.},

Abstract = {The paper focuses on relocation, retreat, zoning, insurance, and subsidy
   as major dimensions of coastal hazard mitigation measures that have
   resurfaced as potent forces for combating coastal inundation and climate
   change. It reviews the issues surrounding the practice of these measures
   and discusses compatibilities of policies, engineering measures, and
   natural defense. Property rights, development interest, and distorted
   financial incentives pose as main barriers to coastal relocation and
   retreat policies in hazard-prone areas. To understand and propose
   coastal adaptation solutions, the paper recommends place-based studies
   of local coastal adaptation strategies. Place-based studies offer an
   in-depth knowledge of local conditions specifically regarding the level
   of implementation of hazard mitigation policies, and shed light on
   important trade-offs and synergies of various hazard policies. In
   addition, coupling existing hazard mitigation policies with coastal
   management and community management can better inform long-term and
   comprehensive planning of coastal adaptation.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Public fear over environmental and health impacts of CO2 storage, or
   over potential leakage of CO2 from geological reservoirs, is among the
   reasons why over the past decade CCS has not yet been deployed on a
   scale large enough so as to meaningfully contribute to mitigate climate
   change. Storage of CO2 under the seabed moves this climate mitigation
   option away from inhabited areas and could thereby take away some of the
   opposition towards this technology. Given that in the event of CO2
   leakage through the overburden in the case of sub-seabed CCS, the ocean
   could function as buffer for receiving this greenhouse gas, instead of
   it directly being emitted into the atmosphere, offshore CCS could also
   address concerns over the climatic impacts of CO2 seepage. We point out
   that recent geological studies provide evidence that to date CO2 has
   been safely stored under the seabed. Leakage for individual offshore CCS
   operations could thus be unlikely from a technical point of view, if
   storage sites are well chosen, well managed and well monitored. But we
   argue that on a global longterm scale, for an ensemble of thousands or
   millions of storage sites, leakage of CO2 could take place in certain
   cases and/or countries for e.g. economic, institutional, legal or
   safety-cultural reasons. In this paper we investigate what the impact
   could be in terms of temperature increase and ocean acidification if
   leakage occurs at a global level, and address the question what the
   relative roles could be of on- and offshore CCS if mankind desires to
   divert the damages resulting from climate change. For this purpose, we
   constructed a top-down energy-environment-economy model, with which we
   performed a probabilistic Monte-Carlo cost-benefit analysis of climate
   change mitigation with on- and offshore CCS as specific CO2 abatement
   options. One of our main conclusions is that, even under conditions with
   non-zero (permille/year) leakage for CCS activity globally, both onshore
   and offshore CCS should probably - on economic grounds at least - still
   account for anywhere between 20 \% and 80 \% of all future CO2 abatement
   efforts under a broad range of CCS cost assumptions.},

Abstract = {Long-term flood risk adaptation and decision making are complex because
   the future is full of deep uncertainties. Flexibility and robustness can
   be used to deal with future uncertainty. This study developed an
   integrated modeling framework that extends previous studies to the
   spatial domain to assess the future flood risks and the cost and benefit
   of three adaptation measures for four types of buildings in Shanghai.
   Real options analysis (ROA) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP)
   were integrated to develop a dynamic adaptation pathway and identify
   robust adaptation options. The results show that: (1) Sea level rise and
   land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in
   Shanghai; (2) Among the three flood control measures, wet-floodproofing
   has the best economic performance in terms of both the net present value
   and the benefit/cost ratio, followed by dry-floodproofing, and
   elevation; (3) Dry-floodproofing can be used at the beginning of the
   future period (2030-2100), and it can be replaced by wet-floodproofing
   in 2035-2042; the elevation measure also shows good performance at the
   beginning of implementation, but its performance will decline after
   2041-2045; (4) The combined strategy of dry- and wet-floodproofing in
   2044-2046 and a hybrid strategy combining the three measures should be
   the optimal solution for reducing the flood risks in 2047-2051. The
   methodology developed in this study can provide insights for coastal
   cities to formulate cost-effective and feasible adaptation strategies in
   a deeply uncertain future.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on water resources in southern Africa: A
   review},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {67-69},
Pages = {47-54},
Abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that there is
   consensus that the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases will result
   in climate change which will cause the sea level to rise, increased
   frequency of extreme climatic events including intense storms, heavy
   rainfall events and droughts. This will increase the frequency of
   climate-related hazards, causing loss of life, social disruption and
   economic hardships. There is less consensus on the magnitude of change
   of climatic variables, but several studies have shown that climate
   change will impact on the availability and demand for water resources.
   In southern Africa, climate change is likely to affect nearly every
   aspect of human well-being, from agricultural productivity and energy
   use to flood control, municipal and industrial water supply to wildlife
   management, since the region is characterised by highly spatial and
   temporally variable rainfall and, in some cases, scarce water resources.
   Vulnerability is exacerbated by the region's low adaptive capacity,
   widespread poverty and low technology uptake. This paper reviews the
   potential impacts of climate change on water resources in southern
   Africa. The outcomes of this review include highlighting studies on
   detected climate changes particularly focusing on temperature and
   rainfall. Additionally, the impacts of climate change are highlighted,
   and respective studies on hydrological responses to climate change are
   examined. The review also discusses the challenges in climate change
   impact analysis, which inevitably represents existing research and
   knowledge gaps. Finally the paper concludes by outlining possible
   research areas in the realm of climate change impacts on water
   resources, particularly knowledge gaps in uncertainty analysis for both
   climate change and hydrological modelling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Developing adaptation strategies for deltaic and coastal regions is a
   major challenge, due to future uncertainties of climate change and
   complexity of the social-ecological systems to be managed. This paper
   investigates how desirable futures or normative scenarios approaches, in
   particular backcasting, can be used to develop more robust climate
   strategies in coastal regions. The paper develops a methodology in which
   participatory backcasting and adaptive management are combined, and its
   applicability is demonstrated for the Breede-Overberg coastal region in
   South Africa where a catchment management strategy has been developed.
   It is concluded that the methodology offers an adequate framework for
   developing and implementing long-term climate adaptation strategies and
   policies, including a transition management scheme for intermediate
   assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Projecting global urban land expansion and heat island intensification
   through 2050},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urban populations are expected to increase by 2?3 billion by 2050, but
   we have limited understanding of how future global urban expansion will
   affect urban heat island (UHI) and hence change the geographic
   distributions of extreme heat risks. Here we develop spatially explicit
   probabilistic global projections of UHI intensification due to urban
   land expansion through 2050. Our projections show that urban land areas
   are expected to expand by 0.6?1.3 million km(2) between 2015 and 2050,
   an increase of 78\%?171\% over the urban footprint in 2015. This urban
   land expansion will result in average summer daytime and nighttime
   warming in air temperature of 0.5 ;C?0.7 ;C, up to ?3 ;C in some
   locations. This warming is on average about half, and sometimes up to
   two times, as strong as that caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   (multi-model ensemble average projections in Representative
   Concentration Pathway 4.5). This extra urban expansion-induced warming,
   presented here, will increase extreme heat risks for about half of the
   future urban population, primarily in the tropical Global South, where
   existing forecasts already indicate stronger GHG emissions-warming and
   lack of adaptive capacity. In these vulnerable urban areas, policy
   interventions to restrict or redistribute urban expansion and planning
   strategies to mitigate UHIs are needed to reduce the wide ranges of
   impacts on human health, energy system, urban ecosystem, and
   infrastructures.},

Title = {Provincial emission accounting for CO2 mitigation in China: Insights
   from production, consumption and income perspectives},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {255},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Emission accounting can help to identify main CO2 emitters and inform
   emission mitigation policymaking. Previous studies have proved that the
   application of different accounting principles results in different
   emission levels, thus bring different policy implications, while the
   emissions enabled by primary inputs (or income-based emission) have been
   overlooked in studies for carbon mitigation in China. Understanding the
   role of primary inputs in CO2 emissions is a prerequisite to create
   efficient supply-side mitigation policies. Here, we conduct a
   quantitative study of China's provincial production-, consumption-, and
   income-based CO2 emissions in a unified multi-regional input-output
   analysis framework. The results are compared from the three perspectives
   for 30 provinces in China to help the government identify the main
   policy targets from production, demand, and supply sides. We found that
   64\% and 35\% of China's emissions are transferred among provinces
   driven by final demands and primary inputs, respectively. Mitigation
   policies in heavily industrialized provinces, such as Hebei, Liaoning,
   and Henan, where the production-based emissions are higher than the
   consumption- and income-based emissions, should be focused on production
   side. Similarly, policies in eastern coastal developed provinces and
   resource-abundant provinces should be focused on demand- and
   supply-side, respectively. Moreover, we found that tertiary industries,
   which previous studies generally regard as low-carbon industries, are
   the major contributors to China's income-based CO2 emissions with a
   total of 2026 Mt or 31\% of China's total income-based CO2 emissions.
   Thus, expanding tertiary industries without reducing their industrial
   linkages to carbon-intensive industries is not conducive to China's
   emission reduction.},

Pages = {764-768},
Abstract = {This paper addresses a cost analysis and evaluation of the benefits
   associated with different climate change adaptation strategies in
   coastal areas, considering high risk scenarios. For that, a cost
   analysis of adaptation strategies was carried out over a period of 50
   years for Furadouro Beach, Ovar Portugal, a low-lying coastal area with
   high coastal erosion and frequent overtopping. The results show that
   cumulative costs of adaptation measures in the combination of defense
   and accommodation strategies are (sic) 276M, (sic) 164M in
   accommodation, (sic) 112M in defense and (sic) 75M in retreat. These
   results are an example of the importance of evaluating adaptation
   strategies in high-risk areas and show the usefulness of the approach
   taken as a support to decision making for processes that involve urban
   management and territorial planning of coastal zones vulnerable to the
   coastal erosion, wave overtopping and coastal flooding.},

Abstract = {This research examines the economic impact of climate change adaptation
   measures on the housing markets of two representative coastal cities in
   the United States located along the Atlantic Ocean. The results shed
   light on how adaptation measures and investments influence housing
   values and local real estate markets with respect to their place-based
   and local forms of implementation. Numerous quantitative approaches,
   with the use of geospatial data, panel-data hedonic regressions, and
   difference-in-differences analyses, are used to examine changes in
   property values associated with climate adaptation measures and the
   dynamics of risk perception. The results also signal how risk perception
   and hurricane characteristics are reflected in housing markets, thereby
   shedding light on the effects of anticipatory and reactive adaptation
   strategies on property values in these coastal communities.
   Collectively, the study suggests which adaptation strategies and
   characteristics can contribute to maximizing both community resilience
   and economic benefits against the weather extremes caused by climate
   change.},

Title = {Potential for negative emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O)
   through coastal peatland re-establishment: Novel insights from high
   frequency flux data at meter and kilometer scales},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {High productivity temperate wetlands that accrete peat via belowground
   biomass (peatlands) may be managed for climate mitigation benefits due
   to their global distribution and notably negative emissions of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through rapid storage of carbon (C) in
   anoxic soils. Net emissions of additional greenhouse gases (GHG)-methane
   (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)-are more difficult to predict and monitor
   due to fine-scale temporal and spatial variability, but can potentially
   reverse the climate mitigation benefits resulting from CO2 uptake. To
   support management decisions and modeling, we collected continuous 96
   hour high frequency GHG flux data for CO2, CH4 and N2O at multiple
   scales-static chambers (1 Hz) and eddy covariance (10 Hz)-during peak
   productivity in a well-studied, impounded coastal peatland in
   California's Sacramento Delta with high annual rates of C fluxes,
   sequestering 2065 +/- 150 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) and emitting 64.5 +/- 2.4 g
   CH4 m(-2) y(-1). Chambers (n = 6) showed strong spatial variability
   along a hydrologic gradient from inlet to interior plots. Daily (24
   hour) net CO2 uptake (NEE) was highest near inlet locations and fell
   dramatically along the flowpath (-25 to -3.8 to + 2.64 g CO2 m(-2)
   d(-1)). In contrast, daily net CH4 flux increased along the flowpath
   (0.39 to 0.62 to 0.88 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), such that sites of high daily
   CO2 uptake were sites of low CH4 emission. Distributed, continuous
   chamber data exposed five novel insights, and at least two important
   datagaps for wetland GHG management, including: (1) increasing dominance
   of CH4 ebullition fluxes (15\%-32\% of total) along the flowpath and (2)
   net negative N2O flux across all sites as measured during a 4 day period
   of peak biomass (-1.7 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1); 0.51 g CO2 eq m(-2) d(-1)).
   The net negative emissions of re-established peat-accreting wetlands are
   notably high, but may be poorly estimated by models that do not consider
   within-wetland spatial variability due to water flowpaths.},

Abstract = {Adaptation is a key tool to reduce the climate change vulnerability of
   rural people whose livelihood is dependent on agriculture. An
   appropriate policy and strategy cannot be effective without a proper
   understanding of peoples' climate change perception. This study intends
   to explore the local adaptation strategies of the riverine island (char)
   dwellers in the face of climate change hazards through a survey of 374
   char dwellers living in the flood and riverbank erosion prone
   geographically isolated areas in Bangladesh. The study reveals almost no
   difference between the perception of char dwellers and the observed data
   on climate change. It further reports that the climate impacts make the
   char households a vulnerable community and minimize their livelihood
   resilience. A number of local adaptation strategies are adapted by char
   dwellers in the face of climate change effects which enhance their
   livelihood resilience. The study further reveals that homestead
   gardening, changing cropping pattern, tree plantation and migration are
   the most common strategies adapted by char dwellers. The study suggests
   that continuous development program and riverine island-based disaster
   management projects should be executed through an effective monitoring
   for enhancing char dweller's livelihood resilience.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of thermal adaptive strategies in outdoor spaces},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {647-665},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urbanisation has replaced vegetation and natural spaces with hard and
   impervious surfaces and this transition in cities has led to a sequence
   of adverse events in urban ecosystems across the world. The use of
   outdoor spaces is highly dependent on climatic conditions. Thermally
   uncomfortable outdoor spaces may discourage participation in outdoor
   activities and increase indoor energy consumption. Therefore, it is
   necessary to understand and adopt thermal adaptive strategies to provide
   appropriate thermal conditions for urban residents. A number of studies
   that review the literature on different thermal adaptive strategies
   exist. However, the existing reviews lack comprehensiveness, often
   present results which are mixed with simulation and field studies,
   recommended strategies suitable for certain climate conditions or are
   not properly structured. Therefore, this study intends to present a
   critical analysis on the thermal adaptive strategies that are advisable
   for outdoor spaces. This review is structured around the Adaptation to
   Outdoor Climate (AOC) model containing three clusters of adaptive
   strategies: (a) ``environmental and technological modifications{''}, (b)
   ``behavioural adjustments{''} and (c) ``psychological adaptation{''}.
   Reviewing mostly recent studies, this paper aims to shed light on the
   cutting-edge knowledge on improving outdoor thermal comfort conditions.},

Abstract = {According to the general circulation models (CGMs) for future climate
   projections, a temperature increase, precipitation decrease, and an
   increase in the variability of extreme events may be expected in the
   future, likely reducing available water resources. For the western
   Mediterranean, future climate change projections indicate that
   temperature increase may range from 1.5 degrees C to 3.6 degrees C, and
   the precipitation decline will reach between 10\% and 20\%, which may
   result in a significant reduction of natural groundwater recharge. With
   the use of modelling tools, the amount of groundwater recharge under
   different climate change scenarios and varying agricultural management
   practices can be predicted, and water budget attributes can be
   estimated, which may allow for quantifying impacts, and assist in
   defining adaptation strategies. For the Inca-Sa Pobla basin (Balearic
   Islands, Spain), under future climate change projections, agricultural
   management alternatives of crop type distribution and irrigation demands
   are required for planned adaptation strategies. In the area, where
   irrigation water for agricultural practices originates from groundwater
   resources, adaptation measures based on a change from mixed crops to
   potatoes and a 20\% decrease of agricultural land cultivation have
   proven to be efficient for the hydrologic system and associated wetland
   sustainability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Based on United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), building sector
   accounts for 40\% of total energy consumption. In European countries,
   36\% of total greenhouse gas emissions is attributed to buildings. In
   this respect, green roofs are considered to be one of the most
   appropriate sustainable solutions to resolve the urban heat
   island-related issues. Roofs account for nearly 20-25\% of overall urban
   surface areas. Energy saving, thermal insulation, shading and
   evapotranspiration features highlight the key role of green roofs in
   overall thermal performance of buildings and microclimatic conditions of
   indoor environments. Within the scope of this research, the concept of
   green roofs and facades is comprehensively analysed in a holistic and
   thematic way. Following a historical overview of the technology, the
   research is split into various subfields such as energy saving in
   buildings through greenery systems, multifunctional thermal benefits
   including evapotranspiration, thermal insulation, shading and thermal
   comfort features, evaporative cooling for reducing cooling demand and
   minimising wind driven convection losses. The results achieved from the
   literature survey clearly indicate that green roofs and facades are key
   solutions to mitigate building-related energy consumptions and
   greenhouse gas emissions. According to the previous works, heat flow
   through the building roofs in summer can be reduced by approximately
   80\% via green roofs. The green roofs are reported to consume less
   energy in the range of 2.2-16.7\% than traditional roofs during summer
   time. A similar tendency is observed for the winter season depending on
   regional and climatic conditions. The temperature difference between
   conventional and greens roofs in winter is found to be about 4 degrees
   C, which is remarkable. Energy demand of buildings in summer is highly
   dependent on the plant intensity as it is reported to be 23.6, 12.3 and
   8.2 kWh/m(2)/year for extensive, semi-intensive and intensive greenery
   surface, respectively. Greenery systems are also capable of providing
   thermally comfortable indoor and outdoor conditions. It is underlined
   that the annual average accumulation of CO2 reaches the level of
   13.41-97.03 kg carbon/m(2) for 98 m(2) of vertical greenery system. The
   results of this research can be useful for dwellers, builders,
   architects, engineers and policy makers to have a good understanding
   about the potential of green roofs and facades to mitigate
   building-related energy consumptions and carbon emissions in a
   renewable, sustainable, energy-efficient and cost effective way.},

Title = {Legal barriers to adaptive coastal management at a coastal erosion
   hotspot in Florian ` opolis, Brazil},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Adaptive management has long been promulgated as an appropriate approach
   to address the complexity and dynamics of coastal social-ecological
   systems. However, examples of successful implementation of this approach
   are still scarce. Law may be a factor hindering adaptive management,
   particularly when legal provisions are too rigid to enable change.
   Drawing on the management experience of Armaca similar to o Beach (a
   coastal erosion hotspot in the Municipality of Florian ` opolis, State
   of Santa Catarina, Brazil), this paper: (a) analyses how adaptive
   management has been used for coastal management in the selected study
   area and its applicable legal framework; and (b) identifies legal
   barriers to adaptive coastal management. Document analysis and
   semi-structured interviews with 27 participants were undertaken. An
   inductive thematic coding strategy was adopted to analyse interview
   data. Interpretation of results shows that coastal management in Florian
   ` opolis is yet to follow the structured and iterative learning process
   of adaptive management. Vague, imprecise, and generic legal provisions
   have contributed to reactive coastal management. In the context of
   open-ended legislation, government entities have used their legal
   discretion to avoid making coastal management plans, and short-term
   defence strategies to manage coastal erosion have proliferated in
   response to crisis situations. The paper highlights the importance of
   seeking the right balance between legal certainty and legal flexibility,
   providing an entry point to further research and legal reform
   discussions in the field of adaptive coastal management.},

Abstract = {According to recent reports, the number of natural disasters worldwide
   has steadily increased since 1970s {[}1]. When a disaster strikes, the
   whole infrastructure including electricity shuts down for days or years
   depending on the nature of the disaster. In the absence of electricity,
   all human activities and businesses are either damaged or ruined.
   Hurricane Sandy left 8.5 million people across the East Coast without
   power {[}2]. One way of overcoming this problem is to use solar energy
   which is well know example of green technology. Generating electricity
   from solar energy through the process of photovoltaic can be used to
   power, heat, cool, and light our homes and businesses. Photovoltaic (PV)
   power systems provide emission free electricity fueled by the sun which
   is reliable, secure, noise free and does not need refueling. It also
   helps to reduce consumption of fossil fuels in power plants, pollution
   and greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.
   When businesses fail to survive after a disaster, the overall economic
   health and social viability of a community is threatened requiring
   measures taken to return the community to normal after providing relief
   in the early stages of disaster {[}3]. Solar energy has the ability to
   enhance resilience in the communities by providing backup power even if
   the grid is not restored. This can be achieved by making use of solar
   microgrids and developing community solar which is a partnership between
   citizens, government and businesses. The ``Resilient Community{''}
   partnership is a cooperative framework that is essential to fostering
   community disaster resilience {[}4]. The goal of this partnership is to
   maintain the economic and social viability of the community following a
   disaster. After the immediate disaster relief, it is important to
   provide continuous power to the community in case grid system takes
   longer to resume or is located at remote areas.},

Volume = {84},

Abstract = {Blue carbon has gained recognition as a strategy to mitigate climate
   change. Mangroves allow significant amounts of carbon to be sequestered
   and stored and are considered an important component in the offset of
   greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, little is known about the
   ecosystem-level carbon storage of the mangrove stands of Mauritius,
   western Indian Ocean. We conducted an inventory of mangrove stands to
   characterise forest stand structure and estimate carbon stocks in terms
   of aboveground biomass and soil carbon at two sites, Ferney and Pointe
   d'Esny. Different allometric equations relative to species (for areas
   dominated by Rhizophora mucronata or Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) were used
   for aboveground biomass, and the loss-on-ignition method was used for
   estimating soil carbon. The results showed that aboveground biomass
   ranged from 54.57 Mg ha(-1) to 328.71 Mg ha(-1), and soil carbon from
   99.11 +/- 18.35 Mg ha(-1) to 133.45 +/- 30.35 Mg ha(-1). The total
   ecosystem carbon stock ranged from 402.35 +/- 19.29 Mg ha(-1) to 427.81
   +/- 18.35 Mg ha(-1) at Ferney, and from 188.03 +/- 30.35 Mg ha(-1) to
   189.72 +/- 19.27 Mg ha(-1) at Pointe d'Esny. Our results underscore the
   importance of mangrove forest stands and highlight the need for in-depth
   and broader spatial-scope research on blue carbon ecosystems in
   Mauritius.},

Abstract = {This study sought to determine the factors influencing rice farmers'
   adaptation to a slow-onset hazard such as saltwater inundation. The
   research is based on a survey conducted through personal interviews
   using Kobotool App consisting of 326 coastal rice farmers in Northern
   Mindanao, the Philippines and 258 rice farmers in two provinces in the
   Mekong Delta in Vietnam. There were four levels of analyses for the
   assessment of the feasibility of the adaptation measures implemented by
   the farmers. First, it classified adaptation measures into specific
   categories: technology based, farm-based crop management,
   ecosystem-based adaptation, off-farm income diversification, and other
   measures. Second, it developed a multi-criteria assessment tool on
   adaptation measures based on stakeholder analysis and expert judgment
   based on four major feasibility criteria. Third, it determined the level
   of adaptation based on the combination of measures and the feasibility
   of the chosen measures by constructing a measure-based adaptation index
   (MAI). Finally, it came up with a model showing the factors influencing
   the MAI of the farmers. The results revealed that adaptation takes place
   at different levels in the two countries based on the diversity of
   measures, the feasibility of the various measures, and the varying
   conditions of saltwater inundation. The empirical evidence provides
   systematic support for the hypothesis that adaptation measures are
   influenced by a confluence of social, institutional, and economic
   factors.},

   vulnerability analysis. To prioritize the specified measures the GIZ
   methodology is used base don milticriteria and cost-benefit analysis.
   The study comprises the following stages, firstly policies and
   instruments suggested by the academic team, were discussed and slightly
   modified at a meeting with the representatives of La Paz Municipality.
   Secondly, a survey was applied to the main directors and employees
   according to the criteria provided by the GIZ methodology. Thirdly, a
   Public Consultation Forum was organized with the main stakeholders of La
   Paz municipality (NGO, Business, professional associations), where the
   adaptation measures were ranked by thematic and multicriteria approach.
   This stage complemented the multicriteria analysis and presented the
   measures that ranked in first places. The last step consisted in the
   cost-benefit analysis that provided a further ranking to the measures
   and specified the short-term adaptation strategy for the city of La Paz.
   The main areas of this strategy are the following: I. Hydric resources;
   II. Coasts and Tourism; III. Fisheries and biodiversity; IV: Urban
   Planning and Infrastructure; V. Environmental education and research.
   Finally, we present the adaptation strategy for La Paz municipality
   based on the prioritized adaptation measures.},

   barriers that hinder the deployment of shore power supply in the
   container terminals of Djibouti. To achieve this aim, this study
   consults professional experts and experienced managers working in the
   maritime industry. The data collection is based on a survey
   questionnaire collected in the form of linguistic preferences to handle
   fuzziness of human perceptions. The collected linguistic preferences are
   later converted into quantitative data and analyzed using fuzzy
   cognitive map approach. The results reveal that power requirement,
   investment cost and electricity cost are the key barriers that currently
   influence the implementation of the shore power technology in Djibouti.
   The findings of the study have great implications and are hoped to
   assist decision makers and port authority in prioritizing the different
   barriers according to their importance, in an effort to accelerate the
   introduction and the development of green port strategies.

Title = {Perceptions of urban heat island mitigation and implementation
   strategies: survey and gap analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Sustainable development of cities and communities under climate change
   calls for effective and pragmatic strategies to mitigate urban heat
   island (UHI) during hot seasons. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of UHI
   mitigation measures can be affected by public perceptions during
   planning and implementation processes. However, the general perceptions
   of UHI mitigation and implementation strategies have not received
   adequate attention in urban climate research. This study leverages the
   results of a carefully designed survey to fill this research gap. The
   perceptions of professional respondents are largely affected by the
   geographic areas they work in and partially affected by how familiar
   respondents are with the UHI-related building codes and regulations. In
   addition, academic literature and government reports are the two major
   sources for most respondents to obtain UHI mitigation information. We
   also identify four knowledge and implementation gaps: the lack of public
   education on UHI mitigation and implementation measures, the lack of
   effective communications between researchers and code writers, the lack
   of implementing UHI mitigation strategies in some countries, and the
   lack of trustworthy information shared on social media. Bridging these
   gaps are of key importance to fostering public engagement and improving
   the effectiveness of UHI mitigation measures.},

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Using observations and reanalysis, we develop a robust statistical
   approach based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to explore the
   leading drivers of decadal and longer-term Mediterranean hydroclimate
   variability during the historical, half-year wet season. Accordingly, a
   series of CCA analyses are conducted with combined, multi-component
   large-scale drivers of Mediterranean precipitation and surface air
   temperatures. The results highlight the decadal-scale North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) as the leading driver of hydroclimate variations
   across the Mediterranean basin. Markedly, the decadal variability of
   Atlantic-Mediterranean sea surface temperatures (SST), whose influence
   on the Mediterranean climate has so far been proposed as limited to the
   summer months, is found to enhance the NAO-induced hydroclimate response
   during the winter half-year season. As for the long-term, century scale
   trends, anthropogenic forcing, expressed in terms of the global SST
   warming (GW) signal, is robustly associated with basin-wide increase in
   surface air temperatures. Our analyses provide more detailed information
   than has heretofore been presented on the sub-seasonal evolution and
   spatial dependence of the large-scale climate variability in the
   Mediterranean region, separating the effects of natural variability and
   anthropogenic forcing, with the latter linked to a long-term drying of
   the region due to GW-induced local poleward shift of the subtropical dry
   zone. The physical understanding of these mechanisms is essential in
   order to improve model simulations and prediction of the decadal and
   longer hydroclimatic evolution in the Mediterranean area, which can help
   in developing adaptation strategies to mitigate the effect of climate
   variability and change on the vulnerable regional population.},

Abstract = {The causes of methane's renewed rise since 2007, accelerated growth from
   2014 and record rise in 2020, concurrent with an isotopic shift to
   values more depleted in C-13, remain poorly understood. This rise is the
   dominant departure from greenhouse gas scenarios that limit global
   heating to less than 2 degrees C. Thus a comprehensive understanding of
   methane sources and sinks, their trends and inter-annual variations are
   becoming more urgent. Efforts to quantify both sources and sinks and
   understand latitudinal and seasonal variations will improve our
   understanding of the methane cycle and its anthropogenic component.
   Nationally declared emissions inventories under the UN Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and promised contributions to
   emissions reductions under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement need to be
   verified independently by top-down observation. Furthermore, indirect
   effects on natural emissions, such as changes in aquatic ecosystems,
   also need to be quantified. Nitrous oxide is even more poorly
   understood. Despite this, options for mitigating methane and nitrous
   oxide emissions are improving rapidly, both in cutting emissions from
   gas, oil and coal extraction and use, and also from agricultural and
   waste sources. Reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emission are
   arguably among the most attractive immediate options for climate
   action.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Rising
   methane: is warming feeding warming? (part 1)'.},

Abstract = {Deltas provide many worthy ecosystem services. Yet, delta basins are
   quite vulnerable, especially in the face of climate change, which can
   affect the outcome of both agriculture and biodiversity. Moreover, rice
   paddy cultivation is well known to contribute with strong emissions of
   greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as methane (CH4). Thus, knowing the
   atmospheric variability of CH4 in relation to the different stages of
   the rice culture cycle could help to improve GHGs' mitigation strategies
   in deltas.
   The Ebro River Delta, in the northwestern Mediterranean basin, forms
   part of the largest Spanish river basin and is mainly covered by rice
   fields. In this study, for the first time, ground level (40 cm a.g.l.)
   atmospheric CH4 concentrations have been monitored in this area, through
   twenty-seven car mobile transects, over the course of one year.
   Seasonal, diurnal and spatial variability of CH4 concentrations were
   studied to identify its relationship with rice cultivation,
   meteorological conditions and land-use distribution.
   With regard to seasonal variability, autumn transects showed the highest
   mean values for atmospheric CH4 (2.466 ppm) when dead rice straw is
   mixed with the sediment, and weed growth is prevented. Spring and summer
   measurements gave the highest mean CH4 values at dawn (1.897-3.544 ppm),
   whereas autumn and winter produced the mean values after sunset
   (2.148-2.930 ppm). Spatial differences were accounted for by proximity
   to urban areas, presence of shallow water storage structures, and
   distance to seawater. (C) 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air

Title = {Whether conversion of mangrove forest to rice cropland is

Abstract = {The diverse habitat of the mangrove ecosystems all over the globe are
   under continuous threat of conversion for immediate and/or short-term
   economic benefits. Nonetheless, the emission of climatically relevant
   greenhouse gases increases with the disturbance of the mangrove sediment
   - this might undermine the credible reservoir of carbon within the
   sediment. This article attempts to estimate the environmental (carbon
   emission) and economic consequences of converting mangrove to cropland
   (especially rice paddy) based on field-scale study at three different
   sites (Khola, Gupti and Damra) within the Bhitarkanika mangrove for two
   consecutive years. The study suggests that the cumulative methane (CH4)
   emission was significantly higher from the rice paddy (211.3 kg ha(-1))
   compared to the mangrove sediment (50.8 kg ha(-1)), while the average
   nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was significantly higher from the later
   (2.1 kg ha(-1)). Multivariate statistical analysis suggests that the
   land use was the prime controlling factor for variation in CH4 and N2O
   emission. Total carbon equivalent emission (CEETOT) from the rice paddy
   was significantly higher than mangrove during the study period. The
   study suggests that the economic value of the mangrove ecosystem was
   several folds higher than that of the rice paddy. The CEETOT of the
   Bhitarkanika mangrove has increased approximately 212 Gg over last few
   decades due to the conversion of the mangrove area to the rice paddy.
   Such studies are imperative in developing effective regional climate
   change adaptation strategies. The study advocates urgent need to educate
   and aware people about the benefits of the mangrove compared to the
   cropland.},

Title = {Impact of passive climate adaptation measures and building orientation
   on the energy demand of a detached lightweight semi-portable building},
Journal = {BUILDING SIMULATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1163-1177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The building energy demand for heating and cooling is changing due to
   climate change. The adoption of climate change adaptation measures at
   the building scale aims at limiting heating and cooling demands. In
   previous studies on adaptation measures little attention has been paid
   to lightweight semi-portable buildings, which are increasingly used to
   temporarily house the growing number of small households (1-2 persons)
   in peripheral and derelict areas. In this paper the impact of passive
   climate adaptation measures and building orientation on heating and
   cooling demands is assessed for a detached, lightweight, semi-portable
   residential building by means of building energy simulations (BES),
   considering two climate scenarios for the Netherlands: current climate
   and a future climate (2050). The results show that the most efficient
   adaptation measure consists in a combination of exterior solar shading
   and an increase of thermal resistance of the building envelope, which
   reduces the annual heating and cooling demand-averaged over eight
   building orientations - by 11\% for the current climate and 15\% for the
   future climate. The impact of building orientation varies according to
   the climate scenario. Compared to the average over the eight
   orientations considered, the annual cooling demand for a single
   orientation varies between about -31\% and +22\% and between about -24\%
   and +18\% for the current and future climate, respectively. For the case
   without adaptation measures, optimizing the building orientation leads
   to annual total energy savings of about 4\% for the current and 3\% for
   the future climate.},

Abstract = {The worst droughts in the central part of the North American Prairie in
   the past several hundred years have been reconstructed from tree-ring
   chronologies, suggesting that some drought years have exceeded the
   severity shown by the gauge record. A general circulation model of the
   Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has simulated climate
   changes for the area during the past 250 years driven by climatic
   forces, providing scenarios of extreme climate that can further diagnose
   the mechanisms. This study refined the drought signals from the tree
   ring data and GFDL modeling at inter-annual and decadal time scales and
   analyzed the potential mechanisms driving the droughts. Results showed
   that drought years with summer precipitation lower than the 10th
   percentiles occurred during 1777-1789, 1847-1861 and 1886-1879 AD in the
   area. Both tree rings and model revealed that the frequency of droughts
   has been relatively consistent in a similar timing and frequency with
   climate change. Monte Carlo analysis have detected that the tree ring
   chronologies have recorded drought years with probabilities of
   9.3\%-12.8\%, and the model has simulated the droughts with
   probabilities 5.7\%-17.8\%. Under CO2 and aerosol forcing, the GFDL
   modeled the drought recurrences of 13 years and 25 years, which are very
   synchronous changes with tree rings and consistent with gauge records.
   The 20-a and 10-a time scale reoccurrences of droughts are very
   consistent with solar radiation cycles, and similar to the length of
   cycles in oceanic records, suggesting that terrestrial precipitation
   modeling is properly driven from sun-land-sea dynamics. Detected
   severity, variability and return periods of droughts from the present
   study make potential improvements in drought predictions and
   constructing scenarios for climate impacts and adaptation strategies.},

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ammonia, methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions were
   measured during a complete production cycle in an enriched cage laying
   hen facility under Oceanic climate conditions. Continuous monitoring of
   gas concentration, ventilation rate and environmental parameters were
   conducted from April 2012 to September 2013. The seasonal and diurnal
   pattern of gas emissions was analysed.
   Seasonality effect was found for NH3 emission, showing an average
   emission of 144.9 mg d(-1) hen(-1) and 90.3 mg d(-1) hen(-1) in summer
   and winter, respectively. On the contrary, diurnal pattern of NH3
   emission did not differ between these seasons. For CO2, mean emission
   values did not show seasonality, although the diurnal pattern differed
   between winter and summer. Results obtained for CH4 and N2O emissions
   did not provide sufficient evidence to determine either seasonality or
   diurnal effect on these gases.
   An NH3 emission factor of 7\% of total N in manure was defined for this
   system. These losses increased at higher ventilation rates and lower
   belt cleaning frequencies. Thus, NH3 mitigation strategies at housing
   level should consider both parameters. Further studies would be
   necessary to determine how these factors regulate NH3 emission at laying
   hen houses. (C) 2016 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report WGIII climate assessment of mitigation
   pathways: from emissions to global temperatures},

Volume = {15},
Number = {24},
Pages = {9075-9109},

Abstract = {While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) physical
   science reports usually assess a handful of future scenarios, the
   Working Group III contribution on climate mitigation to the IPCC's Sixth
   Assessment Report (AR6 WGIII) assesses hundreds to thousands of future
   emissions scenarios. A key task in WGIII is to assess the global mean
   temperature outcomes of these scenarios in a consistent manner, given
   the challenge that the emissions scenarios from different integrated
   assessment models (IAMs) come with different sectoral and gas-to-gas
   coverage and cannot all be assessed consistently by complex Earth system
   models. In this work, we describe the ``climate-assessment{''} workflow
   and its methods, including infilling of missing emissions and emissions
   harmonisation as applied to 1202 mitigation scenarios in AR6 WGIII. We
   evaluate the global mean temperature projections and effective radiative
   forcing (ERF) characteristics of climate emulators FaIRv1.6.2 and
   MAGICCv7.5.3 and use the CICERO simple climate model (CICERO-SCM) for
   sensitivity analysis. We discuss the implied overshoot severity of the
   mitigation pathways using overshoot degree years and look at emissions
   and temperature characteristics of scenarios compatible with one
   possible interpretation of the Paris Agreement. We find that the lowest
   class of emissions scenarios that limit global warming to ``1.5 degrees
   C (with a probability of greater than 50 \%) with no or limited
   overshoot{''} includes 97 scenarios for MAGICCv7.5.3 and 203 for
   FaIRv1.6.2. For the MAGICCv7.5.3 results, ``limited overshoot{''}
   typically implies exceedance of median temperature projections of up to
   about 0.1 degrees C for up to a few decades before returning to below
   1.5 degrees C by or before the year 2100. For more than half of the
   scenarios in this category that comply with three criteria for being
   ``Paris-compatible{''}, including net-zero ornet-negative greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions, median temperatures decline by about 0.3-0.4 degrees C
   after peaking at 1.5-1.6 degrees C in 2035-2055. We compare the methods
   applied in AR6 with the methods used for SR1.5 and discuss their
   implications. This article also introduces a ``climate-assessment{''}
   Python package which allows for fully reproducing the IPCC AR6 WGIII
   temperature assessment. This work provides a community tool for
   assessing the temperature outcomes of emissions pathways and provides a
   basis for further work such as extending the workflow to include
   downscaling of climate characteristics to a regional level and
   calculating impacts.},

Title = {10th anniversary review: a changing climate for coral reefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tropical coral reefs are charismatic ecosystems that house a significant
   proportion of the world's marine biodiversity. Their valuable goods and
   services are fundamental to the livelihood of large coastal populations
   in the tropics. The health of many of the world's coral reefs, and the
   goods and services they provide, have already been severely compromised,
   largely due to over-exploitation by a range of human activities. These
   local-scale impacts, with the appropriate government instruments,
   support and management actions, can potentially be controlled and even
   ameliorated. Unfortunately, other human actions (largely in countries
   outside of the tropics), by changing global climate, have added
   additional global-scale threats to the continued survival of present-day
   coral reefs. Moderate warming of the tropical oceans has already
   resulted in an increase in mass coral bleaching events, affecting nearly
   all of the world's coral reef regions. The frequency of these events
   will only increase as global temperatures continue to rise. Weakening of
   coral reef structures will be a more insidious effect of changing ocean
   chemistry, as the oceans absorb part of the excess atmospheric carbon
   dioxide. More intense tropical cyclones, changed atmospheric and ocean
   circulation patterns will all affect coral reef ecosystems and the many
   associated plants and animals. Coral reefs will not disappear but their
   appearance, structure and community make-up will radically change.
   Drastic greenhouse gas mitigation strategies are necessary to prevent
   the full consequences of human activities causing such alterations to

Title = {Urban resilience to future urban heatwaves under a climate change
   scenario: A case study for Porto urban area (Portugal)},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {This work aimed to assess the effectiveness of several resilience
   strategies to mitigate extreme urban heat episodes in Porto (Portugal).
   Different resilience scenarios were studied with the WRF urban modelling
   system, using as case-study a future heat wave occurring in Porto urban
   area. The resilience factors considered were the increase of urban green
   areas and the application of cool (green and white) roofs. The results
   showed that the most effective resilience strategies to mitigate high
   urban temperatures are the application of cool roofs. These resilience
   strategies produced the strongest reduction in the average and maximum
   surface temperatures over Porto urban area under a future heat wave.
   Considering that white roofs are considerably easier and cheaper to
   apply in urban areas than green roofs, this resilience strategy can be
   seen as the most viable, cost-effective and economically attractive
   approach for mitigating extreme urban temperatures. This study proposed
   several different urban resilience strategies to extreme temperature
   episodes for the first time for Porto urban area, proved their
   effectiveness and compared their ability to reduce urban heat. Such
   findings can be of great importance for Porto urban planning
   stakeholders given the expected increase in the heat waves frequency and
   intensity in future climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Rio (1992) to Glasgow (2021): Three decades of inadequate mitigation of
   climate change and its slow onset effects},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {This study reviews the global increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas
   (GHG) concentrations, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
   nitrous oxide (N2O), alongside the accelerated climatic change and its
   slow onset effects (or events) between 1992 and 2021. The establishment
   of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in
   1992, and the simultaneous UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, generated
   the international efforts to tackle climatic change. Over the years, the
   UNFCCC-Conference of the Parties (COP) has led the efforts in climate
   change mitigation and adaptation, with many sequential meetings across
   the world. Three decades later, at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow in 2021,
   it is evident that climate change impacts have substantially worsened.
   Despite some uncertainties, it seems that over the last three decades,
   the climate change slow onset events, including 1) increasing
   temperatures, 2) glacial retreat, 3) sea level rise, 4) ocean
   acidification, 5) soil salinization, 6) land and forest degradation, 7)
   loss of biodiversity, and 8) desertification, have substantially
   exacerbated. Simultaneously, other (non-GHGs related) anthropogenic
   impacts, including habitat fragmentation, land-use and sea-use change
   and misuse, species overexploitation, environmental pollution,
   infrastructure constructions, and urbanization, have considerably
   increased. With the aim of achieving the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways
   1.9 (SSP1-1.9) or SSP1-2.6 ultimate goals-keeping global warming in
   2,100 below 1.5? or 2.0?, respectively, compared to preindustrial
   levels-it may still be possible to avoid climate change's irreversible
   tipping points. To reach this target, policymaking must become more
   decisive and proactive, with continuous risks assessment, frequent
   monitoring of outcomes and their compatibility to goals, implementing
   practical legislation tools, and assigning specific financial
   instruments, aimed at effectively tackling climate change slow onset
   events and related environmental issues. Substantial efforts should be
   invested in boosting climate change mitigation, while simultaneously
   targeting effective climatic change adaptation measures and promoting
   environmental conservation and restoration. Relying on tools such as the
   UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will sustain provisioning,
   supporting, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services, thus improving
   water(-), food(-), environmental(-), energy(-), economic(-), health(-),
   and governance-security, while lessening the risks of social unrest,
   violent conflicts, mass migration, and other humanitarian catastrophes.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {229-240},

Abstract = {Effective publicly developed adaptation strategies are crucial in
   managing the impacts of Climate Change. Adaptation strategy development
   is particularly complex in estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems
   because of their diverse environmental values, extensive human
   utilisation and the complex socioecological systems they support.
   Although many generic adaptation frameworks are available they cannot
   provide specific guidance for locally relevant strategy development. In
   contrast, situation-specific tools work well for their intended purpose
   but are usually unsuitable for a different situation. The gap between
   generic frameworks and situation-specific tools is addressed in this
   study by developing a set of general principles to provide guidance for
   the efficient and robust development of adaptation strategies. The nine
   principles comprise a conceptualisation of the various factors that are
   likely to have an effect on the success or otherwise of an adaptation
   strategy and they apply in any situation. An example `adaptation
   checklist' that serves as a guide to practitioners in the field, will
   help ensure that all critical components are covered during the
   development of an adaptation strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   building energy consumption},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {255},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {UHI has significant impact on building energy consumption and associated
   greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas globally. However, the nature
   and extent of these effects are governed by the year-round climatic
   conditions at specific locations. In a dualistic relationship, UHI tends
   to increase the annual energy consumption of buildings located in hot
   climates and decrease it in cold climates. In this study, we conducted
   building energy simulations for 43 locations around the United States
   (U.S.) in order to quantify the relationships among the energy impacts
   of UHI and climatic variables. The energy impacts of UHI were found to
   be strongly correlated with several variables including degree days,
   absolute humidity, and solar radiation, while independent of wind speed
   and precipitation. Consecutively, we developed a multiple regression
   model to predict the relative energy impacts of UHI based on climatic
   context and evaluated the effect of UHI intensity on energy impacts
   across all 15 U.S. climate zones. The results of this study
   quantitatively validate the dualistic nature of UHI and present a
   statistical method to estimate the climatic variation in the impacts of
   UHI on building energy consumption. This can have significant
   implications in prioritizing UHI mitigation policies based on location
   and climate. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Farmers' Perspective on Agriculture and Environmental Change in the
   Circumpolar North of Europe and America},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change may increase the importance of agriculture in the global
   Circumpolar North with potentially critical implications for pristine
   northern ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. With this in mind,
   a global online survey was conducted to understand northern agriculture
   and farmers' perspective on environmental change north of 60 degrees N.
   In the obtained dataset with 67 valid answers, Alaska and the Canadian
   territories were dominated by small-scale vegetable, herbs, hay, and
   flower farms; the Atlantic Islands were dominated by sheep farms; and
   Fennoscandia was dominated by cereal farming. In Alaska and Canada,
   farmers had mostly immigrated with hardly any background in farming,
   while farmers in Fennoscandia and on the Atlantic Islands mostly
   continued family traditions. Accordingly, the average time since
   conversion from native land was 28 +/- 28 and 25 +/- 12 years in Alaska
   and Canada, respectively, but 301 +/- 291 and 255 +/- 155 years on the
   Atlantic Islands and in Fennoscandia, respectively, revealing that
   American northern agriculture is expanding. Climate change was observed
   by 84\% of all farmers, of which 67\% have already started adapting
   their farming practices, by introducing new varieties or altering
   timings. Fourteen farmers reported permafrost on their land, with 50\%
   observing more shallow permafrost on uncultivated land than on
   cultivated land. Cultivation might thus accelerate permafrost thawing,
   potentially with associated consequences for biogeochemical cycles and
   greenhouse gas emissions. About 87\% of the surveyed farmers produced
   for the local market, reducing emissions of food transport. The dynamics
   of northern land-use change and agriculture with associated
   environmental changes should be closely monitored. The dataset is
   available for further investigations.},

Title = {Meeting GHG reduction targets requires accounting for all forest sector
   emissions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) must be reduced to avoid an
   unsustainable climate. Because carbon dioxide is removed from the
   atmosphere and sequestered in forests and wood products, mitigation
   strategies to sustain and increase forest carbon sequestration are being
   developed. These strategies require full accounting of forest sector GHG
   budgets. Here, we describe a rigorous approach using over one million
   observations from forest inventory data and a regionally calibrated
   life-cycle assessment for calculating cradle-to-grave forest sector
   emissions and sequestration. We find that Western US forests are net
   sinks because there is a positive net balance of forest carbon uptake
   exceeding losses due to harvesting, wood product use, and combustion by
   wildfire. However, over 100 years of wood product usage is reducing the
   potential annual sink by an average of 21\%, suggesting forest carbon
   storage can become more effective in climate mitigation through
   reduction in harvest, longer rotations, or more efficient wood product
   usage. Of the similar to 10 700 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide
   equivalents removed from west coast forests since 1900, 81\% of it has
   been returned to the atmosphere or deposited in landfills. Moreover,
   state and federal reporting have erroneously excluded some
   product-related emissions, resulting in 25\%-55\% underestimation of
   state total CO2 emissions. For states seeking to reach GHG reduction
   mandates by 2030, it is important that state CO2 budgets are effectively
   determined or claimed reductions will be insufficient to mitigate
   climate change.},

Title = {Exploring Pattern of Green Spaces (GSs) and Their Impact on Climatic
   Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies: Evidence from a Saudi
   Arabian City},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Green spaces (GSs) are significant, nature-based solutions to climate
   change and have immense potential to reduce vulnerability to heat waves
   while enhancing the resilience of urban areas in the light of climate
   change. However, in the Saudi context, the availability of GSs across
   cities and their perceived role in climate change mitigations and
   adaptation strategies remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine the
   per capita availability of GSs in the Jeddah megacity in Saudi Arabia,
   and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
   This study assessed the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah city
   using GIS techniques, and a questionnaire survey (online and an onsite)
   was conducted to assess the GSs users' perception of the role of GSs on
   climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Non-parametric
   tests were also used to find differences in roles based on
   socio-demographic attributes. The findings of the study revealed that:
   (i) the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah is relatively low in
   comparison to international organization recommendations (such as World
   Health Organization and European Union). As per the survey result, it
   was reported that GSs play crucial role for climate change mitigation
   such as temperature regulation, reduction in heat stress, enhancement
   outdoor thermal comfort, and the maintenance of air quality. More than
   85\% of the total respondents agreed with the very high importance of
   GSs for climate change mitigation. More than 80\% of respondents in the
   city highly agreed with climate change adaptation strategies such as the
   enhancement of accessibility to GSs, ecosystem-based protection of GSs,
   and the improvement of per capita availability of GSs. The findings of
   the study will be very helpful to planners and policymakers in
   implementing nature-based solutions to reduce vulnerability to climate
   change in Jeddah city, and particularly other cities in a desert
   environment.},

   Focusing on Emissions from Amine-Based Scrubbing Solvents to Air},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has become a key technology in climate
   change mitigation programs worldwide. CCS is well-studied in terms of
   greenhouse gas emission reduction potential and cost of implementation.
   Impacts on human health and the environment have, however, received
   considerably less attention. In this work, we present a first assessment
   of human health and environmental impacts of a postcombustion CO2
   capture facility, focusing on emissions from amine-based scrubbing
   solvents and their degradation products to air. We develop
   characterization factors for human toxicity for monoethanolamine (MEA)
   as these were not yet available. On the basis of the limited information
   available, our assessment indicates that amine-based scrubbing results
   in a 10-fold increase in toxic impact on freshwater ecosystems and a
   minor increase in toxic impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. These
   increases are attributed to emissions of monoethanolamine. For all other
   impact categories, i.e., human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, particulate
   matter formation, photochemical oxidant formation, and terrestrial
   acidification, the CO2 capture facility performs equally well to a
   conventional NGCC power plant albeit substantial changes in flue gas
   composition. The oxidative degradation products of MEA, i.e.,
   formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and ammonia, do not contribute significantly
   to total environmental impacts.},

Title = {Multi-dimensional coping and adaptation strategies of small-scale
   fishing communities of Bangladesh to climate change induced stressors},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {446-468},
Abstract = {Purpose - Coastal and floodplain areas are on the frontline of climate
   change in Bangladesh. Small-scale coastal and floodplain fishing
   communities of the country face a host of cross-scale stressors
   continually, some induced by climate change, and they have developed
   coping and adaption strategies based on customary social and
   experiential learnings. This paper aims to examine the coping and
   adaptation strategies that small-scale fishing communities undertake in
   the face of stresses including climate change and variability.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research takes a nuanced
   ethnographic-oriented approach based on around two-year-long field study
   in two coastal and floodplain fishing villages, represented by two
   distinct ethnic groups. The study adopts direct observational methods to
   denote the ways small-scale fishing communities address the arrays of
   stressors to construct and reconstruct their survival and livelihood
   needs.
   Findings - It was observed that fishers' coping and adaptation
   strategies comprise a fluid combination of complex overlapping sets of
   actions that the households undertake based on their capitals and
   capabilities, perceptions, socio-cultural embeddedness and experiential
   learnings from earlier adverse situations. Broadly, these are survival,
   economic, physiological, social, institutional and
   religiosity-psychological in nature. Adaptation mechanisms involve some
   implicit principles or self-provisioning actions that households are
   compelled to do or choose under given sets of abnormal stresses to reach
   certain levels of livelihood functions.
   Originality/value - Based on empirical field research, this paper
   recognizes small-scale fishers' capability and adaptability in
   addressing climate change-induced stresses. Policymakers, international
   development planners, climate scientists and social workers can learn
   from these grassroots-level coping and adaptation strategies of fishing
   communities to minimize the adverse effects of climate change and
   variations.},

Title = {Effectiveness of flood damage mitigation measures: Empirical evidence
   from French flood disasters},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {74-84},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent destructive flood events and projected increases in flood risks
   as a result of climate change in many regions around the world
   demonstrate the importance of improving flood risk management.
   Flood-proofing of buildings is often advocated as an effective strategy
   for limiting damage caused by floods. However, few empirical studies
   have estimated the damage that can be avoided by implementing such flood
   damage mitigation measures. This study estimates potential damage
   savings and the cost-effectiveness of specific flood damage mitigation
   measures that were implemented by households during major flood events
   in France. For this purpose, data about flood damage experienced and
   household flood preparedness were collected using a survey of 885 French
   households in three flood-prone regions that face different flood
   hazards. Four main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First,
   using regression analysis results in improved estimates of the
   effectiveness of mitigation measures than methods used by earlier
   studies that compare mean damage suffered between households who have,
   and who have not, taken these measures. Second, this study has provided
   empirical insights showing that some mitigation measures can
   substantially reduce damage during floods. Third, the effectiveness of
   the mitigation measures is very regional dependent, which can be
   explained by the different characteristics of the flood hazard in our
   sample areas that experience either slow onset river flooding or more
   rapid flash and coastal flooding. Fourth, the cost-efficiency of the
   flood damage mitigation measures depends strongly on the flood
   probability faced by households. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Persistent Increases in Nighttime Heat Stress From Urban Expansion
   Despite Heat Island Mitigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Urban areas generally have higher near-surface air temperature and lower
   air humidity than rural areas. Little is known about how heat stress,
   the combined effect of high air temperature and high humidity on human
   physiology, will be affected by future urban land expansion. Here we use
   a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model to examine the effects of
   urban land expansion from 2000 to 2050 on heat stress (measured as
   wet-bulb globe temperature, WBGT) in the urban areas of China, India,
   and Nigeria, which are projected to account for one-third of global
   urban population growth through 2050. Our results show that urban
   expansion slightly reduces heat stress during the day (similar to 0.2
   degrees C) but substantially intensifies it at night, by similar to 1
   degrees C on average and by up to 2-3 degrees C in five mega-urban
   regions (MURs). These effects exist with or without climate change
   induced by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Installing
   cool roofs-an urban heat island mitigation measures-can reduce the
   daytime WBGT by 0.5-1 degrees C, partially offsetting the heat stress
   conditions caused by GHG-induced climate change. However, even with cool
   roofs, the nighttime WBGTs are higher by 0.3-0.9 degrees C over the
   whole countries studied, and by 1-2 degrees C in the MURs under the
   urban expansion scenario, compared to the situation in which urban areas
   remain unchanged. These results show that future urban expansion and
   heat island mitigation can result in potential daytime benefits but also
   persistent nighttime risks.},

Title = {Moving towards sustainable coasts: A critical evaluation of a
   stakeholder engagement group in successfully delivering the mechanism of
   adaptive management},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {184-193},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is widely recognized that there is a need for engagement between
   stakeholders to establish locally accepted strategies for sustainable
   coastal management solutions around the world. Adaptive management
   approaches have emerged as one of the preferred mechanisms in coastal
   zone management. Central to the application of adaptive management is
   the effective engagement of stakeholders to encourage participatory
   decision-making. There are relatively few studies which have analysed
   the effectiveness and dynamics of stakeholder groups to establish
   sustainable adaptive management in practice, and identify what
   opportunities and challenges can arise from such collaborative
   approaches. This research critically evaluates stakeholder engagement in
   the adoption of adaptive management at East Head, England. The study has
   identified significant issues and opportunities that have arisen
   throughout the decision-making process. It has found that a major
   challenge has been to achieve acceptance of the mechanism of adaptive
   management, particularly in relation to aspects of uncertainty. However,
   it is of critical note that the advisory group in question has become a
   valuable vehicle in bringing together key stakeholders throughout all
   stages of the adoption of the adaptive management approach. It is
   suggested that this approach, has gradually reduced conflict through
   building knowledge, gaining trust and ultimately achieving acceptance. A
   widely applicable management model and recommendations for best practice
   are presented as derived from the views of the advisory group itself.
   This model has the potential to develop a more dynamic, holistic and
   sustainable approach to coastal governance both in the UK and at other
   locations further afield.},

Title = {A Resilience Approach Can Improve Anadromous Fish Restoration},
Journal = {FISHERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Most anadromous fish populations remain at low levels or are in decline
   despite substantial investments in restoration. We explore whether a
   resilience perspective (i.e., a different paradigm for understanding
   populations, communities, and ecosystems) is a viable alternative
   framework for anadromous fish restoration. Many life history traits have
   allowed anadromous fish to thrive in unimpacted ecosystems but have
   become contemporary curses as anthropogenic effects increase. This
   contradiction creates a significant conservation challenge but also
   makes these fish excellent candidates for a resilience approach. A
   resilience approach recognizes the need to maintain life history,
   population, and habitat characteristics that increase the ability of a
   population to withstand and recover from multiple disturbances. To
   evaluate whether a resilience approach represents a viable strategy for
   anadromous fish restoration, we review four issues: (1) how resilience
   theory can inform anadromous fish restoration, (2) how a
   resilience-based approach is fundamentally different than extant
   anadromous fish restoration strategies, (3) ecological characteristics
   that historically benefited anadromous fish persistence, and (4)
   examples of how human impacts harm anadromous fish and how a resilience
   approach might produce more successful outcomes. We close by suggesting
   new research and restoration directions for implementation of a
   resilience-based approach.},

Title = {Modelling carbon dioxide storage within Closed structures in the UK
   Bunter Sandstone Formation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {38-50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Bunter Sandstone Formation in the UK Southern North Sea has the
   potential to become an important CO2 storage unit if carbon dioxide
   capture and storage becomes a widely deployed option for the mitigation
   of greenhouse gases. A detailed geological model of a region of the
   Bunter Sandstone consisting of four domed structural closures was
   created using existing seismic, well log and core data. Compositional
   simulation of CO2 injection was performed to estimate the storage
   capacity of domes within the system. The injection was constrained by
   both pressure and CO2 migration criteria, and the storage efficiencies
   of the domes (volume of stored CO2 divided by the pore volume of the
   dome) were calculated when injection ceased. A sensitivity study
   evaluated the effect of varying the total aquifer volume, reservoir
   heterogeneity and injection well location. A wide range of storage
   efficiency values were obtained across the different simulation cases,
   ranging from 4\% (closed dome) to 33\% (homogeneous model).
   Intrareservoir heterogeneity, specifically in the form of continuous low
   permeability layers has an important effect on storage capacity in
   dome-like structures, because it increases the tendency for CO2 to
   migrate laterally from the storage complex via structural spill points.

Abstract = {The long term impact posed by climate change risk remains unclear and is
   subject to diverse interpretations from different maritime stakeholders.
   The inter-dynamics between climate change and ports can also
   significantly diversify in different geographical regions. Consequently,
   risk and cost data used to support climate adaptation is of high
   uncertainty and in many occasions, real data is often unavailable and
   incomplete. This paper presents a risk and cost evaluation methodology
   that can be applied to the analysis of port climate change adaptation
   measures in situations where data uncertainty is high. Risk and cost
   criteria are used in a decision-making model for the selection of
   climate adaptation measures. Information produced using a fuzzy-Bayesian
   risk analysis approach is utilized to evaluate risk reduction outcomes
   from the use of adaptation measures in ports. An evidential reasoning
   approach is then employed to synthesize the risk reduction data as
   inputs to the decision-making model. The results can assist policymakers
   in developing efficient adaptation measures that take into account the
   reduction in the likelihood of risks, their possible consequences, their
   timeframe, and costs incurred.
   A technical study across 14 major container ports in Greater China is
   presented to demonstrate the interaction between cost and risk analysis,
   and to highlight the applicability of the stated methodology in
   practice. The paper offers a useful analytical tool for assessing
   climate change risks to ports and selecting the most cost-effective
   adaptation measures in uncertain conditions. It can also be used to
   compare the practitioners' perceptions of climate risks across different
   geographical regions, and to evaluate improvements after implementation
   of the selected adaptation measures with potential budgetary
   constraints. The methodology, together with the illustrative cases,
   provides important insights on how to develop efficient climate change
   adaptation measures in a supply chain context to improve the
   sustainability of development and enhance adaptation measures for ports,
   port cities, intermodal transport, supply chains, and urban and regional
   planning in general. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of Land Use Types on CH(4)and CO(2)Production Potentials in
   Subtropical Wetland Soils},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Changes in land use types can alter the soil and environmental
   characteristics of wetlands, which in turn influence the magnitude of
   greenhouse gas production by soil microbes. However, the effects of land
   use change on the production potential of methane (CH4) and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) in subtropical wetland soils and the underlying controls
   are still largely unknown. In this study, we examined the soil CH(4)and
   CO(2)production potentials under five different land use types (natural
   mangrove, Gei Wai water channel, Gei Wai forest, reedbed, and freshwater
   pond) and their relationships with soil physico-chemical properties in a
   subtropical wetland in Hong Kong using aerobic and anaerobic laboratory
   incubation experiments. Our results showed an overall decreasing trend
   of CH(4)and CO(2)production potentials down the soil profile at all
   sites, which could be attributed to a reduction in the concentrations of
   soil organic matter (SOM), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and ammonium
   nitrogen (NH4+-N). Moreover, the soil CH(4)and CO(2)production
   potentials varied significantly in the surface soils among land use
   types, but were more similar across the sites in the deeper soils. The
   conversion of natural mangrove to other land use types significantly
   reduced both the aerobic and anaerobic CO(2)production potentials in the
   top 10 cm soils, except for Gei Wai forest, which demonstrated
   significantly higher CO(2)production rates (61.15-97.91 mu g
   g(-1)day(-1)). Meanwhile, the mean CH(4)production potential in the
   surface soils of natural mangrove (0.05 mu g g(-1)d(-1)) was
   significantly lower than that in the Gei Wai forest and Gei Wai channel
   (0.26-0.27 mu g g(-1)day(-1)) but slightly higher than that in the
   freshwater pond and reedbed (0.00-0.02 mu g g(-1)day(-1)). The high soil
   CH(4)and CO(2)production potentials observed in the Gei Wai forest could
   be explained by the high soil concentrations of SOM, TKN and NH4+-N. On
   the other hand, the lower anaerobic CH(4)and aerobic CO(2)productions
   observed in the reedbed could be attributed to the lower concentrations
   of NH4+-N and available phosphorus. Our findings highlighted the
   significant impacts of land use types on the CH(4)and CO(2)production
   potentials of subtropical wetland soils, which had practical
   implications for wetland management for climate change mitigation.},

Title = {Nanomodification: An efficient method to improve cement integrity in CO2
   storage sites},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technology is an effective
   strategy to mitigate greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. One
   of the challenges of the CCS sites, however, is the degradation of class
   G cement used to seal-off the injected intervals. It is known that in
   the presence of brine in depleted reservoirs or aquifers, cement may
   degrade due to the interaction of its alkaline component (Portlandite)
   with carbonic acid, causing seepage of CO2 and environmental
   contamination. Given the surface area, stability and inhibition
   characteristics of nanomaterials, they might be a good option to improve
   the performance of the cement in CO2 storage sites. In this study,
   attempts are made to show how two reliable nanomaterials (Nano Glass
   Flakes (NGFs) and Multiwall Carbon Nano Tube (MWCNTs)) can be used to
   improve the integrity of the cement in CO2 storage sites. A series of
   pre-carbonation and post-carbonation tests were conducted on the cement
   samples modified by NGFs and MWCNTs to compare their performances under
   a real storage site condition. It was found that the samples with 0.5
   wt\% NGFs and 0.05 wt\% MWCNTs have the best performance against the
   attack of CO2. They could significantly resist against the carbonation
   and prevent the severe chemical reactions taking place in the presence
   of CO2. Given the fact that NGF is significantly cheaper than MWCNT, it
   could be a good choice to reinforce the cement used in the CCS storage
   site.},

Title = {Climate and land-use change impacts on potential solar photovoltaic

Abstract = {Climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon that has recently
   been greatly impacted by anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   One of the main contributing sectors to GHG emissions is the energy
   sector, due to its high dependency on fossil fuels. Renewable energy
   systems, notably solar energy, can be an effective climate change
   mitigation alternative. Photovoltaic (PV) technology provides an
   interesting method to produce electricity through a virtually infinite
   renewable resource at the human time scale: solar radiation.
   This study evaluates the current and future solar energy potential
   through the use of grid-connected PV power plants at the scale of
   countries within the Black Sea catchment. Simulated data are used to
   determine potential change in climate and land-use according to two
   different development scenarios. Incident solar radiation flux from
   re-analyses, spatial interpolation, and the application of the Delta
   change method are used to assess the current and future solar resource
   potential within this catchment. Potential sites suitable for PV power
   plants are selected following a Fuzzy logic approach, and thus the total
   potential solar energy through PV power generation can be determined.
   Results show that climate change will have little impact on the solar
   radiation resource, while land-use change induces more variability.
   However, regardless of the scenario followed, the solar energy potential
   is sufficient to provide an interesting contribution to the electricity
   generation mix of most countries within the Black Sea region. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Located in south-western Sweden, the Vastra Gotaland region is often
   seen as one of the areas of the country most vulnerable to flooding and
   erosion, and will be highly impacted by flooding and sea level rise as a
   result of climate change Drawing upon a literature study and
   semi-structured interviews with actors in climate policy, this chapter
   reviews the development of adaptation policy in Sweden The chapter
   focuses particularly on the Commission on Climate and Vulnerability
   (2007) and a government bill An Integrated Climate and Energy Policy
   Climate (2009) in which suggestions by the Commission were included The
   chapter describes the development of adaptation policy and measures on
   the regional and local levels in Vastra Gotaland and within select
   municipalities The study illustrates the national distribution of
   responsibility through which municipalities are given a large role in
   integrating adaptation measures, and describes some of the
   differentiated responses such responsibilities may elicit on the local
   level},

Title = {Is HIA the most effective tool to assess the impact on health of climate
   change mitigation policies at the local level? A case study in Geneva,
   Switzerland},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {5-15},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study aims to understand how the health dimension is integrated
   into four impact assessment tools used in Geneva, Switzerland:
   environmental impact assessment (EIA), strategic environmental
   assessment (SEA), sustainability assessment (SA) and health impact
   assessment (HIA). We have chosen as a case study greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions reduction policies chosen by the city of Geneva. The
   methodological approach consists in analysing EIA, SEA, SA and HIA
   conducted on three projects in three topic areas: urban planning,
   heating and transportation. These projects are: a complex urbanisation
   plan in an urban neighbourhood in Geneva (the Gare des Eaux-Vives
   project), a sustainable transportation plan for a central district in
   Geneva (the St-Gervais transportation project) and a strategy to
   encourage the City's employees to use sustainable transport for local
   business travel. The results show some shortcomings in the consideration
   of health in SEA, EIA and SA. This work highlights a narrow vision of
   health in SEA and EIA, limiting itself to a review of the effects of
   projects on the determinants of the physical environment as required by
   the legislation relating to these tools. EIA does not require the
   integration of the health dimension. As for SA, our research found that
   health is treated much more superficially than in HIA and primarily
   through the analysis of health and safety' criteria. It appears from
   this work that HIA is the tool which provides the most elaborate
   assessment, compared to SA, SEA or EIA, of the consequences for health
   of the GHG reduction policies chosen by the local decision-makers of a
   city. However, our study suggests that the HIA community should identify
   the situations in which HIA should be carried out and in which cases it
   is better to include health issues within an integrated analysis.},

Abstract = {This study is aimed to assess the impacts of various climate induced
   events and the sustainability of adoption of coping and adaptive
   measures against these impacts. The study was conducted through
   participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and focus group discussion (FGD) in
   three sites of Kalapara Upazila (Sub-district), located along the Bay of
   Bengal in Southwest Bangladesh. Finding suggests that although flooding,
   cyclones, storm surges, and seasonal droughts have different attributes,
   they have commonality in bringing severe salinity in soil, sub-soil
   water, and surface water bodies that severely affects the livelihood
   security of natural resource-dependent coastal population. Indigenous
   knowledge and diffusion of vernacular technologies have helped a large
   majority of people to adopt various coping and adaptation strategies
   against the salinity problem for long. However, in a changing nature of
   salinity (i.e. a discrete isolated event has been turning to a perpetual
   event), which is resulting from climate change induced sea level rise
   (CC-SLR), most of their adopted coping and adaptation measures have
   failed to address their livelihood security on a sustained basis. To
   bolster their efforts toward adoption of adaptation strategies for
   sustainable livelihood, a range of avenues for interventions are
   identified.},

Abstract = {Efforts to confront the challenges of environmental change and
   uncertainty include attempts to adaptively manage social-ecological
   systems. However, critical questions remain about whether adaptive
   management can lead to sustainable outcomes for both ecosystems and
   society. Here, we make a contribution to these efforts by presenting a
   16-y analysis of ecological outcomes and perceived livelihood impacts
   from adaptive coral reef management in Papua New Guinea. The adaptive
   management system we studied was a customary rotational fisheries
   closure system (akin to fallow agriculture), which helped to increase
   the biomass of reef fish and make fish less wary (more catchable)
   relative to openly fished areas. However, over time the amount of fish
   in openly fished reefs slowly declined. We found that, overall, resource
   users tended to have positive perceptions about this system, but there
   were negative perceptions when fishing was being prohibited. We also
   highlight some of the key traits of this adaptive management system,
   including 1) strong social cohesion, whereby leaders played a critical
   role in knowledge exchange; 2) high levels of compliance, which was
   facilitated via a ``carrot-and-stick{''} approach that publicly rewarded
   good behavior and punished deviant behavior; and 3) high levels of
   participation by community actors.},

Abstract = {The signing of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de
   Janeiro in June 1992 by 160 nations has firmly identified global climate
   change due to human pollution as a pressing global environmental
   concern. Among the responsibilities that the nations which ratify the
   Convention will have are the drawing up of inventories of greenhouse gas
   sources and sinks and the formulation of national strategies to respond
   to climate change through adaptive and/or preventive measures. One
   requirement for identifying appropriate response strategies will be the
   undertaking of regional assessments of climate change and its associated
   impacts.
   This paper is concerned with climate change in the East Asian region,
   both over the last 100 years (using instrumental data) and also for the
   next 100 years (using results from climate model experiments). The
   juxtaposing of these two analyses, historical and future, enables a
   better interpretation of the significance of regional climate change to
   be made. Instrumental temperature and precipitation data for the East
   Asian region are analysed and compared with the observed global-scale
   trends in these two variables. Although the region has undoubtedly
   warmed over the last century, understanding the exact causes of the
   complex seasonal, diurnal, and spatial dimensions of this warming is
   difficult. We examine the role of increasing urbanization in inducing
   rising temperatures and suggest that, although substantial, urban
   warming cannot account for all of the observed temperature change. The
   paper also illustrates a flexible composite-model approach to regional
   climate change scenario construction that avoids the need for multiple
   transient GCM experiments, which can explicitly incorporate the effects
   of intermodel uncertainty, and is flexible enough to incorporate new
   scientific findings and results from new GCM experiments. The scenario
   presented here suggests that by 2050, mean conditions are expected to be
   warmer than the extremely warm seasonal anomalies that occurred during
   the most recent decade in East Asia. Precipitation is estimated to rise
   over most of the region in all seasons, although the uncertainty range
   attached to this estimate is much wider than for temperature.},

Abstract = {Many different technologies exist to adapt to natural coastal hazards.
   These technologies can also play an important part in reducing
   vulnerability to climate change in coastal zones. Technologies are
   available to develop information and awareness for adaptation in coastal
   zones, to plan and design adaptation strategies, to implement them, and
   to monitor and evaluate their performance. This paper briefly describes
   these four steps and provides important examples of technologies that
   can be employed to accomplish them. In addition, it identifies three
   trends in coastal adaptation and associated technology use: (i) a
   growing recognition of the benefits of ``soft{''} protection and of the
   adaptation strategies retreat and accommodate, (ii) an increasing
   reliance on technologies to develop and manage information, and (iii) an
   enhanced awareness of the need for coastal adaptation to be appropriate
   for local natural and socio-economic conditions.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies for minimizing heat wave induced morbidity and its
   determinants},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {95-103},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Heat waves pose serious health threats to human mortality and morbidity
   in many countries, including Pakistan. There are various factors that
   contribute towards heat wave induced morbidity and several adaptation
   measures are at disposal to avoid adverse effects on human health. This
   research was designed to examine different adaptation measures taken by
   the respondents and to estimate the determinants of heat wave induced
   morbidity. The sampling design consisted of primary data collection from
   251 respondents in urban and peri-urban areas of Faisalabad, being one
   of the big cities in Pakistan, using a pre-tested questionnaire. The
   most common adaptation strategies were identified and an index of
   adaptation strategies was generated. The determinants of the number of
   patients in a family suffering from heat waves were estimated using
   Poisson regression model. The research findings revealed approximately
   the same adaptation scores of both urban and peri-urban respondents
   indicating no differences in adaptation level of both groups. The most
   commonly used adaptation strategies during heat waves included using
   plenty of water, and juices, increasing the number of baths, using an
   umbrella, cloth/cap, wearing sunglasses, and using green sheets/chicks
   in the house. The most important and statistically significant
   determinants of heat wave induced morbidity were the adaptation to heat
   waves (captured by adaptation score), urban/peri-urban background,
   family size, the number of males, and high income. Thus, it was
   concluded that the adaptation practices have strong health implications
   in the face of health challenges posed by heat waves. Based on the
   research findings, it is suggested that the health policies aimed at
   reducing the health impacts of heat waves may focus on awareness
   campaigns on available adaptation strategies through different media
   sources, widening access to health facilities, and extending swimming
   facilities particularly in urban areas. These strategies are important
   policy interventions to reduce vulnerability of population to heat
   waves.},

Journal = {AQUATIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Our understanding of how ecosystems function has changed from an
   equilibria-based view to one that recognizes the dynamic, fluctuating,
   nonlinear nature of aquatic systems. This current understanding requires
   that we manage systems for resilience. In this review, we examine how
   resilience has been defined, measured and applied in aquatic systems,
   and more broadly, in the socioecological systems in which they are
   embedded. Our review reveals the importance of managing stressors
   adversely impacting aquatic system resilience, as well as understanding
   the environmental and climatic cycles and changes impacting aquatic
   resources. Aquatic resilience may be enhanced by maintaining and
   enhancing habitat connectivity as well as functional redundancy and
   physical and biological diversity. Resilience in aquatic socioecological
   system may be enhanced by understanding and fostering linkages between
   the social and ecological subsystems, promoting equity among
   stakeholders, and understanding how the system is impacted by factors
   within and outside the area of immediate interest. Management for
   resilience requires implementation of adaptive and preferably
   collaborative management. Implementation of adaptive management for
   resilience will require an effective monitoring framework to detect key
   changes in the coupled socioecological system. Research is needed to (1)
   develop sensitive indicators and monitoring designs, (2) disentangle
   complex multi-scalar interactions and feedbacks, and (3) generalize
   lessons learned across aquatic ecosystems and apply them in new
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Because mangroves store greater amounts of carbon (C) per area than any
   other terrestrial ecosystem, conservation of mangrove forests on a
   global scale represents a potentially meaningful strategy for mitigating
   atmospheric greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. However, analyses of how
   coastal ecosystems influence the global C cycle also require the mapping
   of ecosystem area across the Earth's surface to estimate C storage and
   flux (movement) in order to compare how different ecosystem types may
   mitigate GHG enrichment in the atmosphere. In this paper, we propose a
   new framework based on diverse coastal morphology (that is, different
   coastal environmental settings resulting from how rivers, tides, waves,
   and climate have shaped coastal landforms) to explain global variations
   in mangrove C storage, using soil organic carbon (SOC) as a model to
   more accurately determine mangrove contributions to global C dynamics.
   We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first global mangrove area
   estimate occupying distinct coastal environmental settings, comparing
   the role of terrigenous and carbonate settings as global ``blue
   carbon{''} hotspots. C storage in deltaic settings has been
   overestimated, while SOC stocks in carbonate settings have been
   underestimated by up to 50\%. We encourage the scientific community,
   which has largely focused on blue carbon estimates, to incorporate
   coastal environmental settings into their evaluations of C stocks, to
   obtain more robust estimates of global C stocks.},

Abstract = {Air pollution is one of the most significant environmental hazards. The
   elderly, young, and poor are more vulnerable to air pollution. The risk
   of air pollution was assessed based on the risk framework published by
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in terms of three
   aspects: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. This study determined the
   concentrations of hazardous pollutants using satellite images from 2015
   at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. In addition, the study identified
   vulnerable groups who are exposed to hazardous air pollutants. The study
   highlighted the degree of vulnerability based on environmental
   sensitivity and institutional abilities, such as mitigation and social
   adaption policies, using statistical data. Based on the results, Seoul
   City and Gyeonggi Province have low air pollution risk owing to good
   institutional abilities, while the western coastal area has the highest
   air pollution risk. Three adaption pathway scenarios were assessed in
   terms of the effect of increases in the budget for social adaptation
   policies on the level of risk. The study found that the risk can be
   reduced when the social adaptation budget of 2015 base level is
   increased by 20\% in Gyeonggi Province and by 30\% in the western
   coastal area. In conclusion, this risk assessment can support
   policy-making to target more vulnerable groups based on scientific
   evidence and to ensure environmental justice at the national level.},

Title = {Symposium review: Effective nutritional strategies to mitigate enteric
   methane in dairy cattle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Number = {10},
Pages = {8543-8557},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Intensive research in the past decade has resulted in a better
   understanding of factors driving enteric methane (CH4) emissions in
   ruminants. Meta-analyses of large databases, developed through the
   GLOBAL NETWORK project, have identified successful strategies for
   mitigation of CH4 emissions. Methane inhibitors, alternative electron
   sinks, vegetable oils and oilseeds, and tanniferous forages are among
   the recommended strategies for mitigating CH4 emissions from dairy and
   beef cattle and small ruminants. These strategies were also effective in
   decreasing CH4 emissions yield and intensity. However, a higher
   inclusion rate of oils may negatively affect feed intake, rumen
   function, and animal performance, specifically milk components in dairy
   cows. In the case of nitrates (electron sinks), concerns with animal
   health may be impeding their adoption in practice, and potential
   emission trade-offs have to be considered. Tannins and tanniferous
   forages may have a negative effect on nutrient digestibility, and more
   research is needed to confirm their effects on overall animal
   performance in long-term experiments with high-producing animals. A
   meta-analysis of studies with dairy cows fed the CH4 inhibitor
   3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) at the Pennsylvania State University showed
   (1) a consistent 28 to 32\% decrease in daily CH4 emissions or emissions
   yield and intensity; (2) no effect on dry matter intake, milk
   production, body weight, or body weight change, and a slight increase in
   milk fat concentration and yield (0.19 percentage units and 90 g/d,
   respectively); 3-NOP also appears to increase milk urea nitrogen
   concentration; (3) an exponential decrease in the mitigation effect of
   the inhibitor with increasing its dose (from 40 to 200 mg/kg of feed dry
   matter, corresponding to 3-NOP intake of 1 to 4.8 g/ cow per day); and
   (4) a potential decrease in the efficacy of 3-NOP over time, which needs
   to be further investigated in long-term, full-lactation or
   multiple-lactation studies. The red macroalga Asparagopsis taxiformis
   has a strong CH4 mitigation effect, but studies are needed to determine
   its feasibility, long-term efficacy, and effects on animal production
   and health. We concluded that widespread adoption of mitigation
   strategies with proven effectiveness by the livestock industries will
   depend on cost, government policies and incentives, and willingness of
   consumers to pay a higher price for animal products with decreased
   carbon footprint.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cities face important overheating problems caused by the local and
   global climate change. Detailed mitigation and adaptation plans and
   strategies, are designed and applied to counterbalance the impact of the
   overheating challenges. Albedo management seems to be among the more
   considered mitigation strategies. A barrier to the wider use of
   reflecting technologies is the lack of quantitative experimental data
   and concrete knowledge about their mitigation contribution. Up to now,
   the performance of the reflective mitigation technologies is assessed
   based on simulation results considering the initial optical properties
   of the materials and neglecting ageing and weatherization phenomena. The
   article present information on the global performance of reflecting
   mitigation technologies, as measured in a large scale urban mitigation
   project employing several types of reflecting technologies. It is shown,
   that because of the weatherization effects, the mitigation potential of
   the materials is reduced, during the first year after their
   installation, by at least, 25\%. Despite the ageing effects, reflective
   pavements have found to contribute in reducing the peak summer ambient
   temperature up to 1,7 K, while their surface temperature was up to 12,3
   K lower than that of conventional pavement reducing considerably the
   sensible heat released to the atmosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Model-Based Policy Impact Assessment},

Abstract = {International shipping has finally set a target to reduce its CO2
   emission by at least 50\% by 2050. Despite this positive progress, this
   target is still not sufficient to reach Paris Agreement goals since CO2
   emissions from international shipping could reach 17\% of global
   emissions by 2050 if no measures are taken. A key factor that hampers
   the achievement of Paris goals is the knowledge gap in terms of what
   level of decarbonization it is possible to achieve using all the
   available technologies. This paper examines the technical possibility of
   achieving the 1.5 degrees goal of the Paris Agreement and the required
   supporting policy measures. We project the transport demand for 6 ship
   types (dry bulk, container, oil tanker, gas, wet product and chemical,
   and general cargo) based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation
   and Development's (OECD's) global trade projection of 25 commodities.
   Subsequently, we test the impact of mitigation measures on CO2 emissions
   until 2035 using an international freight transport and emission model.
   We present four possible decarbonization pathways which combine all the
   technologies available today. We found that an 82-95\% reduction in CO2
   emissions could be possible by 2035. Finally, we examine the barriers
   and the relevant policy measures to advance the decarbonization of
   international maritime transport.},

Abstract = {Climate change is affecting the life and livelihood of people all over
   the world, where Bangladesh is one of the most susceptible countries.
   Anthropogenic climate change is one of the consequences of an increase
   in the emission of greenhouse gases. Green building practice may be
   helpful in reducing the emissions. Focusing on the importance of green
   building and climate change, this study was conducted in Bangladesh to
   understand the potentiality of green building practice as an adaptation
   to climate change. To fulfill the objective, 21 key informant interviews
   and four in-depth interviews were conducted with experts from various
   government and non-government sectors in Bangladesh. From the findings,
   it has been revealed that design and construction efficiency, and
   reduction of energy use are the highest ranked indicators of green
   building, furthermore, environment-friendly design and construction, and
   long-term resource efficiency aspects should be included in the design
   and construction practices of Bangladesh. The consensus is that,
   buildings should be designed to be more energy-efficient. Besides, the
   efficient use of roof gardens, climate change mitigation, and long-term
   resiliencies are identified as the most highlighted sub-indicators from
   the economic and social perspectives of green building benefits in
   Bangladesh. Although several organizations are working on green
   buildings in Bangladesh, a majority of the experts (57\%) said the
   evaluating tools are not in place yet. Besides, public perceptions
   toward a new change and a lack of regulatory authorities are marked as
   major obstacles for implementing green building practices. Enforcing
   fair rules and regulations may aid in overcoming these challenges.},

Title = {Barriers and opportunities for social-ecological adaptation to climate
   change in coastal British Columbia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {179},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Climate change poses novel and complex challenges to planning,
   management, and policies for marine and coastal social-ecological
   systems. Despite ongoing discussion of adopting interventions for
   improving adaptation and adaptive capacity to climate change,
   practitioners often continue to carry out conventional management
   strategies that do not effectively incorporate climate change impacts
   and projections. Using a web-based survey and semi-structured
   interviews, we explored the perceptions of practitioners (coastal
   managers and planners) in British Columbia, Canada relative to climate
   change risks, adaptation actions for social and ecological systems, and
   barriers for adaptation within the region. Overall, practitioners shared
   a concern that climate change is not currently well incorporated in
   management or policy in this region, and noted significant
   implementation gaps. Practitioners expressed more support for ecological
   adaptation actions that are well suited to regional implementation, such
   as incorporating climate change projections into management and reducing
   fisheries over-exploitation, than for actions such as protecting
   specific areas. Social adaptation actions were overall perceived as less
   useful than ecological adaptation actions, and actions that would
   support local management and monitoring efforts were viewed as more
   useful than developing alternative livelihoods. The main barriers and
   associated opportunities for climate change adaptation in marine
   management included political action, reducing scientific uncertainty,
   improving communication, and increasing capacity (both funding and
   staff). Additional opportunities include effective engagement with
   Indigenous governance, improving policies and funding for adaptation
   including monitoring, and focusing efforts on communication and
   education programs specific to practitioners and communities. This study
   demonstrates the necessity of collaboration across scales of management
   for effective climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Identifying and prioritising adaptation options for a coastal freshwater
   supply and demand system under climatic and non-climatic changes},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Coastal freshwater supply and demand systems are expected to be
   significantly affected by changes to both climatic and non-climatic
   drivers over coming decades. Adapting to these changes to secure
   adequate freshwater to meet the rising demands of socio-economic
   development has become a critical task for decision-makers. Whilst a
   range of adaptation options may be available, the complexity and
   interconnectedness of water resource systems make it challenging to
   identify which options are likely to be most feasible and effective.
   Here, we present a Bayesian decision network (BDN) that was co-developed
   with local experts to identify appropriate adaptation options for
   freshwater management under both current and likely future conditions in
   the Da Do Basin of coastal Vietnam. Potential adaptation options were
   prioritised according to cost-effectiveness based on relative costs
   incurred and relative utilities delivered across a range of future
   scenarios. The BDN model indicated that cost-effectiveness of adaptation
   options varied between future scenarios. Constructing pumping stations
   was the most cost-effective option under climate change scenarios,
   whilst a higher water price was the most cost-effective option under
   non-climatic changes. Under combined climatic and non-climatic changes,
   constructing pumping stations in combination with increasing water
   prices provided the most cost-effective option. The model affords an
   opportunity for decision-makers in the Da Do Basin to prioritise and
   evaluate appropriate and feasible adaptation actions under different
   scenarios with respect to multiple drivers.},

Abstract = {Background: Natural climate solutions (NCS)-actions to conserve,
   restore, and modify natural and modified ecosystems to increase carbon
   storage or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-are increasingly
   regarded as important pathways for climate change mitigation, while
   contributing to our global conservation efforts, overall planetary
   resilience, and sustainable development goals. Recently, projections
   posit that terrestrial-based NCS can potentially capture or avoid the
   emission of at least 11 Gt (gigatons) of carbon dioxide equivalent a
   year, or roughly encompassing one third of the emissions reductions
   needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals by 2030. NCS
   interventions also purport to provide co-benefits such as improved
   productivity and livelihoods from sustainable natural resource
   management, protection of locally and culturally important natural
   areas, and downstream climate adaptation benefits. Attention on
   implementing NCS to address climate change across global and national
   agendas has grown-however, clear understanding of which types of NCS
   interventions have undergone substantial study versus those that require
   additional evidence is still lacking. This study aims to conduct a
   systematic map to collate and describe the current state, distribution,
   and methods used for evidence on the links between NCS interventions and
   climate change mitigation outcomes within tropical and sub-tropical
   terrestrial ecosystems. Results of this study can be used to inform
   program and policy design and highlight critical knowledge gaps where
   future evaluation, research, and syntheses are needed.
   Methods: To develop this systematic map, we will search two
   bibliographic databases (including 11 indices) and 67 organization
   websites, backward citation chase from 39 existing evidence syntheses,
   and solicit information from key informants. All searches will be
   conducted in English and encompass subtropical and tropical terrestrial
   ecosystems (forests, grasslands, mangroves, agricultural areas). Search
   results will be screened at title and abstract, and full text levels,
   recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for
   exclusion. Key meta-data from included articles will be coded and
   reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the
   evidence base, assess gaps in knowledge, and provide insights for
   policy, practice, and research. The data from this systematic map will
   be made open access.},

Title = {Impacts of emission reductions on aerosol radiative effects},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Pages = {5501-5519},
Abstract = {The global aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ was used to investigate
   changes in the aerosol burden and aerosol radiative effects in the
   coming decades. Four different emissions scenarios were applied for 2030
   (two of them applied also for 2020) and the results were compared
   against the reference year 2005. Two of the scenarios are based on
   current legislation reductions: one shows the maximum potential of
   reductions that can be achieved by technical measures, and the other is
   targeted to short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). We have analyzed the
   results in terms of global means and additionally focused on eight
   subregions. Based on our results, aerosol burdens show an overall
   decreasing trend as they basically follow the changes in primary and
   precursor emissions. However, in some locations, such as India, the
   burdens could increase significantly. The declining emissions have an
   impact on the clear-sky direct aerosol effect (DRE), i.e. the cooling
   effect. The DRE could decrease globally 0.06-0.4 W m(-2) by 2030 with
   some regional increases, for example, over India (up to 0.84 W m(-2)).
   The global changes in the DRE depend on the scenario and are smallest in
   the targeted SLCF simulation. The aerosol indirect radiative effect
   could decline 0.25-0.82 W m(-2) by 2030. This decrease takes place
   mostly over the oceans, whereas the DRE changes are greatest over the
   continents. Our results show that targeted emission reduction measures
   can be a much better choice for the climate than overall high reductions
   globally. Our simulations also suggest that more than half of the
   near-future forcing change is due to the radiative effects associated
   with aerosol-cloud interactions.},

Title = {A new framework for rapidly assessing national adaptation policies: an
   application to small island developing states in the Atlantic and Indian
   Oceans},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Adapting to climate change is becoming a routine and necessary component
   of planning at all levels. In the case of small island developing states
   (SIDS), the successful development, implementation and evaluation of
   national-level adaptation policies are especially important because of
   their disproportionate vulnerability. The status of adaptation policies
   in these countries, however, is poorly understood and documented,
   particularly for the Atlantic, Indian Oceans, Mediterranean and South
   China Seas (AIMS) region. This is so largely because of minimal
   mainstream research interest in these small nations. This paper helps
   fill this gap. It develops an Adaptation Policy Assessment Framework
   that facilitates a rapid qualitative assessment of countries' national
   adaptation policies. It applies the framework to seven representative
   policies across six of the nine SIDS in the AIMS region-Comoros,
   Guinea-Bissau, Maldives, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles and
   Singapore. It finds that countries are mostly successful in identifying
   climate and climate-related vulnerabilities and linking associated risks
   to other national development priorities such as poverty reduction.
   Countries, however, struggle with establishing and maintaining systems
   to review and improve adaptation interventions, which is not entirely
   unique to them or their circumstances. This paper's findings provide
   critical points of reflection for countries preparing and revising their
   National Adaptation Plans in the context of the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change. They also contribute to a broader
   understanding of the complexities of climate policy development in small
   jurisdictions.},

Title = {Investigating flood resilience perceptions and supporting collective
   decision-making through fuzzy cognitive mapping},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {837},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Improving flood resilience of communities requires a holistic
   understanding of risks and resilience options as well as the preferences
   and priorities of different stakeholders. Innovations in risk and
   resilience assessment have helped communities to identify gaps in their
   flood risk management strategy but selecting and implementing resilience
   solutions remains a big challenge for many decision-makers. In addition
   to traditional appraisals and cost-benefit assessments this also calls
   for a participatory process in which various stakeholders are encouraged
   to adopt a system-level approach in identifying interventions that can
   maximise a range of benefits and co-benefits. In this study, we
   investigate how a combination of modelling and measurement methods can
   help decision-makers with their flood resilience strategies. We apply a
   participatory system thinking approach combining Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping
   (FCM) with a flood resilience measurement framework called Flood
   Resilience Measurement for Communities (FRMC). We first investigate
   stakeholders' biases on flood resilience interventions, and then lead
   them through a system thinking exercise using FCM and FRMC to elicit
   mental models representing important aspects of flood resilience and
   their interrelation. These are then aggregated, representing the
   collective perceptions and knowledge of stakeholders, and used to
   identify the most beneficial resilience actions in terms of direct and
   indirect impacts on flood resilience. We apply this approach to the case
   of Lowestoft, a coastal town in England exposed to significant flood
   risk. Developed in close collaboration with the local authorities, the
   ambition is to support decision-making on flood resilience
   interventions. We find that this combination of methods enables
   system-level thinking and inclusive decision-making about flood
   resilience which can ultimately encourage transformative decisions on
   prioritization of actions and investments.},

Title = {Major Expansion of Marine Forests in a Warmer Arctic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Accelerating warming and associated loss of sea ice are expected to
   promote the expansion of coastal marine forests (macrophytes) along the
   massive Arctic coastlines. Yet, this region has received much less
   attention compared to other global oceans. The available future
   projections of Arctic macrophytes are still limited to few species and
   regions, and mostly focused at lower latitude ranges, thus precluding
   well-informed IPCC impact assessments, conservation and management. Here
   we aim to quantify potential distributional changes of Arctic intertidal
   and subtidal brown macroalgae and eelgrass by the year 2100, relative to
   present. We estimate habitat suitability by means of species
   distribution modeling, considering changes in seawater temperature,
   salinity, nutrients and sea ice cover under two greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios, one consistent with the Paris Agreement (RCP 2.6) and the
   other representing limited mitigation strategies (RCP 8.5). As data on
   substrate conditions do not exist, the models were restricted to the
   depth range supporting Arctic macrophytes (down to 5 m for eelgrass and
   30 m for brown macroalgae). Models projected major expansions of Arctic
   macrophytes between 69,940 and 123,360 km(2), depending on the climate
   scenario, with polar distribution limits shifting northwards by up to
   1.5 latitude degrees at 21.81 km per decade. Such expansions in response
   to changing climate will likely elicit major changes in biodiversity and
   ecosystem functions in the future Arctic. Expansions are, however, less
   intense than those already realized over the past century, indicating an
   overall slowing down despite accelerated warming as habitats become
   increasingly occupied.},

   interplay between formal and everyday climate change adaptations},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly widespread and intense. In response,
   formal adaptation efforts are gaining momentum and financing globally,
   while those affected address felt changes through a variety of everyday
   adaptations, the aggregate daily practices articulated in response to
   ongoing social-ecological change. Our research examined the interplay
   between formal and everyday adaptations in practice. Specifically, we
   sought to shed light on the tendency emerging in adaptation literature
   of what we term interrupted agency, where formal adaptation
   interventions interrupt everyday adaptation strategies-and agency-of
   local actors, potentially leading to maladaptation. We did so in North
   Central Vietnam, where climate change is disrupting lives and
   livelihoods, and numerous formal and everyday adaptation measures are
   being implemented in response. We examined three key climate-affected
   sectors, agriculture, water management, and coastal management, drawing
   on existing literature as well as interviews and document and policy
   review. We found that differences in formal and everyday adaptations can
   indeed lead to interrupted agency yet, in some instances, also support
   complementarities and even transformative change. Such outcomes required
   dialogue and pluralistic input to adaptation -related policy, practice,
   and decision-making, underlining the importance of attention to
   participation, representation, and influence in decision-making in
   adaptation efforts. Our exploration of the concepts of everyday
   adaptation and interrupted agency illustrates that these can valuably
   contribute to adaptation literature, particularly on the politics of
   adaptation.},

Title = {Review and evaluation of three mitigation measures - bird-scaring line,
   underwater setting and line shooter - to reduce seabird bycatch in the
   north Atlantic longline fishery},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-16},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Seabirds scavenge baits from the hooks of commercial longlines,
   resulting in incidental seabird mortality and bait loss. As interactions
   between seabirds and longline fishing may cause seabird populations to
   decline and reduce gear efficiency, the potential of various mitigation
   measures to solve this problem has been tested. Four fishing experiments
   were conducted in commercial longlining in the north Atlantic to
   investigate the effectiveness of a bird-scaring line, underwater setting
   and a line shooter in reducing seabird bycatch during longline setting.
   These results are reviewed and the performance of the mitigation
   measures is evaluated. The great majority of the birds caught were
   northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis). Accidental catches of birds were
   reduced by all three methods, most clearly by the bird-scaring line. A
   total of 185 000 hooks were set with this mitigation measure in place,
   and only two birds were caught compared with 205 for control lines with
   a similar number of hooks set without any mitigation measure. The
   experiments also reduced bait loss and increased target species catch
   rates when mitigation measures were used. Increased catch rates are
   important incentives for fishermen to employ mitigation measures. It is
   concluded that the bird-scaring line is the most feasible and effective

Abstract = {Coastal agriculture and livelihoods worldwide are highly vulnerable to
   changing climates, and Bangladesh is no exception due to its geophysical
   location. This paper examines rice farmers' vulnerability, adaptation
   strategies, and adaptation barriers to managing climate change impacts
   in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Survey data were collected from 220
   randomly selected rice farmers located across two coastal districts of
   Bangladesh. A multinomial logit model was applied to analyze
   determinants of adaptation strategies of rice farmers. The results
   reveal that flood is the main risk to vulnerability, followed by
   cyclones and storms surges and saline intrusion. The main adaptation
   strategies are cultivating flood and salinity tolerant rice varieties,
   direct seeding of rice, supplementary irrigation, cultivation of
   non-rice crops that have shorter growth duration, and rearing of
   livestock, poultry, and duck. The econometric analysis shows that
   factors such as household head's education, household income, farm size,
   access to information, and extension services significantly influence
   the choice of adaptation strategies of the rice farmers. We recommend to
   increase investment in research, training of farmers, and targeted
   extension services to disseminate climate-smart technologies and
   information for minimising vulnerability of the farmers.},

Title = {Fingerprinting Blue Carbon: Rationale and Tools to Determine the Source
   of Organic Carbon in Marine Depositional Environments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that
   is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and
   increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to
   mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially
   seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon
   hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic
   carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and
   conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon
   sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by
   knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique
   current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the
   provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes,
   compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and
   environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used
   bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot
   distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic
   carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we
   recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular,
   the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a
   great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of
   different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine
   ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques,
   further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can
   inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the
   implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.},

Abstract = {The climate of a city influences the ways in which its outdoor spaces
   are used. Especially public spaces intended for use by pedestrians and
   cyclists, such as parks, squares, residential and shopping streets,
   foot-paths and cycle-paths will be used and enjoyed more frequently when
   they have a comfortable and healthy climate. Due to a predicted global
   temperature rise, the climate is likely to be more uncomfortable
   especially in summer, when an increase in heat stress is expected.
   `Urban forestry' has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human
   health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate
   change. The aims of the research are: to provide a transferable
   methodology useful to analyze the effect of urban trees on the reduction
   surface temperature particularly in public spaces; to provide
   high-resolution urban mapping for adaptation strategies to climate
   change based on green space projects. The results identified that the
   main project dimensions on which to base climate adaptation strategies
   is the design of efficient public green spaces. In conclusion, the
   proposed model was used to validate the efficiency of the design
   simulations of new green spaces in temperature mitigation.},

   from 240 climate finance recipient households and 120 non-climate

   recipient households engaged in more adaptation measures, they also
   spend more on adaptation from their income, savings and even loans. Some
   underlying constraints for households to access climate finance were
   identified. Finally, mislabelling regular poverty reduction activities

Abstract = {Increasing the generation of renewable energies to reduce the
   consumption of fossil fuels that produce high concentration of
   greenhouse gases is the priority that several governments have set for
   themselves in the medium term. In this paper, the modeling of a solar
   thermal energy generation plant is carried out. The climatic data
   correspond to two coastal cities and an island in Ecuador. The main
   contribution is the simulation of a complete model of solar collector
   fields and power conversion systems, in which the variables of output
   temperature and oil flow intervene at the same time. Previous research
   uses only the outlet temperature to evaluate the power plants. The model
   of the solar thermal plant is composed of a solar collector field, a
   storage tank, and an energy conversion system. As a result, a model of a
   solar thermal plant is obtained that allows to make decisions when
   considering the incorporation of microgrids in electrical systems
   isolated. The use of solar thermal technology allows to reduce the risk
   of spills from the transport of fossil fuels on ships. In addition, the
   CO(2)emissions involved in the construction, operation, and maintenance
   of a solar thermal power plant are detailed.},

Abstract = {Climate-related disasters such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts
   are not new to Pacific Islanders, who have developed customary or
   `traditional' practices to enable communities to adapt and recover from
   such hazards. Some of these practices have been degraded and some
   assisted by modernisation. Through their effects on the island
   environment, these hazards have a range of socio-economic impacts on
   food (fisheries and crops) and water supply, tourism, and coastal
   buildings and infrastructure. The varied impacts of climate change not
   only exacerbate those hazards but also raise new threats, such as sea
   level rise and ocean acidification, that have no precedent in the past
   500 years, and for which there are therefore no traditional adaptations,
   although Pacific innate ingenuity and resilience remains strong. These
   issues are particularly acute for the low-lying atoll countries whose
   continued existence is threatened by sea level rise, but also affect
   those that live on higher islands in coastal settlements, where most of
   their population is concentrated. Climate change thus sharpens social
   and cultural issues of equity (reflecting disparities in location,
   income, education, gender, health and age), made even more acute by
   increased levels of voluntary or forced migration within, and even more
   so beyond, island country boundaries. Consequently, many islanders see
   climate change as a moral challenge to the richer countries to reduce
   their greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the problem.},

Title = {Adsorption behavior and mechanism of CO2 in the Longmaxi shale gas

Abstract = {CO2 is the main greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere, and has been
   causing global warming since the industrial revolution. Therefore,
   technologies to mitigate carbon emissions have attracted extensive
   research. Shale gas reservoirs could serve as potential sequestration
   space for CO2. This paper aims to gain insight in the CO2 adsorption
   behavior and mechanism in longmaxi shale. The micropore filling theory
   is the best model for CO2 adsorption in the shale samples with the
   smallest MSR (Mean Square of Residual). This model fits better than that
   of the monolayer adsorption and multi-layer adsorption theories.
   Specifically, micropore filling adsorption mainly occurs in micropores,
   including the dosed end of slit pores, capillary pores, and ink-shaped
   pores. Molecular Layer adsorption mainly occurs in mesopores and
   macropores, including the open end of slit pores, plate pores, capillary
   pores, and inkshaped pores. Moreover, the prediction model of CO2
   storage quantity in deep shale gas reservoirs of China is established.
   This model shows that 91.5-388.89 x 10 12 m(3) of CO2 could in theory be
   stored in an adsorbed state. CO2 is mostly stored by an adsorbed state
   (higher than 95\%) and a free state with good security and low leakage
   risk. The results from this work are of specific interest for global
   research on CO2 adsorption characteristics and adsorption mechanisms in
   different pore structures. Furthermore, it provides certain guidance for
   geological storage of CO2 in shale.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a risk-cost-benefit based framework to assess the
   potential hurricane damage risks to residential construction and
   investigate the cost-effectiveness of different adaptation strategies
   under various wind speed change scenarios due to climate change. It is
   estimated that hurricanes caused \$6 billion annually in the US in
   recent years. Changes in hurricane intensity or/and frequency may be
   expected due to the changing climate. This paper proposes a framework to
   refine hurricane risk assessment by accounting for the impacts the
   changing climate may have on hurricane intensity and/or frequency.
   Various adaptation strategies will be developed in an attempt to
   mitigate damage costs. Three case study locations (Miami-Dade County,
   New Hanover County, Galveston County) are presented. This study finds
   that climate change may have a substantial impact on damage estimation
   in coastal areas, and that certain adaptation strategies can
   cost-effectively decrease the damage.},

Title = {Negative emissions-Part 2: Costs, potentials and side effects},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The most recent IPCC assessment has shown an important role for negative
   emissions technologies (NETs) in limiting global warming to 2 degrees C
   cost-effectively. However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and
   transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2
   from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part
   review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant
   literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy
   with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and
   reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced
   weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration.
   In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs,
   potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them
   with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling
   challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable
   climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the
   literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in
   2050 are 0.5-3.6 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for afforestation and reforestation,
   0.5-5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for BECCS, 0.5-2GtCO(2) yr(-1) for biochar, 2-4
   GtCO(2) yr(-1) for enhanced weathering, 0.5-5 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for DACCS,
   and up to 5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary
   widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative
   potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to
   sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated
   assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 degrees C of global warming.},

Abstract = {It is clear that the most effective way to limit global temperature rise
   and associated impacts is to reduce human emissions of greenhouse gases,
   including methane. However, quantification of the climate benefits of
   mitigation options are complicated by the contrast in the timescales at
   which short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane, persist in the
   atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide. Whereas simple metrics fail to
   capture the differential impacts across all timescales, sophisticated
   climate models that can address these temporal dynamics are often
   inaccessible, time-intensive, require special infrastructure, and
   include high unforced interannual variability that makes it difficult to
   analyse small changes in forcings. On the other hand, reduced-complexity
   climate models that use basic knowledge from observations and complex
   Earth system models offer an ideal compromise in that they provide
   quick, reliable insights into climate responses, with only limited
   computational infrastructure needed. They are particularly useful for
   simulating the response to forcings of small changes in different
   climate pollutants, due to the absence of internal variability. In this
   paper, we build on previous evaluations of the freely available and
   easy-to-run reduced-complexity climate model MAGICC by comparing
   temperature responses to historical methane emissions to those from a
   more complex coupled global chemistry-climate model, GFDL-CM3. While we
   find that the overall forcings and temperature responses are comparable
   between the two models, the prominent role of unforced variability in
   CM3 demonstrates how sophisticated models are potentially inappropriate
   tools for small forcing scenarios. On the other hand, we find that
   MAGICC can easily and rapidly provide robust data on climate responses
   to changes in methane emissions with clear signals unfettered by
   variability. We are therefore able to build confidence in using
   reduced-complexity climate models such as MAGICC for purposes of
   understanding the climate implications of methane mitigation.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our times, even
   before the onset of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. One of the main
   contributors to climate change is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which
   are mostly caused by human activities such as the burning of fossil
   fuels. As the lockdown due to the pandemic has minimised human activity
   in major cities, GHG emissions have been reduced. This, in turn, is
   expected to lead to a reduction in the urban heat island (UHI) effect in
   the cities. The aim of this paper is to understand the relationship
   between human activity and the UHI intensity and to provide
   recommendations towards developing a sustainable approach to minimise
   the UHI effect and improve urban resilience. In this study, historical
   records of the monthly mean of daily maximum surface air temperatures
   collected from official weather stations in Melbourne, New York City,
   Tokyo, Dublin, and Oslo were used to estimate the UHI intensity in these
   cities. The results showed that factors such as global climate and
   geographic features could dominate the overall temperature. However, a
   direct relationship between COVID-19 lockdown timelines and the UHI
   intensity was observed, which suggests that a reduction in human
   activity can diminish the UHI intensity. As lockdowns due to COVID-19
   are only temporary events, this study also provides recommendations to
   urban planners towards long-term measures to mitigate the UHI effect,
   which can be implemented when human activity returns to normal.},

Title = {Household response to cyclone and induced surge in coastal Bangladesh:
   coping strategies and explanatory variables},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to explore indigenous coping strategies
   and identify underlying demographic, socio-economic and other relevant
   variables that influence the adoption of coping strategies in three
   distinct cyclone-prone coastal villages of Bangladesh. The study finds
   that cyclones and induced surges are a recurrent phenomenon in coastal
   Bangladesh; hence people are used to adjusting their lifestyle and
   adopting their own coping strategies intelligently. Adoption of a
   particular set of coping strategies depends not only on the magnitude,
   intensity and potential impacts of the cyclone and induced surge, but
   also age, gender, social class, dissemination of early warning
   information, locational exposure, external assistance, social protection
   and informal risk sharing mechanisms within the community. Indigenous
   cyclone disaster prevention and mitigation strategies significantly
   minimize the vulnerability of the people. Under extreme situations, when
   such disasters surpass the shock-bearing capacity of the victims,
   informal risk sharing mechanisms through social bonding and social
   safety-nets become vital for short-term survival and long-term
   livelihood security. Therefore, proper monitoring and understanding of
   local indigenous coping strategies are essential in order to target the
   most vulnerable groups exposed to disasters. Additionally, proper
   dissemination of early warning and government and non-government
   partnerships for relief and rehabilitation activities should be
   prioritized to ensure pro-poor disaster management activities. The study
   also recommends effective monitoring of the impact of aid to ensure
   corrective measures to avoid the development of relief dependency by
   disaster victims.},

Title = {Vulnerability of Fishing Communities from Sea-Level Change: A Study of
   Laemsing District in Chanthaburi Province, Thailand},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Continuous increases in global mean sea level is affecting coastal
   communities worldwide. In Thailand, the rising sea level exacerbates the
   vulnerability of coastal communities to changes in geographic conditions
   seriously affecting communities with low adaptive capacity and mostly
   dependent on natural resources. This paper identifies the potential
   vulnerability of coastal fishing communities which are prone to severe
   sea-level rises, like in the case of Laemsing District in Chanthaburi
   Province, Thailand. Climate simulation, Geographic Information System
   (GIS) and remote sensing techniques were applied to quantify potential
   sea-level change (exposure), inundated areas and affected households
   (sensitivity). Adaptive capacity was analyzed in terms of social, human,
   institutional, economic, and natural conditions. Based on A1F1 (the
   worst case of future greenhouse gas emissions) and the Goddard Institute
   for Space Studies model EH (GISS-EH) best estimate for 2050, relative
   sea-level increase from 2000 would be 0.50 m, resulting in a loss of
   about 87.77 km(2) of land and inundation of 2060 households. Opinions on
   alleviating vulnerability suggested that each condition of vulnerability
   is associated with two stages of development, urgent and medium.
   Laemsing District can face the serious effects of seawater inundation in
   the future. The results of this paper could be appropriately used as a
   reference for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development
   policies and raising the awareness of stakeholders on how to cope with
   sea-level change and its impacts.},

Abstract = {Cities are major sources of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and the
   effects of mass urbanization upon the environment have now become clear.
   Great opportunities exist within cities for tackling climate change.
   Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a phenomenon where significant
   temperature difference between inner micro-climates of a city and their
   neighboring micro-climates can be perceived. Mitigation of UHI effects
   can positively contribute to alleviate detriments of climate change.
   This research project aims to investigate effective and resilient UHI
   mitigation strategies and to provide guidance for their application in
   future. A review of literature indicates that UHI is a growing problem
   in the UK and that mitigation of such effects would enhance sustainable
   development at urban scale. The lack of guidance for designers and
   planners looking into mitigating the UHI effect is also identified.
   Utilizing ENVI-met simulations and through Urban Futures Assessment
   Method (UFAM), this research identifies and tests resilient and
   effective UHI mitigation strategies. Results show that building form,
   orientation and layout are among the most effective UHI mitigation
   strategies. Trees, shrubs and grass (TSG), and use of high albedo
   materials (HAM) in external building surfaces are also indicated as
   effective measures whose success is dependent on building form. All
   assessed mitigation strategies (TSG, HAM, UIWB) are shown to have a
   similar level of resilience which could be improved if properly
   future-proofed against subsequent changes. Accordingly some practical
   suggestions are provided to help improve the resilience of tested UHI
   mitigation strategies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Impacts of Climate Change on Outdoor Recreation Participation: Outlook
   to 2060},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {97-120},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Natural resource managers and planners must consider outdoor
   recreation's long-run response to shifting population density,
   sociodemographic factors, land uses, and climate change. Projected rises
   in greenhouse gases imply changing minimum/maximum temperatures,
   potential evapotranspiration, and precipitation. The strong link between
   natural resource conditions and outdoor recreation suggests that
   long-and short-term recreation planning requires knowledge of which
   activities and settings will be impacted by climate change. Climate
   change response is principally an adaptation strategy, as climate cannot
   be directly managed like park access. Effective planning requires that
   adaptation or mitigation strategies should be considered for activities
   and implemented in advance.
   We used a two-step approach. The estimation step yielded models of adult
   participation rates and days-per-participant by activity at regional and
   national levels. The simulation step combined models with external
   projections of explanatory variables at 10-year intervals to 2060.
   Estimates of per capita participation and days-of-participation were
   combined with population projections to estimate participants and
   participant-days by activity. Regional and national projections through
   2060 were made under three 2010 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment
   scenarios, varying in population growth rates, socioeconomic conditions,
   and land uses. Adding in a climate variable generated a second set of
   projections, accounting for changing temperature, precipitation, or
   potential evapotranspiration. Nested models allowed comparing the
   results with and without the climate change, the primary focus of this
   paper.
   Climate change impacts within each scenario were computed using the
   differences in participation and consumption metrics with and without
   climate effects, expressed as a percentage relative to 2008 baselines.
   This computation included the magnitude of change between the 2060
   futures with and without climate change, as well as impacts relative to
   the baseline. A range of plausible climate-related shifts in
   participation and consumption was created by collapsing scenarios and
   climate models by activity. We focused on sensitivity to climate change,
   as projections of activity participation and consumption are already
   detailed elsewhere (Bowker et al., 2012; Bowker et al., 2013; Bowker \&
   Askew, 2013; Bowker \& Askew, 2014).
   Recreation will respond differently to warmer futures, increasing
   potential evapotranspiration, and mixed precipitation outlooks by
   activity, location, and for participation versus consumption.
   Snowmobiling and undeveloped skiing (cross-country skiing and
   snowshoeing) were the most negatively affected by climate change.
   Participation in horseback riding on trails could increase. Horseback
   riding days-of-participation could see negative climate impacts
   nationally. Participation and days-of-participation for both fishing and
   motorized water activities in the North should increase. Climate change
   in the Rocky Mountain region will negatively impact motorized water
   activities, hunting, and fishing, while swimming should be affected
   positively. The Pacific Coast region shows the most stability, with
   either small climate-induced shifts or wider ranges which are ambiguous.},

Title = {Tourism and climate change: a review of threats and adaptation
   strategies for Africa},
Journal = {CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {7},
Pages = {742-759},
Abstract = {The intersection of tourism and climate change has seen significant
   research over the past two decades, focusing particularly on issues of
   mitigation and adaptation in the global North. Research output has
   predominantly been centred on the Mediterranean and Nordic countries and
   number of localities in North America. The global South has seen
   significantly less investigation, despite having significantly lower
   adaptive capacity to the impacts of climate change, and numerous
   countries with rapidly growing tourism sectors. The African continent
   specifically has seen appreciably less research than other countries in
   the global South, despite arguably having the lowest adaptive capacity
   and projections of severe impacts of climate change to the tourism
   sector from temperature increases, changes in precipitation volume and
   sea level rise. This paper therefore presents a review of the existing
   literature on adaptation strategies of tourism sectors and participants
   in African countries. The crucial argument of this paper is in
   highlighting the need for an increase in research into the threats of
   climate change to tourism in African countries, identifying future
   research trajectories. The development of such knowledge would assist in
   the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for these most
   vulnerable tourism economies.},

Title = {Dissemination and perception of adaptation co-benefits: Insights from
   the coastal area of Bangladesh},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The assessment and evaluation of co-benefits related to climate change
   policy has shifted from a mitigationcentric approach to also include
   adaptation. In 2017, the 23rd Conference of the Parties of the United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change requested that Parties
   submit proposals for assessing adaptation co-benefits along with their
   adaptation and resilience strategies. However, adaptation co-benefits
   are not always noticed during the initial stage of risk reduction
   measures, and this can become a bottleneck for intervention. Against
   this backdrop, this research aims to explore how stakeholders recognize
   and communicate the co-benefits of adaptation interventions, by
   conducting a case study of Barguna Sadar, a shoreline upazila
   (subdistrict) in the southern part of Bangladesh that is highly
   vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This qualitative study
   involved focus group discussions and interviews with stakeholders. The
   results revealed a lack of awareness and understanding of adaptation
   co-benefits among community members, especially the intended
   beneficiaries, related to projects implemented by local and
   international non-government organizations. Insufficient communication
   prior to the implementation of adaptation projects was found to be the
   underlying cause of this lack of awareness. Improving public awareness
   of adaptation co-benefits has the potential to overcome the challenges
   posed by the adaptation paradox.},

Title = {Adaptation analysis for environmental change in coastal communities},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {34-45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Small islands and coastal communities around the world are particularly
   vulnerable to climate change impacts, mainly from storm surge attributed
   to more frequent and severe coastal storms, and mounting sea-level rise.
   Coastal hazards including inundation, salinisation of the water supply,
   and land erosion all threaten vital infrastructure that support coastal
   communities. This research, part of the International
   Community-University Research Alliance (ICURA) C-Change project
   ``Managing Adaptation to Environmental Change in Coastal Communities:
   Canada and the Caribbean{''}, develops and applies a multicriteria
   decision evaluation and support system for evaluating adaptation options
   for coastal communities. The paper estimates vulnerability, resilience,
   and adaptive capacity measures associated with adaptation strategies in
   coastal communities with respect to their environmental, economic,
   social, and cultural dimensions. Results are determined using a
   multi-participant formulation of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)
   for identifying multicriteria decisions as adaptation strategies in a
   specific coastal context. The application of the framework is conducted
   for the coastal community of Little Anse on Isle Madame, Nova Scotia.
   Specifically, the state of the Little Anse breakwater is analysed and
   adaptation options for protecting, accommodating, and retreating are
   presented and evaluated in the face of predicted storm scenarios. The
   results indicate that, in the case of Little Anse, the strategic
   decision to protect the community by a new breakwater arm provides
   preferred measures for resilience and adaptive capacity. (C) 2015

Title = {Fishing operations and adaptive strategies of small-scale fishers:
   insights for fisheries management in data-poor situations},
Journal = {FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries' management is complex given its multigear,
   multispecies nature; despite this, fishing effort has usually been
   controlled by nominal units, ignoring changes in effective fishing
   effort. This study aimed to understand the adaptive strategies of
   small-scale fishers in San Felipe, Yucatan, Mexico through an analysis
   of their fishing operations. Minor changes in trip numbers among three
   seasons were observed, but increases in fishing time, depth and travel
   costs from one season to another at the operational level were found. It
   was also evident that high value species at the beginning of the season
   were gradually replaced by low-value finfish as the season progresses.
   The results provide insights for new adaptive management strategies
   according to fisher's adaptive responses. For instance, using boats or
   fishing trips as fishing effort units in Yucatan may not be the most
   appropriated unit for management, as fishers adapt their strategies at
   different levels.},

Title = {Long-term temperature and sea-level rise stabilization before and beyond
   2100: Estimating the additional climate mitigation contribution from
   China's recent 2060 carbon neutrality pledge},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As the largest emitter in the world, China recently pledged to reach a
   carbon peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, which could
   accelerate the progress of mitigating negative climate change effects.
   In this study, we used the Minimum Complexity Earth Simulator and a
   semi-empirical statistical model to quantify the global mean temperature
   and sea-level rise (SLR) response under a suite of emission pathways
   that are constructed to cover various carbon peak and carbon neutrality
   years in China. The results show that China will require a carbon
   emission reduction rate of no less than 6\%/year and a growth rate of
   more than 10\%/year for carbon capture capacity to achieve carbon
   neutrality by 2060. Carbon peak years and peak emissions contribute
   significantly to mitigating climate change in the near term, while
   carbon neutrality years are more influential in the long term.
   Mitigation due to recent China's pledge alone will contribute a 0.16
   degrees C-0.21 degrees C avoided warming at 2100 and also lessen the
   cumulative warming above 1.5 degrees C level. When accompanied by
   coordinated international efforts to reach global carbon neutrality
   before 2070, the 2 degrees C target can be achieved. However, the 1.5
   degrees C target requires additional efforts, such as global scale
   adoption of negative emission technology for CO2, as well as a deep cut
   in non-CO2 GHG emissions. Collectively, the efforts of adopting negative
   emission technolgy and curbing all greenhouse gas emissions will reduce
   global warming by 0.9 degrees C -1.2 degrees C at 2100, and also reduce
   SLR by 49-59 cm in 2200, compared to a baseline mitigation pathway
   already aiming at 2 degrees C. Our findings suggest that while China's
   ambitious carbon-neutral pledge contributes to Paris Agreement's
   targets, additional major efforts will be needed, such as reaching an
   earlier and lower CO2 emission peak, developing negative emission
   technology for CO2, and cutting other non-CO2 GHGs such as N2O, CH4,
   O-3, and HFCs.},

Title = {Inclusion of Asparagopsis armata in lactating dairy cows' diet reduces
   enteric methane emission by over 50 percent},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {234},
Pages = {132-138},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Livestock production, particularly enteric methane production,
   contributes to greenhouse gas emissions globally. Various mitigation
   strategies developed to reduce enteric emissions have limited success.
   Although in vitro studies have shown a considerable reduction in methane
   emissions using Asparagopsis spp., no studies have been conducted to
   investigate the effect of any species of Asparagopsis in dairy cattle.
   Our objective was to evaluate quantitatively the response of cows
   consuming Asparagopsis armata on methane production (g/kg), yield (g/kg
   feed intake) and intensity (g/kg milk yield). Twelve post-peak lactating
   Holstein cows were randomly assigned to three treatments (control, 0.5\%
   and 1\% inclusion levels of A. armata on organic matter basis) in a 3 x
   3 Latin square design with three 21-day periods. Enteric methane
   emissions were measured using the GreenFeed system. Methane production
   by cows decreased significantly by 26.4\% at the low (0.5\%) level of A.
   armata inclusion and 67.2\% at the high (1\%) level of inclusion. Feed
   intake was reduced by 10.8 and 38.0\%, in cows fed the low and high
   level of macroalgae inclusion, respectively. Methane yield decreased
   significantly by 20.3 and 42.7\% in cows fed diet including 0.5\% and
   1\% A. armata inclusion levels, respectively (P = <0.0001). Methane
   intensity significantly decreased by 26.8\% from cows fed at 0.5\% level
   and 60\% at the 1.0\% A. armata inclusion level. Bromoform
   concentrations in milk were not significantly different between
   treatments. Our in vivo results showed that A. armata has potential to
   be used as a feed additive to reduce enteric methane emissions. (C) 2019

Title = {Comprehensive analysis of the air quality impacts of switching a marine
   vessel from diesel fuel to natural gas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {266},
Number = {3},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {New environmental regulations are mandating cleaner fuels and lower
   emissions from all maritime operations. Natural gas (NG) is a fuel that
   enables mariners to meet regulations; however, emissions data from
   maritime operations with natural gas is limited. We measured emissions
   of criteria, toxic and greenhouse pollutants from a dual-fuel marine
   engine running either on diesel fuel or NG as well as engine activity
   and analyzed the impacts on pollutants, health, and climate change.
   Results showed that particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), nitric
   oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were reduced by about 93\%, 97\%,
   92\%, and 18\%, respectively when switching from diesel to NG.
   Reductions of this magnitude provide a valuable tool for the many port
   communities struggling with meeting air quality standards. While these
   pollutants were reduced, formaldehyde (HCHO), carbon monoxide (CO) and
   methane (CH4) increased several-fold. A health risk assessment of
   exhaust plume focused on when the vessel was stationary, and at-berth
   showed the diesel plume increased long-term health risk and the NG plume
   increased short-term health risk. An analysis of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   and BC was performed and revealed that, on a hundred year basis, the
   whole fuel cycle global warming potential (GWP) per kWh including
   well-to-tank and exhaust was 50\% to few times higher than that of
   diesel at lower engine loads, but that it was similar at 75\% load and
   lower at higher loads. Mitigation strategies for further reducing
   pollutants from NG exhaust are discussed and showed potential for
   reducing short-term health risks and climate impacts. (C) 2020 Published

Abstract = {The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that global warming is ``unequivocal{''}
   and that most of the observed increase since the mid-twentieth century
   is very likely due to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   concentrations, with discernible human influences on ocean warming,
   continental-average temperatures, temperature extremes, wind patterns,
   and other physical and biological indicators, impacting both
   socioeconomic and ecological systems. It is now clear that we are
   committed to some level of global climate change, and it is imperative
   that this be considered when planning future climate research and
   observational strategies. The Global Climate Observing System program
   (GCOS), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and the
   International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) therefore initiated a
   process to summarize the lessons learned through AR4 Working Groups I
   and II and to identify a set of high-priority modeling and observational
   needs. Two classes of recommendations emerged. First is the need to
   improve climate models, observational and climate monitoring systems,
   and our understanding of key processes. Second, the framework for
   climate research and observations must be extended to document impacts
   and to guide adaptation and mitigation efforts. Research and
   observational strategies specifically aimed at improving our ability to
   predict and understand impacts, adaptive capacity, and societal and
   ecosystem vulnerabilities will serve both purposes and are the subject
   of the specific recommendations made in this paper.},

Abstract = {Coastal cities are under rising pressure to adapt to climate change.
   They suffer from the severe effects of increased frequencies and
   intensities of coastal hazards, particularly flooding, while oftentimes
   continuing to sprawl into hazard-exposed areas and grow beyond the pace
   of sufficient infrastructure development. Even though these problems
   have been quite well understood for a while, there is still
   comparatively little knowledge and scientific assessment of the solution
   space, i.e., on the options available for adaptation and the ways in
   which they are being perceived, framed and evaluated in the scientific
   literature. Focusing on Jakarta, this study presents findings from a
   systematic assessment of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the
   adaptation solution space with regard to current and future flooding.
   Jakarta is chosen as a case study since it is among the cities with the
   highest flood risk and adaptation pressure globally while also being one
   of the most heavily researched coastal cities in this regard, certainly
   in the Global South. Based on a structured keyword search, we assess 339
   articles. Results indicate that the perceived solution space is skewed
   towards hard protection against flooding, while measures to accommodate
   flooding or retreat from exposed areas are less widely considered in the
   scientific debate. Soft adaptation measures for the reduction of social
   vulnerability receive less attention in the literature than those
   measures targeting the taming of flood hazards, often through
   engineering solutions. Likewise, hybrid adaptation approaches, which
   combine soft and hard measures in a complementary way, are only rarely
   considered. Looking into the future, the findings suggest that despite
   the importance of hard flood protection as a main adaptation solution in
   Jakarta, other fields of the solution space deserve increased scientific
   attention. This relates in particular to urgently needed feasibility and
   effectiveness assessments of ecosystems-based solutions for flood
   mitigation and adaptation options targeting social vulnerability. While
   the empirical results are specific to Jakarta, heuristic observations
   from research on other coastal cities suggest that similar scoping
   exercises of the predominantly perceived solution space might be of
   relevance in many cities beyond Jakarta.},

Abstract = {Restoring degraded freshwater wetlands may help to maximize soil carbon
   sequestration. In this study, we use 18 Pb-210-dated sediment cores to
   determine the organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates from two
   hydrologically restored freshwater coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS)
   wetlands. Recent OC accumulation rates (from similar to 1980 to present)
   were estimated to be 251 +/- 26 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the seasonally
   inundated CASS and 227 +/- 50 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the permanently
   inundated CASS. The average OC accumulation during the previous century
   (190 +/- 20 g.m(-2).year(-1)) was within the range of blue carbon
   ecosystems (saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrasses). Considering their
   large area and carbon accumulation rate, we estimate that Australian
   CASS wetlands sequester approximately 7.8 +/- 0.8 Tg of carbon annually,
   which is equivalent to similar to 8\% of the CO2 emission from fossil
   fuels in Australia. Hence, preserving or restoring CASS may be a good
   climate change mitigation strategy.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal freshwater wetlands are highly productive
   and can sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon accumulation rates
   here suggest that coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) are also a
   substantial sink of CO2. By extrapolating our observations, we show that
   approximately 7.79 Tg of carbon is sequestered in Australian CASS
   wetlands annually which is equivalent to similar to 8\% of the CO2
   emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, managing CASS wetlands
   to protect their soil carbon store function may help offset
   anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gasses and their hydrological
   remediation could be an important component to the global carbon cycle.},

Abstract = {Facing the increasingly adverse impacts of climate change, many coastal
   cities in developing and least-developed countries have shaped their
   climate adaptation plan. This study aims to unpack the state-of-the-art
   municipal adaptation planning in developing countries. The paper seeks
   to understand the types of vulnerability and explore planned adaptation
   options through a content analysis of adaptation planning documents in
   45 selected coastal cities in developing countries. The result shows the
   complexity of vulnerabilities that are not only climate change impacts,
   but more importantly, the socio-economic sensitivity, the insufficient
   infrastructure system, and limited adaptive capacity. Adaptation
   responses, correspondingly, address primarily current vulnerabilities
   rather than future climate change impacts. Local climate change
   adaptation in developing countries, therefore, cannot separate from
   socio-economic development and capacity enhancement. A coordination
   mechanism for inter-policy is necessary to manage the trade-offs between
   multiple priorities.},

Abstract = {The likelihood of major changes in the global climate, caused by
   continuing emissions of greenhouse gases has led to numerous proposals
   for reductions in emissions, with the Kyoto Protocol being only a small
   and incomplete step. As well as the usual problems associated with
   decision-making under uncertainty, measures for mitigation of global
   warming involve a cascade of long time-scales associated with energy
   investments, carbon-cycle response and climate response.
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   Figure 1 illustrates some of the long time-scales involved. The bands
   represent the temperature given emissions that go to zero after the
   respective cutoff times. One feature is that even if emissions go to
   zero, temperatures continue to increase for some time. This effect is
   termed `committed warming'. It occurs because even though CO(2) starts
   to decline after emissions cease, the ocean has not come to equilibrium.
   In analysing such a situation, modelling activities have to include
   actions such as calibration, data assimilation and sensitivity analysis.
   Automatic differentiation provides an important tool for trans-forming
   computer models into a modelling system capable of performing these
   various tasks.
   In analysing such a situation, modelling activities have to include
   actions such as calibration, data assimilation and sensitivity analysis.
   Automatic differentiation provides an important tool for trans-forming
   computer models into a modelling system capable of performing these
   various tasks.
   This talk describes the use of automatic differentiation based on C++
   classes and operator overloading. This allows derivatives to be
   calculated with minimal changes to the underlying model.
   One important class of sensitivity analysis is associated with the
   so-called Brazilian Proposal. This was introduced during the
   negotiations leading to the Kyoto Protocol and envisages targets for
   emission reductions being set on the basis of nations' relative
   responsibility for global warming. A differential formalism is one of
   the approaches that has been considered for attribution of non-linear
   effects. Examples are presented.
   Higher-order derivatives can then be used to determine the extent to
   which such differential responsibilities are sensitive to uncertainties
   in the representation of global change.},

Title = {Increasing potential of biomass burning over Sumatra, Indonesia induced
   by anthropogenic tropical warming},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Uncontrolled biomass burning in Indonesia during drought periods damages
   the landscape, degrades regional air quality, and acts as a
   disproportionately large source of greenhouse gas emissions. The
   expansion of forest fires is mostly observed in October in Sumatra
   favored by persistent droughts during the dry season from June to
   November. The contribution of anthropogenic warming to the probability
   of severe droughts is not yet clear. Here, we show evidence that past
   events in Sumatra were exacerbated by anthropogenic warming and that
   they will become more frequent under a future emissions scenario. By
   conducting two sets of atmospheric general circulation model ensemble
   experiments driven by observed sea surface temperature for 1960-2011,
   one with and one without an anthropogenic warming component, we found
   that a recent weakening of the Walker circulation associated with
   tropical ocean warming increased the probability of severe droughts in
   Sumatra, despite increasing tropical-mean precipitation. A future
   increase in the frequency of droughts is then suggested from our
   analyses of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 model
   ensembles. Increasing precipitation to the north of the equator
   accompanies drier conditions over Indonesia, amplified by enhanced ocean
   surface warming in the central equatorial Pacific. The resultant
   precipitation decrease leads to a similar to 25\% increase in severe
   drought events from 1951-2000 to 2001-2050. Our results therefore
   indicate the global warming impact to a potential of wide-spreading
   forest fires over Indonesia, which requires mitigation policy for
   disaster prevention.},

Title = {Cost-benefit analysis of adaptation to storm surge due to climate change
   in Osaka Bay, Japan},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Abstract = {Climate change poses significant challenges and impacts to coastal
   communities. In order to limit future coastal flood risk, adaptation is
   necessary. This study presents an integrated model to simulate storm
   surge inundation risk in Osaka Bay under climate change and provide a
   cost-benefit analysis of structure adaptation strategies to reduce risk.
   The results show that storm surge inundation risk will increase
   dramatically as combined impacts of sea level rise and intensified storm
   surges due to global warming. Without adaptation measures, the expected
   annual damage cost increases from 9.85 billion JPY to 69.17 billion JPY
   in Osaka Bay under the projected RCP8.5 scenario to 2100. We then
   explore the effectiveness of structural adaptation strategies. The
   results indicate that raising the height of existing dikes can reduce
   inundation risk effectively. The benefits and costs depend on the
   elevated height and the discount rate. Using cost-benefit analysis, we
   find that upgrading by 1 m the height of existing dikes is the most
   cost-effective strategy for Osaka Bay. The methodology developed in this
   paper provides a reference for Osaka Bay and other coastal regions when
   they make coastal flood risk management and adaptation strategies to
   respond to climate change.},

Title = {Does Previous Experience of Floods Stimulate the Adoption of Coping
   Strategies? Evidence from Cross Sectional Surveys in Nigeria and

Abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, hydro-meteorological related disasters, such as
   floods, account for the majority of the total number of natural
   disasters. Over the past century, floods have affected 38 million
   people, claimed several lives and caused substantial economic losses in
   the region. The goal of this paper is to examine how personality
   disposition, social network, and socio-demographic factors mitigate the
   complex relationship between stressful life experiences of floods and
   ocean surges and the adoption of coping strategies among coastal
   communities in Nigeria and Tanzania. Generalized linear models (GLM)
   were fitted to cross-sectional survey data on 1003 and 1253 individuals
   in three contiguous coastal areas in Nigeria and Tanzania, respectively.
   Marked differences in the type of coping strategies were observed across
   the two countries. In Tanzania, the zero-order relationships between
   adoption of coping strategies and age, employment and income disappeared
   at the multivariate level. Only experience of floods in the past year
   and social network resources were significant predictors of
   participants' adoption of coping strategies, unlike in Nigeria, where a
   plethora of factors such as experience of ocean surges in the past one
   year, personality disposition, age, education, experience of flood in
   the past one year, ethnicity, income, housing quality and employment
   status were still statistically significant at the multivariate level.
   Our findings suggest that influence of previous experience on adoption
   of coping strategies is spatially ubiquitous. Consequently,
   context-specific policies aimed at encouraging the adoption of
   flood-related coping strategies in vulnerable locations should be
   designed based on local needs and orientation.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation policy and practice: The role of agents,
   institutions and systems},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Surrey, British Columbia, stands out in its efforts to go beyond the
   provincial mandate on climate change mitigation and incorporate
   adaptation into strategic planning. The community is not currently
   overwhelmed by climate change impacts, and has local agents and
   institutions in place to facilitate anticipatory climate adaptation
   planning. However, as seen with many other coastal communities,
   implementation of adaptation action is lagging in practice. Framed
   through the lens of resilience theory, this research investigates
   climate change threats and the dynamic relationship between local scale
   adaptation policy development, integration and implementation in
   practice. With Surrey as a case study, this research examines key actor
   narratives and strategic planning documents in order to understand how
   the community acts on climate change adaptation while being mandated to
   address mitigation. Findings suggests that while resilience building
   agents (e.g. senior management, elected officials) can spearhead and
   organize climate action, their ability to implement goals and policies
   in practice is largely determined by the robustness of institutions
   (e.g. strategic plans, policies) and systems (e.g. infrastructure,
   ecosystems). This case may provide decision-makers in other communities
   coping with similar climate threats with insight into the factors that
   can enable and challenge local adaptation planning processes.},

Volume = {22},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Small, low-lying islands are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate
   change and development of effective adaptation strategies is regarded as
   an urgent need. Through an analysis of existing and emerging climate
   adaptation policies, this paper assesses the climate adaptation response
   in the Cayman Islands. Despite its strong economic status and several
   developments in the areas of Planning, Environment and Tourism,
   alongside a draft Climate Change Policy, the study reveals a focus on
   symbolic policies and a lack of adopted ``concrete{''} climate change
   adaptation policies. Although the draft National Climate Change Policy
   (2011) contains a comprehensive range of substantial policies, none has
   been formally adopted by the Cayman Islands Government. The practical
   implications of this situation in the face of climate change-related
   hazards are assessed in the context of Seven Mile Beach, the most
   heavily developed stretch of the Cayman Islands coast. Here, the
   prevailing response to shoreline change is stabilisation and, despite
   several opportunities to change the situation, recent policy
   developments have not stimulated changes in practice.},

Title = {Future impact of cloudiness and wind changes on thermal comfort
   conditions in the city of Tabriz (Iran) in the frame of climate change},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change will alter thermal comfort very differently depending on
   the future scenario selected. This research computes two bioclimatic
   indices: Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) and Universal
   Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI), in the area of Tabriz (Iran), considering
   an observational period (1960 to 2020) and three projected scenarios
   (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) associated to greenhouse gas concentrations
   for the period 2030 to 2059 and 2060 to 2100. The CanESM2 model was used
   to estimate projected data. Thermal comfort for these three periods are
   compared at daily basis attending to the sky conditions (clear and
   cloudy) and the presence or absence of wind. The study of the
   observational period shows that the cloud cover effect has increased PET
   and UTCI values by 0.82 and 0.51 degrees C, respectively. For the
   projected period, it has been found an increase in PET and UTCI values
   by 0.36 and 0.42 degrees C associated to the presence of clouds. On the
   other hand, a decrease in temperature of 10 degrees C for PET and 11.73
   degrees C for UTCI is found in the observational period when windy and
   calm days are compared. This cooling effect of the wind will decrease in
   the projected period where temperature reduction based on PET and UTCI
   values is estimated to be 4.5 and 8.4 degrees C for 2030-2059 and 2.5
   and 5.2 degrees C for 2060-2100 respectively. In conclusion, future
   changes in clouds and wind will clearly impact thermal comfort in the
   city of Tabriz in the future decades. Both the projected cloudy heating
   effect and the reduction of the potential of cooling of the wind, will
   have serious implications for heat-related diseases and different
   socioeconomic activities in the region. Accordingly, the definition of
   mitigation and adaptation strategies in short term should be a priority.},

Title = {Disclosing biome sensitivity to atmospheric changes: Stable C isotope
   ecophysiological dependences during photosynthetic CO2 uptake in
   Maritime pine and Scots pine ecosystems from southwestern Europe},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY \& INNOVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Pages = {52-61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: The late XX century showed a sharp atmospheric
   delta(CO2)-C-13 decline mainly ascribed to increased emissions of
   greenhouse gases (GHG) resulting from fossil fuel combustion. Thus, in
   the current global-warming scenario, a deep knowledge of
   biosphere-atmosphere interactions became especially relevant to adopt
   appropriate guidelines for climate change management.
   Objective: Although tree-rings can attest long-term atmospheric
   composition trends, C isotopic variability among individual trees often
   disturbs the accurate interpretation of C-13 atmospheric changes from
   tree-rings at different timescales. Therefore, the aim of this research
   is to overcome this intertree variability by applying an isotopic
   approach that can practically absorb high-frequency climatic
   irregularities and genetic variabilities from dendrochronological
   series, hence allowing the accurate deconvolution of past atmospheric
   composition to improve current models.
   Methods: This research is based on original isotopic dendrochronological
   results obtained by performing tree-by-tree differential studies with
   intra-tree delta C-13 shifts to allow interspecies data standardization.
   Results: The isotopic composition of dendrochronological series
   collected from northwestern Spanish coniferous ecosystems clearly
   reflected the corresponding atmospheric C-13 changes but the stringency
   of the match also depended on some silvicultural parameters, tree-ring
   isotopic composition being able to exhibit either a magnification or
   attenuation of atmospheric changes according to specific metabolic
   differences that modulate photosynthetic C-13 discrimination in each
   ecological context.
   Conclusion: Relative isotopic changes revealed from our 25-year-long
   dendrological research, which properly mirrored the contemporary
   atmospheric (CO2)-C-13 composition (1978-2002), also showed the biome
   sensitivity to atmospheric changes, pointing towards a notable aptitude
   to respond to even incipient mitigation strategies and a significant
   resilience capacity of the Earth system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   offshore wind, in contrast to two advanced nuclear technologies,
   European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) and European Fast Reactor (EFR). The
   examination was made with regards to technology characteristics,
   sustainability factors and potential deployment drivers and barriers,
   obtained from relative studies. The analysis indicated that the examined
   RES and nuclear technologies both offer substantial contribution to
   climate change by effectively producing limited amounts of GHG
   emissions, which are close to zero for the nuclear technologies. The RES
   produce no significant waste and are generally favored by policy
   incentives, but some of them are plagued by high production costs and
   low efficiency. On the contrary, the examined nuclear technologies,
   despite their enhanced safety, reduced costs and minimized waste, still
   have to face the major issues of weapons proliferation, safety, waste
   handling and high costs as well as public acceptance, which have been
   affected by the recent Fukushima accident. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Although the timing and magnitude of global climate change is in
   dispute, the possible effects of such change merit consideration to
   allow for discussion of policy ramifications and mitigative actions.
   Climate change may result in sea level rise; water temperature increase;
   and deviations from present patterns of precipitation, wind, and water
   circulation.  Estuaries may experience loss of marsh habitat, intrusion
   of marine waters and associated organisms, changes in circulation
   patterns that affect retention of some indigenous species, and increased
   hypoxia and storm surges.  Estuarine and coastal systems could
   experience poleward retreat of cold-tolerant species and range expansion
   of warm-tolerant species.  Some fisheries and aquacultural enterprises
   and communities would benefit from the results of climate change and
   other would suffer losses, with economic and population dislocations
   probably inevitable in many parts of the world.  Thus, flexibility in
   policy-making and planning will be vital if global climate is modified
   as rapidly as is anticipated by some scientists.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {676-694},
Abstract = {China's water transport sector has experienced a rapid growth over
   recent years. In this study, we estimated the CO2 emissions from China's
   inland waterway, coastal and ocean freight shipping for the period of
   2006 to 2012. In order to make sure that existing data can be
   effectively utilised and data uncertainty can be addressed, we employed
   three approaches to estimate CO2 emissions, including freight turnover
   volume-based approach, engine operation-based approach, and vessel
   activity-based approach, respectively. Research outcomes show that CO2
   emissions from China's freight shipping increased from 58.7 mt (million
   ton) in 2006 to 83.5 mt in 2012, with an annual growth rate of 6.1\%.
   Currently, CO2 emissions from freight shipping accounted for around 12\%
   of CO2 emissions from transport sector and 1\% of the overall CO2
   emissions in China. From the subsector perspective, ocean freight
   shipping contributed the most to the total CO2 emissions, with a
   percentage of 48.2\% in 2012. However, CO2 emissions from inland
   waterway and coastal freight shipping had higher growth rates and their
   shares might increase considerably in the long-term. Based upon our
   research findings, we propose our policy suggestions on mitigating CO2
   emissions from freight shipping, with a special focus on ocean freight
   shipping.},

Title = {Can Strategies to Cope with Hazard Shocks be Explained by At-Risk
   Households' Socioeconomic Asset Profile? Evidence from Tropical
   Cyclone-Prone Coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-63},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article documents the results of an empirical investigation on the
   complex interplay between diverse coping mechanisms and the
   socioeconomic asset profiles of coastal households at risk. Focusing on
   household-level perceptions and responses to cyclone hazards, a case
   study was carried out in a poor area in Bangladesh that is prone to
   natural hazards. We developed and tested our own analytical models based
   on the asset approach. We conducted a face-to-face household survey in
   southwestern coastal Bangladesh, in the Koyra sub-district, in late
   2009. We asked 360 households affected by the May 2009 tropical Cyclone
   Aila about their hazard perceptions, preparedness, coping practices, and
   socioeconomic assets. The results suggest that the majority of
   households at risk perceive an increasing trend of different climate
   hazards, with a distinct dominance of tropical cyclones, storm surges,
   and flash floods in the study area, which resulted in a yearly average
   economic damage of USD 144 for each household in the first year after
   Aila. However, such damage is significantly and inversely correlated
   with the number of adopted coping practices. Significant and systematic
   differences exist between upstream and downstream households in the
   study area with respect to hazard perception, hazard induced damages,
   asset accessibility, and adopted diversified coping practices. The
   empirical findings suggest that the degree of adoption of coping
   practices depends primarily on elements of socioeconomic asset profile
   and the duration of the consequences of cyclone hazards. Disaster
   preparedness training seems to improve at-risk households' degree of
   information access and eventually leads them to adopt more coping
   practices to reduce adverse impacts of climate hazards. Area-specific
   practical modules on coping practices should be incorporated in
   curricula of disaster preparedness training to make people at risk more
   resilient to hazard shocks.},

   Solar Power Symbiosis in Taiwan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Renewable energy development is a key pathway for mitigating climate
   change. The Taiwan government has been actively developing low carbon
   green energy with solar photovoltaic technology and wind power as their
   primary development projects. Cigu Taiwan provides an ideal research
   site to examine tradeoffs between ecological conservation, marine
   fisheries, and green power development, and the factors affect
   commitments to ecological conservation in the face of these tradeoffs.
   This research investigates the fishery and electricity symbiosis project
   in Cigu through a novel combination of the theory of planned behavior
   and the contingent valuation method to analyze the factors influencing
   the local residents' behavioral intentions to safeguard ecological
   achievements in ecologically fragile areas through conservation trust
   funds. Analysis of survey responses from a convenience sample of 715
   residents and resource users in the Cigu area reports that attitudes
   (ATT), subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC),
   environmental concern (EC), and environmental risk (ER) significantly
   influence the behavioral intention to pay eco-compensation fees; the
   local residents' willingness to pay for the conservation trust funds was
   NTD 621.4/year (USD 21.9/year), and decreased to NTD 545.9/year (USD
   19.2/year) after the implementation of fishery and electricity
   symbiosis. The discussion section argues that the drivers of ATT, SN,
   PBC, EC, and ER can be used by policy makers to direct local residents'
   intentions and behavior toward conserving ecological achievements in
   fragile eco-environmental areas through payments for ecosystem services.
   Thus, this strategy can improve the sustainability of ecological and
   environmental restoration programs.},

Abstract = {Los Angeles (LA) County's coastal areas are highly valued for their
   natural benefits and their economic contributions to the region. While
   LA County already has a high level of exposure to flooding (e.g. people,
   ports, and harbors), climate change and sea level rise will increase
   flood risk; anticipating this risk requires adaptation planning to
   mitigate social, economic, and physical damage. This study provides an
   overview of the potential effects of sea level rise on coastal LA County
   and describes adaptation pathways and estimates associated costs in
   order to cope with sea level rise. An adaptation pathway in this study
   is defined as the collection of measures (e.g., beach nourishment, dune
   restoration, flood-proofing buildings, and levees) required to lower
   flood risk. The aim of using different adaptation pathways is to enable
   a transition from one methodology to another over time. These pathways
   address uncertainty in future projections, allowing for flexibility
   among policies and potentially spreading the costs over time.
   Maintaining beaches, dunes, and their natural dynamics is the foundation
   of each of the three adaptation pathways, which address the importance
   of beaches for recreation, environmental value, and flood protection. In
   some scenarios, owing to high projections of sea level rise, additional
   technical engineering options such as levees and sluices may be needed
   to reduce flood risk. The research suggests three adaptation pathways,
   anticipating a +1 ft (0.3 m) to +7 ft (+2 m) sea level rise by year
   2100. Total adaptation costs vary between \$4.3 and \$6.4 bn, depending
   on measures included in the adaptation pathway.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change constitutes a main challenge for the Wadden
   Sea. Accelerated sea level rise, increasing temperatures and changing
   wind climate may strongly alter present structures and functions of the
   ecosystem with negative consequences both for nature conservation and
   for coastal risk management. Being aware of these challenges,
   Schleswig-Holstein State Government decided to establish an integrated
   climate change adaptation strategy for the Schleswig-Holstein sector of
   the Wadden Sea. The strategy was adopted in June 2015. It aims at the
   long-term maintenance of present functions and structures as well as the
   integrity of the Wadden Sea ecosystem in a changing climate. The
   strategy was prepared by a project group consisting of representatives
   from State authorities as well as from nature conservation organisations
   and local institutions. First outcome of the strategy is that extra
   adaptation measures will not be necessary in the coming decades.
   However, pending on the future rate of sea level rise, shoreline erosion
   and sediment deficits in the Wadden Sea will increase and sooner or
   later drowning of tidal flats and terrestrial habitats like beaches,
   primary dunes and salt marshes will start. At the time when management
   measures to counteract the negative developments become expedient from a
   nature conservation viewpoint as well as for coastal risk management,
   adequate actions with minimized ecological interferences are possible.
   It is assumed that balancing the sediment deficits as the main
   adaptation measure may be implemented most efficiently by concentrating
   sediment suppletion at locations where natural forces organize
   redistribution in the Wadden Sea. Local technical coastal risk
   management measures like the strengthening of sea defences will,
   nevertheless, remain necessary as well.},

Abstract = {A systemic approach on the elaboration of adaptation policy systems was
   begun in 2008 by the approval of the Report on Adaptation to Climate
   Change by the Latvian Government and a new task was put forward - to
   elaborate national strategy on adaptation. Several examples of sectoral
   adaptation policies and measures are already being implemented in Latvia
   (flood risk assessment and management, risk management and insurance in
   agriculture, coastal zone management, etc.) and research is being
   conducted on climate change impacts. A systemic approach is required for
   decision-making to solve such a huge, global, and unstructured problem
   as climate change impacts and risks. This involves facilitating work of
   different partners and stakeholders involved in decision-making to reach
   a common basis for efficient action, normative principles, and
   appropriate criteria (sustainability, and others subordinated to it -
   precautionary measures, solidarity and cooperation, dematerialization,
   sustainable resource use, triple bottom line, diversification,
   ``polluter pays{''}). This paper analyses some key aspects integral to
   the development of a national system of adaptation to climate change,
   discusses practical considerations (policies and measures) already being
   implemented in Latvia, and proposes a new policy design approach for
   more efficient elaboration and implementation of adaptation policy.},

Abstract = {Coastal Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate change and
   salinisation; hence, farm-level adaptation is critically important.
   Farmers' perceptions of and responses to environmental change were
   investigated in two villages in Khulna District. Perceived environmental
   trends included increases in temperature, extreme weather events, soil
   toxicity, erratic rainfall and scarcity of water for irrigation.
   Perceptions of climate trends were consistent with measured trends in
   Khulna. On-farm adaptation strategies included adjusting planting dates,
   excavating trenches in rice-fields, adopting new crops,
   salinity-reducing technologies, livestock-rearing and home-yard
   cropping. Non-farm adaptation strategies included wage employment,
   short-term migration and self-employment. Adaptation was facilitated by
   income-earning opportunities, training, and credit, and impeded by lack
   of access to water, markets, capital, and extension services. Farmers
   suggested policy support for dissemination of stress-tolerant cultivars,
   access to irrigation, and price stabilisation or crop insurance to
   assist adaptation. While the study shows an impressive degree of
   awareness and adaptation, external support is needed to increase
   adaptive capacity.},

Abstract = {The progressively emerging concept of urban resilience to climate change
   highlights the importance of mitigation and adaptation measures, and the
   need to integrate urban climatology in the design process, in order to

   comfortable urban open spaces. This study focuses the attention on
   selected mitigation and adaptation technologies; two renovation
   scenarios were designed and modeled according to the minimal
   intervention criterion. The study pays attention to the effect on
   surface temperature and physiological equivalent temperature (PET) of
   vegetation and high albedo materials characterizing the horizontal
   boundaries of the site. The Sapienza University campus, a historical
   site in Rome, is taken as a case study. These results highlight the
   importance of treed open spaces and the combination of permeable green
   pavements associated with cool roofs as the most effective strategy for
   the mitigation of summer heatwaves and the improvement of outdoor

Title = {Climbing the mountain fast but smart: Modelling rubber tree growth and
   latex yield under climate change},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {439},
Pages = {55-69},

Abstract = {Para rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Mull. Arg) plantations have expanded
   into regions with sub-optimal growth conditions: distinct dry seasons
   and temperatures cooler than in humid tropics. The impact of these new
   marginal environments and future climate change on rubber tree
   development and latex yield is largely unknown. This hampers reliable
   prediction of farmers' revenues and extent of carbon sequestration at
   landscape level. To improve our understanding of rubber trees response
   to planting at high altitudes and associated increase in planting
   densities, we applied the process-based Land Use Change Impact
   Assessment tool (LUCIA). It was calibrated with detailed ground survey
   data from Xishuangbanna, southwest China to model tree biomass
   development and latex yield in rubber plantations at the tree, plot and
   landscape level. Plantations were analyzed at < 900 m above sea level
   (a.s.l., lowland rubber) and >= 900 m a.s.l. (highland rubber) in order
   to characterize the effect of elevation on rubber trees. Three planting
   densities: low (< 495 trees ha(-1)), medium (495-600 trees ha(-1)) and
   high (> 600 trees ha(-1)) were tested. Four greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios, with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) ranging from
   the lowest RCP 2.6 to the highest emission scenario RCP 8.5, were used
   to test rubber tree response to climate change. During a 40-year
   rotation under current climate, lowland rubber plantations grew faster
   and had larger latex yields than highland rubber. The average biomass of
   lowland rubber was 9\% and 18\% higher than those of highland rubber for
   aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively. High planting density
   rubber plantations showed 5\% and 4\% higher above ground biomass than
   those at low- and medium-planting density, but simulations suggest that
   the cumulative latex production decreased strongly by 26\% and 14\%
   respectively. The results of the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario
   suggested that during 40 years simulation mean total biomass and
   cumulative latex yield of highland rubber (per tree) increased by 28\%
   and 48\%, while lowland rubber increased by 8\% and 10\% respectively
   when compared to the baseline. Other rubber cultivation regions could
   also benefit from this modelling approach that helps in optimization of
   carbon stock and latex production in rubber-based system. The results
   could help in development of future climate change adaption and
   mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Review on CH4-CO2 replacement for CO2 sequestration and CH4/CO2 hydrate
   formation in porous media},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {320},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Adverse effects of excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere emanating
   from fossil fuels have prompted intense research on clean energy sources
   as replacements and carbon capture. Research on natural gas hydrate has
   intensified in the past century due to the occurrence of natural gas
   hydrate in numerous places around the world on the sea beds and in
   permafrost regions. Due to its energy value and ability to form a
   clathrate hydrate with water, the methane molecule has proven to be
   useful as both a viable energy store and a means of carbon dioxide
   sequestration in natural gas hydrates. Methane can be produced from
   natural gas hydrates while controlling carbon dioxide emission, by
   replacing methane molecules with carbon dioxide from its crystalline
   structure. This review focuses on the encapsulation of carbon dioxide by
   a replacement reaction of methane from natural gas hydrates, with
   methane-carbon dioxide replacement models presented and discussed.
   Experimental variables affecting the CH4-CO2 replacement process along
   with reported theoretical findings were reviewed. These are discussed
   along with the challenges and limitations in the replacement process. In
   addition, the fundamentals of hydrate formation mechanisms on porous
   media are detailed. Finally, an extensive discussion and comparison of
   the experimental studies of hydrate formation involving various porous
   media materials such as activated carbon, glass beads, solid and hollow
   silica in the presence of chemical additives and nanoparticles, with
   carbon dioxide and methane gas molecules are presented. Synopsis:
   Climate change mitigation strategies in minimising CO2 emissions while
   harnessing energy by replacing methane with CO2 from the hydrate
   structure.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies and community participation in government-led
   mitigation projects: A comparison between urban and suburban communities
   in Pekalongan, Indonesia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {81},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Governments often take a top-down approach in their mitigation projects
   to deal with the risks of climate change in coastal areas. However,
   community participation may increase the effectiveness of a mitigation
   project. Places whose community has a different nature of place/social
   attachment can have a different community likelihood of participating in
   social activities, particularly its community-led adaptation strategies
   and involvement in government-led mitigation projects. Therefore, this
   research article explores the differences between how an urban community
   and a suburban community implement adaptation strategies and participate
   in government-led mitigation projects. We conducted a questionnaire
   survey to collect data from 100 urban and 100 suburban residents. The
   results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and corroborated by
   five key informants. The results indicate that the suburban community
   was more likely to implement community-led adaptation strategies due to
   its willingness to participate in social activities. The suburban
   community also had more significant participation in government-led
   mitigation projects and then positively affected the outcomes of the
   projects. Other factors like the role of villages' heads and the
   existence of facilitators also influenced the local community to
   participate in the projects. This study suggests that more significant
   community participation might increase the sense of belonging of the
   local community in government-led mitigation projects. Therefore, the
   local community would have a stronger willingness to maintain and
   contribute to the sustainability of the projects' results.},

Abstract = {In a carbon constrained environment, the ongoing utilisation of
   southeastern Australia's extensive brown coal reserves, largely
   contained within Victoria's Latrobe Valley, will require substantial
   mitigation of the related greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon Dioxide
   Capture and (geological) Storage (CCS) has been selected as a potential
   emissions mitigation technology for this region. Three basins were
   short-listed as potential injection sites within Victoria: the Gippsland
   Basin (both onshore and offshore); the offshore Bass Basin; and the
   offshore Torquay Sub-Basin. These sites were taken through a provisional
   subsurface engineering evaluation, which allowed an evaluation of the
   likely viability of large-scale CO2 storage within the three basins, the
   security of CO2 containment, achievable injectivity and capacity. The
   work presented here was premised on CO2 injection commencing in 2015, at
   an initial injection rate of 5 MT annually, increasing to 20 MT annually
   by 2020. The southern flank of the Gippsland Basin (offshore) ranks
   highest in terms of estimated accessiblity and storage capacity, with
   over 700 MT of CO2 storage available, characterised by saline aquifer
   trapping. The storage capacity of the Bass Basin is estimated to be over
   400 MT, available within structural traps. The onshore Gippsland Basin
   and the Torquay Sub-Basin are ranked as the least suitable for the
   long-term storage of CO2, due to uncertainties associated with
   injectivity and containment, together with relatively small estimated
   storage capacities (<100 MT). The current study illustrates that
   significant potential for storage exists in both Victoria's offshore
   Gippsland Basin and the Bass Basin. Although indicative costs are large
   the region provides an ideal platform from which large-scale CO2 storage
   projects of global importance may be undertaken. (C) 2011 Published by

Title = {Biomass burning, humans and climate change in Southeast Asia},

Abstract = {Biomass burning is an integral part of the Earth system, influencing and
   being influenced by global climate conditions, vegetation cover and
   human activity. Fire has long been associated with certain vegetation
   types and land uses in Southeast Asia, but has increasingly affected
   forests in Indonesia over the last 50 years or so, and peat swamp
   forests in particular during the last two to three decades. The role of
   humans, as igniters of fires and as contributors to the conditions that
   enable fires once ignited to spread widely, is discussed. Other factors,
   notably the involvement of anomalous climate conditions linked to
   variability in the Indian and Pacific oceans, are also considered.
   Global warming and changes in landuse could result in biomass burning
   becoming more frequent in the future, threatening biodiversity and human
   health and leading to positive feedbacks with climate change. Deliberate
   action is required to break a developing disequilibrium within the Earth
   system: incentives currently being considered under the UN Framework
   Convention on Climate Change aimed at curbing climate change-causing
   emissions from deforestation and forest degradation could help mitigate
   biomass burning, while the effective management of biochar, a stable
   form of carbon produced from the incomplete combustion of organic
   matter, by farmers in Southeast Asia, and in other regions where biomass
   burning is common, could help in carbon sequestration. The paper
   concludes by stressing that in order to be effective any action needs to
   recognise the full range of environmental and human factors underpinning
   biomass burning.},

Title = {Adaptation pathways to cope with salinization in south-west coastal
   region of Bangladesh},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Salinization in coastal regions of Bangladesh challenges sustainable
   development of different sectors like agriculture, forestry, fisheries,
   livestock, and health. Particularly its southwest region largely faces
   increased salinity risks because of its geographical location and
   environmental settings. This study analyzes the causes of salinity
   increase, their cascading impacts on different coastal systems, and
   their livelihood implications, and assesses potential coping measures
   through innovative adaptation pathways for the most affected coastal
   systems. These pathways integrate bottom-up and top-down perceptions in
   adaptation planning through a driver-pressure-state-impact-response
   framework, multicriteria analysis, and adaptation turning point
   approaches. We surveyed 200 households and interviewed 20 key
   informants. We observed that household-level respondents' perceptions
   are more closely related to socioeconomic aspects than to the
   biophysical environmental aspects and focus on issue-based action.
   However, the key informants focus more on the biophysical changes and
   the large-scale measures. The developed framework shows that salinity
   increase is an interconnected process of
   climatic-social-ecological-economic systems in the coastal environment.
   It also shows that responses already taken, i.e., polders and shrimp
   farming, to cope with salinization have later become pressures, i.e.,
   riverbed siltation, waterlogging, and intensive salinization, on the
   systems. In total, we identified six interconnected causes of salinity
   increase and 24 potential measures to address them. Also we
   distinguished three coastal systems, i.e., crop-agriculture, drinking
   water sources, and the Sundarbans mangrove, most affected by salinity
   increase. Finally we proposed 16 adaptation pathways for these coastal
   systems based on the multicriteria analysis and adaptation turning
   points of the potential measures.},

Title = {A micro-scale cost-benefit analysis of building-level flood risk
   adaptation measures in Los Angeles},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of flood risk adaptation strategies offers
   policymakers insight into economically optimal strategies for adapting
   to sea level rise. However, building-level adaptation measures such as
   floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated
   spatial scales, which may result in sub-optimal investment decisions. In
   this paper, we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a
   micro-scale CBA at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of
   adaptation measures per area. We apply this approach to Venice Beach in
   Los Angeles and Naples in Long Beach. We subsequently compare our
   results with the conventional, spatially aggregated area-based CBA
   approach. Our findings show that a mix of 35\%-45\% dry-flood proofing
   measures and 55\%-65\% building elevation measures is optimal. Elevation
   works best in areas with high inundation depths, while dry-floodproofing
   is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths. The optimal mix
   of measures derived from our micro-scale approach results in an economic
   efficiency up to 85\% higher than that yielded by the commonly applied
   spatially aggregated approach. We therefore recommend that economic
   evaluations of building-level adaptation measures are conducted at the
   smallest possible scale, or that CBAs are performed on disaggregated
   areas based on inundation depth.},

Title = {Make the Most of the Data You've Got: Bayesian Models and a Surrogate

   the Endangered Australian Grayling},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Environmental water managers must make best use of allocations, and
   adaptive management is one means of improving effectiveness of
   environmental water delivery. Adaptive management relies on generation
   of new knowledge from monitoring and evaluation, but it is often
   difficult to make clear inferences from available monitoring data.
   Alternative approaches to assessment of flow benefits may offer an
   improved pathway to adaptive management. We developed Bayesian
   statistical models to inform adaptive management of the threatened
   Australian grayling (Prototroctes maraena) in the coastal Thomson River,
   South-East Victoria Australia. The models assessed the importance of
   flows in spring and early summer (migration flows) for upstream
   dispersal and colonization of juveniles of this diadromous species.
   However, Australian grayling young-of-year were recorded in low numbers,
   and models provided no indication of the benefit of migration flows. To
   overcome this limitation, we applied the same models to young-of-year of
   a surrogate species (tupong-Pseudaphritis urvilli)-a more common
   diadromous species expected to respond to flow similarly to Australian
   grayling-and found strong positive responses to migration flows. Our
   results suggest two complementary approaches to supporting adaptive
   management of Australian grayling. First, refine monitoring approaches
   to allow direct measurement of effects of migration flows, a process
   currently under way. Second, while waiting for improved data, further
   investigate the use of tupong as a surrogate species. More generally,
   alternative approaches to assessment can improve knowledge to inform
   adaptive management, and this can occur while monitoring is being
   revised to directly target environmental responses of interest.},

Title = {Resilience, adaptation and expected support for food security among the
   Malaysian east coast poor households},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {877-902},
Abstract = {Purpose Sustainable food security at the household level is one of the
   emerging issues for all nations. It is expected that the patterns of
   household resilience factors and adaptation practices have a strong
   linkage with household food security. The purpose of this paper is to
   seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the
   required types of support for adaptation to food insecurity among the
   poor and low-income households in Malaysia.
   Design/methodology/approach This study was based on primary data that
   were collected in July-October 2012 through a questionnaire survey among
   460 poor and low-income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and
   Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih
   poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling
   technique. The study considered household food security as household
   food availability and food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to
   find out the linkages of household food security with household
   resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for
   adaptation to food security.
   Findings The study concludes that several resilience factors and
   adaptation practices were statistically significant to household food
   security, and several external supports were statistically and
   significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to
   ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food
   security programs need to be integrated with sustainable development
   goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation programs, and the
   involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial.
   Originality/value This study is a pioneer work based on primary data
   that empirically measured the linkages of household food security with
   household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support
   for adaptation to food security in Malaysia. This study also discussed
   some issues related to the climate change linkage, which would help
   future climate change research. The findings of the study will be
   beneficial for all the stakeholders, including policy makers related to
   the food security and climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Adaptation Pathways in Coastal Case Studies: Lessons Learned and Future
   Directions},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {384-405},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation presents a difficult challenge for coastal
   towns around the world, forcing local governments to plan for sea level
   rise in a contentious decision-making space. The concept of ``adaptation
   pathways,{''} a diagnostic and analytical tool to assist in adaptive
   planning and decision-making, is gaining traction as a way of framing
   and informing climate adaptation. It provides decisionmakers a way to
   acknowledge the inter-temporal complexities and uncertainties associated
   with the novel dynamics of climate change and a mechanism to manage
   these challenges in the local context. In 2012, the Australian
   Government funded an 18-month program to provide decisionmakers in the
   coastal zone an opportunity to test the utility of the adaptation
   pathways concept for coastal climate adaptation. Using a selection of
   completed projects as case studies, we performed a document analysis to
   better understand the learnings from the projects. The main themes
   surrounded: (1) the utility of the adaptation pathway framework in
   developing options, (2) decision-making rationale and criteria, and (3)
   stakeholder participation in pathway development. A project participant
   survey was developed to further understand these themes. Our analysis
   reveals that ``adaptation pathways{''} was generally framed narrowly and
   conservatively to emphasize extant economic, administrative and legal
   considerations over community, participatory, or exploratory ones.
   Although some case study projects were able to reach a point in the
   pathway discussion to actively involve stakeholders in their
   decision-making process, many case studies continued to build technical
   data as a method for defending policies and actions. These results
   indicate that coastal adaptation can take-up adaptation pathways as a
   useful concept for decision-making and planning; however, many councils
   may still require assistance in stakeholder communication processes in
   order to develop sociallyacceptable plans that take into account the
   full range of values affecting local coastal environments.},

Abstract = {Solar radiation management (SRM) could provide a fast and low-cost
   option to mitigate global warming, but can also incur unwanted or
   unexpected climatic side-effects. As these side-effects involve
   substantial uncertainties, the optimal role of SRM cannot be yet
   determined. Here, we present probabilistic emission scenarios that limit
   global mean temperature increase to 2 A degrees C under uncertainty on
   possible future SRM deployment. Three uncertainties relating to SRM
   deployment are covered: the start time, intensity and possible
   termination. We find that the uncertain SRM option allows very little
   additional GHG emissions before the SRM termination risk can be
   excluded, and the result proved robust over different hypothetical
   probability assumptions for SRM deployment. An additional CO2
   concentration constraint, e.g. to mitigate ocean acidification,
   necessitates CO2 reductions even with strong SRM; but in such case SRM
   renders non-CO2 reductions unnecessary. This illustrates how the framing
   of climatic targets and available mitigation measures affect strongly
   the optimal mitigation strategies. The ability of SRM to decrease
   emission reduction costs is diminished by the uncertainty in SRM
   deployment and the possible concentration constraint, and also depends
   heavily on the assumed emission reduction costs. By holding SRM
   deployment time uncertain, we also find that carrying out safeguard
   emission reductions and delaying SRM deployment by 10 to 20 years
   increases reduction costs only moderately.},

Abstract = {The observed and projected increase in emission of greenhouse gases,
   with attendant effects on global warming and sea level rise, have raised
   interests in identifying mitigation options. Terrestrial C sequestration
   involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in
   biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have
   a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. Losses of C
   from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation,
   biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture,
   and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C
   (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert
   carbon with long residence time. Practices that enhance C sequestration
   include afforestation and reforestation, conservation tillage and mulch
   farming, integrated nutrient management and adopting systems with high
   biodiversity. Net C sequestration within an ecosystem can be assessed by
   taking into account the hidden C costs of fertilizers, pesticides,
   tillage, irrigation and other input. Restoration of degraded soils and
   ecosystems has a vast potential of C sequestration. The Kyoto Protocol
   provides for C sequestration in terrestrial sinks and C trading through
   Clean Development Mechanisms. Terrestrial C sequestration, besides being
   a win-win strategy, offers a window of opportunity for the first few
   decades of the 21(st) century. It is a natural process of reducing the
   rates of gaseous emissions while alternatives to fossil fuel take
   effect.},

Title = {A review of methodologies applied in Australian practice to evaluate
   long-term coastal adaptation options},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {35-51},
Abstract = {Rising sea levels have the potential to alter coastal flooding regimes
   around the world and local governments are beginning to consider how to
   manage uncertain coastal change. In doing so, there is increasing
   recognition that such change is deeply uncertain and unable to be
   reliably described with probabilities or a small number of scenarios.
   Characteristics of methodologies applied in Australian practice to
   evaluate long-term coastal adaptation options are reviewed and
   benchmarked against two state-of-the-art international methods suited
   for conditions of uncertainty (Robust Decision Making and Dynamic
   Adaptive Policy Pathways). Seven out of the ten Australian case studies
   assumed the uncertain parameters, such as sea level rise, could be
   described deterministically or stochastically when identifying risk and
   evaluating adaptation options across multi-decadal periods. This basis
   is not considered sophisticated enough for long-term decision-making,
   implying that Australian practice needs to increase the use of scenarios
   to explore a much larger uncertainty space when assessing the
   performance of adaptation options. Two Australian case studies mapped
   flexible adaptation pathways to manage uncertainty, and there remains an
   opportunity to incorporate quantitative methodologies to support the
   identification of risk thresholds. The contextual framing of risk,
   including the approach taken to identify risk (top-down or bottom-up)
   and treatment of uncertain parameters, were found to be fundamental
   characteristics that influenced the methodology selected to evaluate
   adaptation options. The small sample of case studies available suggests
   that long-term coastal adaptation in Australian is in its infancy and
   there is a timely opportunity to guide local government towards robust
   methodologies for developing long-term coastal adaptation plans. (C)

   Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York:
   Cambridge University Press) paints a generally grim view of where the
   Earth is heading for by the end of the century if effective mitigation
   strategies are not implemented in the next few years. Mitigation
   measures of the type required to prevent major environmental damage in
   the future can only be effective if a global political approach based on
   agreed levels of climate change gas reduction is implemented. For its
   part the tourism industry is caught in a trap, unable to adopt
   meaningful mitigation strategies because of reluctance by consumers to
   bear the cost of changes that will be required but having to meet the
   cost of climate change mitigation and adaption strategies when they are
   introduced in the future. This article proposes a four stage problem
   definition and response framework with associated models that can be
   used by the industry to plan for and adapt to climate change both prior
   to and after the introduction of legislation and policies to combat
   climate change at the national and international levels.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of global environmental change, management strategies
   that can deal with unexpected change in resource dynamics are becoming
   increasingly important. In this paper we undertake a novel approach to
   studying resource growth problems using a computational form of adaptive
   management to find optimal strategies for prevalent natural resource
   management dilemmas. We scrutinize adaptive management, or
   learning-by-doing, to better understand how to simultaneously manage and
   learn about a system when its dynamics are unknown. We study important
   trade-offs in decision-making with respect to choosing optimal actions
   (harvest efforts) for sustainable management during change. This is
   operationalized through an artificially intelligent model where we
   analyze how different trends and fluctuations in growth rates of a
   renewable resource affect the performance of different management
   strategies. Our results show that the optimal strategy for managing
   resources with declining growth is capable of managing resources with
   fluctuating or increasing growth at a negligible cost, creating in a
   management strategy that is both efficient and robust towards future
   unknown changes. To obtain this strategy, adaptive management should
   strive for: high learning rates to new knowledge, high valuation of
   future outcomes and modest exploration around what is perceived as the
   optimal action.},

Abstract = {Flood and coastal erosion risk management has always faced the challenge
   of decision making in the face of multiple uncertainties relating to the
   climate, the economy and society. Traditionally, this has been addressed
   by adopting a precautionary approach that seeks to protect against a
   reasonable worst case. However, a managed adaptive approach can offer
   advantages. The benefits include improved resilience to negative
   changes, enabling opportunities from positive changes and greater cost
   effectiveness. The absence of clear methods and tools to value adaptive
   approaches has been recognised as an obstacle to wider adoption. This
   paper proposes a staged approach to building in adaptive capacity, which
   systematically analyses uncertainties, identifies opportunities to
   incorporate adaptability and appraises benefits through the analysis of
   decision trees. A case study is presented. The methodology is set in the
   context of appraisal processes used in England by the Environment
   Agency, based on cost-benefit analysis guidance issued by HM Treasury.
   The approach is transferable to other situations worldwide, where
   decision making is based on quantified assessment of costs and benefits.
   The work should help decision makers fully appraise the benefits of
   building in adaptive capacity and make the economic and technical case
   for adaptive flood risk management in an uncertain environment.},

Abstract = {The global water gap, water demand minus water supply, is expected to
   increase through 2100, negatively affecting agriculture, industry and

   adaptation evaluation framework aimed at closing the water gap, which is
   applied offline at the global scale, and made available for regional
   decision making as a web service. It includes climate change and
   socioeconomic scenarios over the 21st century as drivers for global
   projections of water supply and demand. The transient water gap was
   calculated for 1604 water provinces globally and we determined the water
   gap reduction that could be achieved by three increasingly involved sets
   of adaptation measures. The median annual adaptation costs amount to
   1.4-1.6\% of the GDP per affected water province. The interactive
   web-based simulation allows users to include information that is not
   available at the global scale.},

Abstract = {The Baltic Sea is located in northeastern Europe and is the largest
   brackish sea surrounded by nine countries: Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
   Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Sweden. Due to its
   fragile ecosystem, the Baltic Sea's vulnerability in climate change has
   been studied by several international organizations by multidisciplinary
   groups. With the release of the recommendation from the white paper by
   the European Union in April of 2009, the need for adaptation strategies
   is reaffirmed in the area and today consensus on the need for national
   adaptation policy has been built among Baltic Sea countries. This paper
   offers an overall assessment of adaptation strategies in the Baltic Sea
   Region and outlines the results of a comparative analysis of two
   countries, namely Latvia and Sweden. The two countries' advancements in
   terms of releasing official climate change adaptation strategies are
   presented, as well as the areas each of their policies or suggested
   policies cover. Finally, both countries are placed into context with
   Baltic Sea neighbours with similar socioeconomical characteristics to
   offer a more rounded view of the general situation in the region.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Shrimp aquaculture in India is synonymous with coastal aquaculture. Like
   other agricultural activities, it appropriates a wide range of
   environmental goods and services, and is vulnerable to impacts of
   climate change as the cultured animals are sensitive to various kinds of
   biotic and abiotic stressors. Climate change affects the shrimp
   aquaculture directly by extreme weather events and seasonal variations,
   and indirectly alter the primary and secondary productivity, structure
   and composition of the ecosystems or by influencing the availability of
   fishmeal, fish oil and other goods and services required for aquaculture
   farmers. The perceptions of farmers on the impacts of climate change on
   shrimp aquaculture in inland and coastal areas of Krishna District,
   Andhra Pradesh are discussed. Cyclone and flood were perceived by all
   the farmers, whereas irregular season, high temperature, heavy rain and
   drought were perceived by 79, 89, 91 and 5 \% of farmers, respectively.
   Environmental, biological, and economic impacts of climate change
   drivers on aquaculture indicated 20 to 30 \% loss due to seasonal
   variations and 50 to 100\% loss due to extremely heavy rainfall, flood
   and cyclones. The economic risk rating was high with flood followed by
   the cyclone and the magnitude was more in coastal areas compared to
   inland areas. There is no universally applicable list of adaptation
   measures and need to be evaluated for individual aquaculture systems.
   Autonomous and planned adaptation measures to be implemented by farmers,
   researchers and policymakers are discussed for climate-resilient
   aquaculture. Planned adaptive measures are either at the primary level
   or non-existence, hence policy initiatives are required to formulate
   planned adaptive measures to enhance the adaptive capacity of the
   farmers.},

Title = {Preparing for Sea-Level Rise through Adaptive Managed Retreat of a New
   Zealand Stormwater and Wastewater Network},
Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise increasingly affects low-lying and exposed coastal
   communities due to climate change. These communities rely upon the
   delivery of stormwater and wastewater services which are often
   co-located underground in coastal areas. Due to sea-level rise and
   associated compounding climate-related hazards, managing these networks
   will progressively challenge local governments as climate change
   advances. Thus, responsible agencies must reconcile maintaining Levels
   of Service as the impacts of climate change worsen over the coming
   decades and beyond. A critical question is whether such networks can
   continue to be adapted/protected over time to retain Levels of Service,
   or whether eventual retreat may be the only viable adaptation option? If
   so, at what performance threshold? In this paper, we explore these
   questions for stormwater and wastewater, using a dynamic adaptive
   pathway planning (DAPP) approach designed to address thresholds and
   increasing risk over time. Involving key local stakeholders, we here use
   DAPP to identify thresholds for stormwater and wastewater services and
   retreat options, and for developing a comprehensive and area-specific
   retreat strategy comprising pathway portfolios, retreat phases,
   potential land use changes, and for exploring pathway conflicts and
   synergies. The result is a prototype for an area near Wellington, New
   Zealand, where a managed retreat of water infrastructure is being
   considered at some future juncture. Dynamic adaptive strategies for
   managed retreats can help to reduce future disruption from coastal
   flooding, signal land use changes early, inform maintenance, and allow
   for gradual budget adjustments by the agencies that can manage
   expenditure over time. We present this stepwise process in a pathway
   form that can be communicated spatially and visually, thereby making a
   retreat a more manageable, sequenced, adaptation option for water
   agencies, and the communities they serve.},

Title = {Climate Change Risk and Reduction Approaches in Pakistan},
Booktitle = {DISASTER RISK REDUCTION APPROACHES IN PAKISTAN},
Series = {Disaster Risk Reduction},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {195-216},
Abstract = {Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries facing the risk of
   climate change, despite contributing very little to the global
   greenhouse gas emissions. The 2010 Global Climate Risk Index of
   Germanwatch ranked it first among some 180 nations of the world. The
   country's vulnerabilities are high due to heavy dependence of its
   economy on agriculture, which is highly climate sensitive; water supply
   of its rivers from the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayan glaciers, which are
   reported to be receding due to global warming; and increased risks to
   its coastal areas (particularly to Karachi, its largest city and the hub
   of its industrial activity and international trade) and the Indus
   deltaic region due to sea level rise and increasing cyclonic activity.
   Compounding the problems are the extreme weather events, which have
   enhanced in their frequency and intensity in the country. An analysis of
   data from 52 meteorological stations in Pakistan over a 40-year period
   (1961-2000) shows that the frequency of highest daily temperature and
   heaviest rainfall events have increased by the passing decades.
   Moreover, at the turn of the century, the country experienced the worst
   drought of its history and in the first decade of the twenty-first
   century saw several extreme weather events including the history's worst
   flood in 2010. In terms of risks, climate change poses a major threat to
   all dimensions of sustainable development, economic, social as well as
   environmental. It is likely to have widespread impacts across various
   sectors and ecosystems such as food, water and energy; forests and
   biodiversity; coastal and marine environment; as well as on the
   occurrence and intensity of climate related hazards such as floods and
   droughts. This Chapter examines first the climate variability trends
   that Indicate continuous warming. It then evaluates vulnerabilities and
   risks posed by climate change, which are increasing with time
   particularly in terms of enhanced climate related hazards. Finally, it
   analyzes the key approaches and measures that have been adopted to
   reduce the risks posed by climate change.},

Title = {Current systematic carbon-cycle observations and the need for
   implementing a policy-relevant carbon observing system},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Number = {13},
Pages = {3547-3602},
Abstract = {A globally integrated carbon observation and analysis system is needed
   to improve the fundamental understanding of the global carbon cycle, to
   improve our ability to project future changes, and to verify the
   effectiveness of policies aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
   increase carbon sequestration. Building an integrated carbon observation
   system requires transformational advances from the existing sparse,
   exploratory framework towards a dense, robust, and sustained system in
   all components: anthropogenic emissions, the atmosphere, the ocean, and
   the terrestrial biosphere. The paper is addressed to scientists,
   policymakers, and funding agencies who need to have a global picture of
   the current state of the (diverse) carbon observations. We identify the
   current state of carbon observations, and the needs and notional
   requirements for a global integrated carbon observation system that can
   be built in the next decade. A key conclusion is the substantial
   expansion of the ground-based observation networks required to reach the
   high spatial resolution for CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and for carbon stocks
   for addressing policy-relevant objectives, and attributing flux changes
   to underlying processes in each region. In order to establish flux and
   stock diagnostics over areas such as the southern oceans, tropical
   forests, and the Arctic, in situ observations will have to be
   complemented with remote-sensing measurements. Remote sensing offers the
   advantage of dense spatial coverage and frequent revisit. A key
   challenge is to bring remote-sensing measurements to a level of
   long-term consistency and accuracy so that they can be efficiently
   combined in models to reduce uncertainties, in synergy with ground-based
   data. Bringing tight observational constraints on fossil fuel and land
   use change emissions will be the biggest challenge for deployment of a
   policy-relevant integrated carbon observation system. This will require
   in situ and remotely sensed data at much higher resolution and density
   than currently achieved for natural fluxes, although over a small land
   area (cities, industrial sites, power plants), as well as the inclusion
   of fossil fuel CO2 proxy measurements such as radiocarbon in CO2 and
   carbon-fuel combustion tracers. Additionally, a policy-relevant carbon
   monitoring system should also provide mechanisms for reconciling
   regional top-down (atmosphere-based) and bottom-up (surface-based) flux
   estimates across the range of spatial and temporal scales relevant to
   mitigation policies. In addition, uncertainties for each observation
   data-stream should be assessed. The success of the system will rely on
   long-term commitments to monitoring, on improved international
   collaboration to fill gaps in the current observations, on sustained
   efforts to improve access to the different data streams and make
   databases interoperable, and on the calibration of each component of the
   system to agreed-upon international scales.},

Title = {Confronting climate change: Adaptation vs. migration in Small Island
   Developing States?},
Journal = {RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper examines the adaptation policy of Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS) facing climate change. We consider a dynamic economy with
   the following ingredients: (i) natural capital is an input in local
   production that is degraded as a result of climate change; (ii) the
   government has two instruments to cope with climate-related damages: it
   can adjust the population size thanks to migration policies and/or it
   can undertake adaptation measures in order to slow the degradation of
   natural assets; (iii) expatriates send remittances back home. We
   identify two critical conditions on the fundamentals of the economy that
   helps under-stand the features of the optimal policy. We especially show
   that in most situations, the migration policy is a valuable instrument.
   Calibrating the model for Caribbean SIDS, we find that the optimal
   policy of the Caribbean region displays heterogeneity, that is explained
   by the different degradation rate, population size, and endowment in
   natural capital. We also highlight that the higher the climate damages,
   the higher the incentives to conduct an active adaptation policy,
   combining conventional adaptation actions and migration. (c) 2022

Abstract = {While Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) face many
   challenges in their pursuit of sustainable resource development, climate
   change is among the most pressing and least addressed. Research has
   identified a host of expected or ongoing physical, biological,
   ecological, and social impacts of climate change on the marine
   environment, creating a strong climate change adaptation imperative for
   RFMOs. Through a case study of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
   Commission (IATTC), we describe two serious limitations of current RFMO
   climate change adaptation strategies: (1) a weakened efficacy of
   resource management and conservation policies caused by viewing climate
   change as a general climate stressor rather than a unique environmental
   challenge, and (2) a reliance on incremental policy reform, problematic
   because it may not enable a pace or scale of policy change proportional
   to the sustainable development challenges created by a rapidly changing
   ocean. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of incrementalism and
   outline potential solutions to the environmental and structural
   challenges facing the IATTC and other RFMOs, including the concept of
   adaptation pathways.},

Title = {INDIGENOUS CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PLANNING USING A VALUES-FOCUSED
   APPROACH: A CASE STUDY WITH THE GITGA'AT NATION},

Abstract = {Local values and knowledge can be important components in creating
   robust climate change adaptation strategies for marginalized
   communities. Incorporating local values into the climate change planning
   process in a structured way and effectively using local knowledge not
   only improves the identification of priority actions for climate change
   adaptation, but also supports successful implementation. Much of climate
   change adaptation planning in recent years identifies actions derived
   from expert-driven vulnerability assessments and adaptation actions. Yet
   the values of each community influence how climate change impacts are
   perceived, and what adaptation actions are locally acceptable and will
   have local buy-in for implementation. Thus, it is important that
   planning incorporates local values if the goal is successful adaptation
   to climate change. This paper provides one approach for addressing this
   through a participatory, values-based process for climate change
   adaptation planning. The approach is contextualized through a case study
   of the Gitga'at Nation, located in northern coastal British Columbia,
   Canada, where key values were found to be culturally important food
   sources, culture, environmental resources, self-sufficiency, health,
   infrastructure to enable us to live well, and Gitga'at pride and
   cooperation. These values were used throughout the planning process to
   contextualize climate change impacts on Gitga'at members' way of life
   and to develop and evaluate adaptation actions. It is hoped that this
   case study provides further proof of the utility of values-based
   planning in the context of adaptation planning for marginalized
   communities.},

Title = {Public perception of engineering-based coastal flooding and erosion risk
   mitigation options: Lessons from three European coastal settings},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {87},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {205-209},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent damages and losses associated with coastal floods have generated
   many analyses dealing with overexposure to flood risk, its consequences,
   associated technological choices and governance principles, and what
   seems to be a poor understanding of the causes and consequences of
   floods and working of coastal defences at the local level. While many
   analyses demonstrate that risks are both physically and socially
   constructed, in this paper we go further by analysing risk mitigation
   options (engineering works) as being dual (physically and socially
   constructed) as well. When envisioning mitigation options through
   stakeholders' perception, one can observe a mix of intertwined
   statements associated with the relevance the specific risk that is dealt
   with, dealing with the sometimes incomplete knowledge associated with
   the mitigation option and its performance at reducing risk, and, dealing
   with the value conflicts that may be present when envisioning a
   particular flood risk mitigation strategy. Our research question is
   ``what are the drivers of stakeholder perceptions when envisioning
   engineering-based mitigation options.{''} Through qualitative empirical
   fieldwork conducted in three European coastal settings (Cesenatico,
   Santander and the Gironde Estuary) we demonstrate here that engineered
   mitigation solutions are socially construed by referring to individual
   and collective heuristics associated with these options. These
   heuristics may lead to poor social acceptability of envisioned
   mitigation options, poor acceptability not directly linked to the
   performance in terms of risk reduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A review of the major drivers of the terrestrial carbon uptake:
   model-based assessments, consensus, and uncertainties},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks together sequester >50\% of the
   anthropogenic emissions, and the major uncertainty in the global carbon
   budget is related to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Hence, it is
   important to understand the major drivers of the land carbon uptake to
   make informed decisions on climate change mitigation policies. In this
   paper, we assess the major drivers of the land carbon uptake-CO2
   fertilization, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and land use/land
   cover changes (LULCC)-from existing literature for the historical period
   and future scenarios, focusing on the results from fifth Coupled Models
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The existing literature shows that the
   LULCC fluxes have led to a decline in the terrestrial carbon stocks
   during the historical period, despite positive contributions from CO2
   fertilization and nitrogen deposition. However, several studies find
   increases in the land carbon sink in recent decades and suggest that CO2
   fertilization is the primary driver (up to 85\%) of this increase
   followed by nitrogen deposition (similar to 10\%-20\%). For the 21st
   century, terrestrial carbon stocks are projected to increase in the
   majority of CMIP5 simulations under the representative concentration
   pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6), RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, mainly due to CO2
   fertilization. These projections indicate that the effects of nitrogen
   deposition in future scenarios are small (similar to 2\%-10\%), and
   climate warming would lead to a loss of land carbon. The vast majority
   of the studies consider the effects of only one or two of the drivers,
   impairing comprehensive assessments of the relative contributions of the
   drivers. Further, the broad range in magnitudes and scenario/model
   dependence of the sensitivity factors pose challenges in unambiguous
   projections of land carbon uptake. Improved representation of processes
   such as LULCC, fires, nutrient limitation and permafrost thawing in the
   models are necessary to constrain the present-day carbon cycle and for
   more accurate future projections.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Technologies can help strengthen the resilience of our economy against
   existential climate-risks. We investigate climate change adaptation
   technologies (CCATs) in US patents to understand (1) historical patterns
   and possible drivers of innovation; (2) scientific and technological
   requirements to develop and use CCATs; and (3) CCATs' potential
   technological synergies with mitigation. First, in contrast to
   mitigation, innovation in CCATs only slowly takes off, indicating a
   relatively low awareness of investors for solutions to cope with climate
   risks. We discuss how historical trends in environmental regulation,
   energy prices, and public support may have contributed to patenting in
   CCATs. Second, CCATs form two main clusters: science-intensive ones in
   agriculture, health, and monitoring technologies; and
   engineering-intensive ones in coastal, water, and infrastructure
   technologies. Analyses of technology-specific scientific and
   technological knowledge bases inform directions for how to facilitate
   advancement, transfer and use of CCATs. Lastly, CCATs show strong
   technological complementarities with mitigation as more than 25\% of
   CCATs bear mitigation benefits. While not judging about the
   complementarity of mitigation and adaptation in general, our results
   suggest how policymakers can harness these technological synergies to
   achieve both goals simultaneously.},

   investigate the current adaptation pathways of Asian deltaic cities to
   flooding induced by slow onset events such as urbanization-induced land
   subsidence and sea level rise, by looking at Tokyo, Jakarta, Manila, and
   Ho Chi Minh City as case studies. Evidence from them shows that an
   engineering approach towards flooding adaptation is shaping the future
   of Asian deltaic cities. However, emerging challenges question the
   sustainability of this approach. Recommendations on how to improve

Abstract = {While the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, provides guidelines
   for flood risk management, it is local governments' responsibility to
   delineate their own flood vulnerability, assess their risk, and
   integrate these with planning policies to implement adaptive action.
   However, barriers such as the lack of locally specific data and public
   perceptions about adaptation options mean that local governments must
   address the need for adaptation planning within a context of scientific
   uncertainty, while building public support for difficult choices on
   flood-related climate policy and action. This research demonstrates a
   process to model, visualize and evaluate potential flood impacts and
   adaptation options for the community of Delta, in Metro Vancouver,
   across economic, social and environmental perspectives. Visualizations
   in 2D and 3D, based on hydrological modeling of breach events for
   existing dike infrastructure, future sea level rise and storm surges,
   are generated collaboratively, together with future adaptation scenarios
   assessed against quantitative and qualitative indicators. This
   `visioning package' is being used with staff and a citizens' Working
   Group to assess the performance, policy implications and social
   acceptability of the adaptation strategies. Recommendations based on the
   experience of the initiative are provided that can facilitate
   sustainable future adaptation actions and decision-making in Delta and
   other jurisdictions.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that densely developed and populated urban
   areas experience significant anthropogenic heat flux and elevated
   concentrations of air pollutants and CO2, with consequences for human
   health, thermal comfort, and well-being. This may also affect the
   atmospheric composition and circulation patterns within the urban
   boundary layer, with consequences for local, regional, and global
   climate. One of the resulting local implications is the increase in
   urban air temperature. In this context, the present contribution
   explores urban fabric development and mitigation strategies for two
   locations in the city of Vienna, Austria. Toward this end, the potential
   of specific planning and mitigation strategies regarding urban
   overheating was assessed using a state-of-the-art CFD-based
   (computational fluid dynamics) numeric simulation environment. The
   results display different levels of effectiveness for selected design
   and mitigation measures under a wide range of boundary conditions.},

Title = {Investigating the potential mitigating role of network design measures
   for reducing the environmental impact of maritime Chains: The
   Mediterranean case},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-280},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the past few years, the reduction of maritime emissions has been
   receiving increasing attention in the shipping industry. The main reason
   lies in the growing need to reduce global emissions and the fact that,
   despite its overall environmentally friendly reputation, maritime
   transport is expected to further increase its contribution to pollution
   in the years to come. Not surprisingly, there is a growing interest in
   measures, policies, and initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon
   footprint of shipping activities. In this regard, the present study aims
   to investigate the potential role of network design measures in helping
   to mitigate the environmental impact of maritime transport chains. As
   far as the authors are aware, no previous studies on measures and
   initiatives for reducing maritime emissions have focused on the role of
   network design interventions. This study examines an innovative two-hub
   based Ro-Ro freight network for shipping services between the
   north-western and southeastern Mediterranean shores and uses an
   activity-based methodology to assess its environmental impact and
   compare it with the existing system of regular Ro-Ro connections in the
   area. Numerical results confirm the potential effectiveness of network
   design measures in reducing the emissions of Mediterranean transport
   chains and provide new insights for the future development of more
   effective tactical-operational solutions, based on services integration,
   to support the adoption of more sustainable transport schemes in the
   Mediterranean area.},

   Country-based assessment of climate change impacts in Europe up to 2050},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Alternative fuels are crucial to decarbonize the European maritime
   transport, but their net climate benefits vary with the type of fuel and
   production country. In this study, we assess the energy potential and
   climate change mitigation benefits of using agricultural and forest
   residues in different European countries for drop-in (Fast Pyrolysis,
   Hydrothermal Liquefaction, and Gasification to Fischer-Tropsch fuels or
   Bio-Synthetic Natural Gas) and hydrogen-based biofuels (hydrogen,
   ammonia, and methanol) with or without carbon capture and storage (CCS).
   Our results show the combinations of countries and biofuel options that
   successfully achieve the decar-bonization targets set by the FuelEU
   Maritime initiative for the next years, including a prospective analysis
   that include technological changes projected for the biofuel supply
   chains until 2050. With the current technologies, the largest greenhouse
   gas (GHG) mitigation potential per year at a European scale is obtained
   with bio-synthetic natural gas and hydrothermal liquefaction. Among
   carbon-free biofuels, ammonia currently has higher mitiga-tion, but
   hydrogen can achieve a lower GHG intensity per unit of energy with the
   projected decarbonization of the electricity mixes until 2050. The full
   deployment of CCS can further accelerate the decarbonization of the
   maritime sector. Choosing the most suitable renewable fuels requires a
   regional perspective and a transition roadmap where countries coordinate
   actions to meet ambitious climate targets.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Concerns over climate change and climatic variability are growing in
   South Asia because of the potential detrimental impacts of these
   phenomena on livelihoods. Such growing concerns demonstrate a need to
   assess how farmers simultaneously cope with extreme events and adapt to
   climatic variability. Based on household surveys of 2660 farm families
   conducted in Nepal's Terai, coastal Bangladesh, and the Indian state of
   Bihar, this paper seeks to (1) explore farmers' coping strategies under
   adverse weather events; (2) identify key adaptation measures used by
   farmers; and (3) explore the policy interventions required to adjust
   agriculture to climatic variability. The study reveals that migration is
   the most important coping strategy of the households in Bihar and
   coastal Bangladesh, while reliance on credit markets is the most
   important in Terai. Farmers in the areas with higher rainfall
   variability pursue a higher number of coping strategies compared to
   farmers in areas with lower rainfall variability. Food available months
   are also higher in areas with higher rainfall variability. Across all
   sites, the most frequently mentioned adaptive practices are changing
   cropping patterns and adoption of resilient crop varieties. A large
   number of farmers place emphasis on breeding crop varieties that
   tolerate adverse weather. Governments should implement a number of
   planned activities to cope with adverse events, with the aim that these
   activities would be synergistic with adaptation to climate change.},

Title = {Changes in the characteristics of `wet' and `dry' Red Sea Trough over
   the Eastern Mediterranean in CMIP5 climate projections},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {The Eastern Mediterranean resides on the border between the temperate
   and semi-arid and arid climate zones, and is thus influenced by both
   mid-latitude and sub-tropical weather systems. Precipitation and extreme
   weather in this region are mainly associated with either Cyprus Lows or
   the ``wet{''} Red Sea Troughs. Current regional climate projections
   indicate that the region may become warmer and drier in future decades.
   Here, we analyze the influence of enhanced greenhouse gas forcing on the
   climatological properties of the `wet' and `dry' Red Sea Trough (WRST \&
   DRST, respectively). With this aim, a regional synoptic classification
   and a downscaling algorithm based on past analogs are applied to
   eighteen rain stations over the main ground water basins in Israel. The
   algorithms are applied to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for 1986-2005
   and to eight CMIP5 model simulations for the historical (1986-2005) and
   end of the century (2081-2100) climate conditions according to the
   RCP8.5 scenario. For the historical period, the CMIP5 models are largely
   able to represent the characteristics of the Red Sea Trough. Based on
   the multi-model mean, significant changes are found for WRST and DRST
   for the late XXI Century. First, an increase in the meridional pressure
   gradient is found for both the WRST and the DRST, implying stronger
   horizontal winds. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the occurrence
   of the WRST (- 20\%) and a significant increase in the frequency of the
   DRST (+ 19\%) are identified. Accordingly, the persistence of the WRST
   decreases (- 9\%), while for DRST increases (+ 9\%). The decline in the
   frequency of WRST occurs primarily in the transition seasons, while the
   increase for DRST is found throughout the wet season. In total, the
   daily rainfall associated with the WRST system is projected to
   significantly decline (- 37\%) by the end of the XXI century. These
   results document the projected changes in a dominant synoptic system in
   this area, which can facilitate a better estimation of the arising
   challenges, e.g., related to shortage of water resources and associated
   political unrest, reduced agricultural potential, and increased air
   pollution and forest fires. Such a pathway can ultimately foster novel
   mitigation strategies for water resources management and regional
   climate change adaptation.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {120},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-179},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change is expected to have a range of health
   impacts, some of which are already apparent. Public health adaptation is
   imperative, but there has been little discussion of how to increase
   adaptive capacity and resilience in public health systems.
   OBJECTIVES: We explored possible explanations for the lack of work on
   adaptive capacity, outline climate-health challenges that may lie
   outside public health's coping range, and consider changes in practice
   that could increase public health's adaptive capacity.
   METHODS: We conducted a substantive, interdisciplinary literature review
   focused on climate change adaptation in public health, social learning,
   and management of socioeconomic systems exhibiting dynamic complexity.
   DISCUSSION: There are two competing views of how public health should
   engage climate change adaptation. Perspectives differ on whether climate
   change will primarily amplify existing hazards, requiring enhancement of
   existing public health functions, or present categorically distinct
   threats requiring innovative management strategies. In some contexts,
   distinctly climate-sensitive health threats may overwhelm public
   health's adaptive capacity. Addressing these threats will require
   increased emphasis on institutional learning, innovative management
   strategies, and new and improved tools. Adaptive management, an
   iterative framework that embraces uncertainty, uses modeling, and
   integrates learning, may be a useful approach. We illustrate its
   application to extreme heat in an urban setting.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increasing public health capacity will be necessary for
   certain climate-health threats. Focusing efforts to increase adaptive
   capacity in specific areas, promoting institutional learning, embracing
   adaptive management, and developing tools to facilitate these processes
   are important priorities and can improve the resilience of local public
   health systems to climate change.},

Title = {The economic impacts of restricting black carbon emissions on cargo

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {159-176},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Since black carbon (BC) has become one of the most harmful pollutants
   and partly accelerated the melting of the Arctic sea ice,
   internationally mandatory policy to limit black carbon emissions in the
   whole Polar Code Area is on the agenda. To cope with this policy, some
   potential measures from both the coastal government and the shipowners,
   as well as the economic impacts of these measures, are considered in
   this paper. We analyze the daily navigation profits and the
   corresponding BC emissions after these measures are adopted. Since
   equipment-related cost is usually regarded as fixed and cannot be
   calculated on a daily basis, this paper also proposes an equipment
   investment payback period to access the time needed to achieve a balance
   between the investments and the profits of applying the equipment. A
   case of a dry bulk carrier navigating through the Northwest Passage is
   presented for concrete quantitative analysis. The results indicate that
   wind propulsion system can help shipowners mitigate the largest amount
   of BC emission. Wind-driven generators, which are used for auxiliary
   generating system, are the most economic-beneficial to shipowners under
   the current technology environment. Besides, we found that BC emission
   tax rate set by coastal governments plays an important role in the
   selection of different measures by shipowners.},

Journal = {CURRENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {99},
Number = {4},
Pages = {444-449},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {The Government of India has announced the Greening India Mission (GIM)
   under the National Climate Change Action Plan. The Mission aims to
   restore and afforest about 10 mha over the period 2010-2020 under
   different sub-missions covering moderately dense and open forests,
   scrub/grasslands, mangroves, wetlands, croplands and urban areas. Even
   though the main focus of the Mission is to address mitigation and
   adaptation aspects in the context of climate change, the adaptation
   component is inadequately addressed. There is a need for increased
   scientific input in the preparation of the Mission. The mitigation
   potential is estimated by simply multiplying global default biomass
   growth rate values and area. It is incomplete as it does not include all
   the carbon pools, phasing, differing growth rates, etc. The mitigation
   potential estimated using the Comprehensive Mitigation Analysis Process
   model for the GIM for the year 2020 has the potential to offset 6.4\% of
   the projected national greenhouse gas emissions, compared to the GIM
   estimate of only 1.5\%, excluding any emissions due to harvesting or
   disturbances. The selection of potential locations for different
   interventions and species choice under the GIM must be based on the use
   of modelling, remote sensing and field studies. The forest sector
   provides an opportunity to promote mitigation and adaptation synergy,
   which is not adequately addressed in the GIM. Since many of the
   interventions proposed are innovative and limited scientific knowledge
   exists, there is need for an unprecedented level of collaboration
   between the research institutions and the implementing agencies such as
   the Forest Departments, which is currently non-existent. The GIM could
   propel systematic research into forestry and climate change issues and
   thereby provide global leadership in this new and emerging science.},

Abstract = {In order to evaluate ocean fertilization in the larger context of other
   proposed strategies for reducing the threat of the global warming, a
   wide range of different climate change mitigation approaches are
   compared in terms of their long-term potential, stage of development,
   relative costs and potential risks, as well as public acceptance. This
   broad comparative analysis is carried out for the following climate
   change mitigation strategies: supply-side and end-use efficiency
   improvements, terrestrial and geological carbon sequestration, CO2 ocean
   disposal and iron fertilization, nuclear power, and renewable energy
   generation from biomass, passive solar, solar thermal, photovoltaics,
   hydroelectric and wind. In addition, because of the inherent problems of
   conducting an objective comparative cost-benefit analysis, 2
   non-technological solutions to global warming are also discussed:
   curbing population growth and transitioning to a steady-state economy.},

Title = {Biodiversity offsets for offshore wind farm projects: The current
   situation in Europe},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {172-183},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The European Union's energy policy aims to increase the proportion of
   energy derived from renewable sources in Europe. Marine renewable
   energy, offshore wind energy especially, contributes to the renewable
   energy mix. Offshore wind farms appear to be clean, and are supported by
   governments and NGOs as a way to reduce the use of conventional energy
   resources and thus decrease greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   developing infrastructure in marine areas can impact marine ecosystems.
   European directives ask offshore wind farm developers to carry out an
   Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) including a mitigation hierarchy,
   i.e. envisaging measures that would avoid, reduce, and if possible
   offset significant adverse effects on ecosystems and human activities.
   This paper reviews EIA reports from seven European countries and is
   focused on impacts on the open water marine environment. According to
   the reports, measures have been taken for avoiding and reducing impacts,
   so there should be no significant negative residual impacts and hence no
   need of offsets. But the mitigation hierarchy for ecological impacts
   seems to have been incompletely implemented, because it is unlikely that
   there are no significant residual impacts. The paper proposes some
   technical and ecological explanations, followed by some governance and
   social explanations, for the absence of biodiversity offsets. (C) 2014

Volume = {67},
Pages = {171-178},

Abstract = {Fisheries resources play a major role in the national economy and to
   food security in Solomon Islands. Climate change is likely to have a
   substantial impact on fish production that can lead to a fragile food
   security condition in the country. This paper assesses the potential
   economic impact of three important climate change adaptation strategies
   - natural resource management (NRM), fish aggregating devices (FAD) and
   aquaculture - in Solomon Islands. The study used a country-specific
   partial equilibrium economic model with six fish sub-sectors and
   analyzed potential impact of alternate climate change adaptation
   strategies for 2035 and 2050. The modeling and scenario analyses show
   that total fish demand is likely to surpass domestic fish production in
   2050. Without appropriate climate adaptation strategy, per capita
   consumption of domestically produced fish will decline, which has
   serious negative food security implications for the country. The
   economic (welfare) analysis conducted based on modeling results show
   that the national level net economic gains due to climate change
   adaptation strategies are substantial. If cost and topographic
   conditions permit, low-cost inshore FADs are expected to be a good
   mechanism for augmenting domestic supplies of tuna and similar species
   in Solomon Islands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We present the global general circulation model IPSL-CM5 developed to
   study the long-term response of the climate system to natural and
   anthropogenic forcings as part of the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This model includes an interactive
   carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric
   chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it
   represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio-geochemical
   processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an
   Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a
   multitude of configurations associated with different boundary
   conditions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and
   interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model
   components and explains how they were coupled and used to simulate
   historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different
   scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5
   model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections associated
   with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different
   Representative Concentration Pathways considered by CMIP5 and several
   scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by
   CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming projections
   primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there
   is potential for an aggressive mitigation policy to limit global warming
   to about two degrees, and that the behavior of some components of the
   climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional
   Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the
   twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario.
   Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes
   depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming
   (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these
   changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The
   representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown
   to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the
   magnitude and pattern of the projected climate changes.},

Abstract = {Climate change induced sea-level rise poses serious threats to valuable
   coastal ecosystems like mangroves. However, projections of sea level
   rise at local level under different scenarios and for different time
   scale set forth greatest challenges to climate modelers. Further,
   information on location specific sea-level rise projections at local
   level are seldom available and rarely in the possession for the coastal
   managers and adaptation planners to frame suitable adaptation strategies
   to sea-level rise. In this context, this paper endeavors to provide
   local level sea-level rise projection for the Pichavaram mangrove region
   of the Tamil Nadu coast, India. A climate simulator model based on IPCC
   AR4 (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) has been used to project the
   sea-level rise at local level under different scenarios. The results
   revealed that the study area may experience sea-level rise ranging from
   22.40 to 53.70 cm by 2100. Thus, the objective of this paper is to
   provide hands on information to facilitate coastal manager and
   adaptation planners to frame location specific and time based mangrove
   adaptation strategies to sea-level rise.},

Abstract = {Geologic carbon storage in deep saline aquifers is considered a feasible
   and possible approach of mitigating the problem of increasing greenhouse
   gas emissions. However, there are latent risks in which carbon dioxide
   (CO2) could migrate from the deep saline formations to shallower
   aquifers. In the event of a significant CO2 leakage to an underground
   source of drinking water, CO2 will dissolve in the water, thereby
   increasing its acidity, which could potentially enhance the solubility
   of various aquifer constituents, including hazardous compounds,
   subsequently compromising groundwater quality due to increased
   concentration of aqueous metals. In this paper we explore the
   possibility of detecting such leakage by the use of laser-induced
   breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The experiments were conducted in calcium
   chloride solution at three pressures of 10, 50, and 120 bar. To evaluate
   the direct effect of elevated CO2 on the intensity of calcium emission
   lines (422.67 and 393.37 nm), we also performed experiments with pure
   nitrogen (N-2) gas, offering large water solubility contrast. We found
   that when performed in presence of CO2, LIBS showed only a modest
   decrease in Ca emission intensity from 10 to 120 bar compared to N-2.
   These results indicate that LIBS is a viable tool for measuring
   brine/water contents in high-pressure CO2 environment and can be applied
   for monitoring CO2 leakage and displaced brine migration.},

Title = {Adaptive management of ecological systems under partial observability},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {224},
Pages = {9-15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Adaptive management has a long history in ecology and conservation.
   Uncertainty in both the state of a system and the model defining its
   dynamics are fundamental challenges in adaptive management of complex
   ecological systems. Traditional approaches in conservation biology often
   ignore one or both sources of uncertainty due to the computational
   complexity involved. Here, we show that underestimating the role of
   uncertainty in both model estimation and decision-making results in
   aggressive decision rules which can potentially lead to the dramatic
   decline and possible collapse of a population, species, or ecosystem. We
   propose an approximate solution to adaptive management of ecological
   systems under both model and state uncertainties that is computationally
   feasible and applicable to complex management problems and provide a
   software for detailed implementation of our method,
   http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1161521. We apply the proposed method in a
   marine ecosystem management context and show that by learning from
   historical data and arrival of new observations, decision makers can
   adapt their policies to avoid decline in the population and reach a
   sustainable population stability.},

Abstract = {With the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) linking all the
   ships and other water vessels with different types of sensors and
   surveillances for reading, observation and monitoring the existing
   system, Bangladesh Maritime Safety Administration can calibrate with IMO
   2050 Decarbonization Charter and phase out the emission of greenhouse
   gases to a significant level from the ships and vessels operating in the
   domestic and international waterways. Furthermore, according to the
   study, the adaptive measures, thriving in the enforcement of the
   environmental safety regulations, adoption of new technologies, use of
   alternative fuels, speed and trim optimisation and speed reduction,
   applications of route planning, upskilling the workforce, etc. in the
   context of Bangladesh, eventually create a broader and reliable hub to
   collect specific data from the source of polluters and help Bangladesh
   Maritime Safety Administration improve energy efficacy performance of
   the ships, especially in Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) Energy efficiency
   Existing Ship index (EEXI), Energy efficiency Design index (EEDI),
   Carbon Intensity Index (CII) and in Fuel Oil Reduction Strategy (FORS)
   and thus reducing carbon emission to a significant level.
   Collecting primary and secondary data, the paper empirically studies the
   prospects of installing sensor technologies and surveillances in all the
   ships and water vessels for fuel efficiency, engine efficiency, carbon
   emission, methane emission, volatile organic compound emission, and
   other GHG emissions. The paper maintains that being able to holistically
   connect all the vehicles operating under Bangladesh Maritime Safety
   Administration to a single network commonly could create a comprehensive
   way to facilitate operational best practices, enforcing and implementing
   the regulatory laws effectively, preparing the budget well, and
   proposing changes in places where they are duly applicable.
   While assessing the measurements to align with IMO 2050 Decarbonization
   Charters, the focus has been duly placed on the cost of technologies,
   shortage of resources, human capital shortage, administrative
   challenges, policy constraints, operational challenges, and
   environmental impacts. Again, IMO 2050 Decarbonization parameters were
   carefully studied before mapping out the integration of IoT into
   systems. The possible measures categorised as the short-term,
   middle-term and long-term instruments are proposed to be implemented
   phase by phase, encouraging the stakeholders to enhance technical
   cooperation and capacity-building activities. The study also highlights
   how the application of IoT and augmented intelligence in the shipping
   industry can be a breakthrough technology, helping the stakeholders to
   enforce IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charter, formulate policies
   appropriately, use alternative low carbon and zero-carbon fuels and
   innovative technologies to enhance further the energy efficacy of the
   ships and other water vehicles. The paper concludes that giving tax
   rebates and financial incentives for going green and being aligned with
   IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charters could inspire the stakeholders.},

Title = {Assessing household perception, autonomous adaptation and economic value
   of adaptation benefits: Evidence from West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia},

Abstract = {Climate change is causing sea-level rise, intense and frequent storm
   surge flooding, and significant shoreline erosion in Malaysian coastal
   areas. Consequently, coastal properties, infrastructure, and livelihoods
   are threatened. It has become apparent that adaptation at the household
   and community level is necessary to offset the adverse impacts of
   coastal hazards. The community needs to be made aware of the risks,
   acquire knowledge about adaptation options, and be empowered to take
   their own actions. Public perception and preference are therefore
   crucial for design and implementation of effective planning for climate
   change. Thus, this study assesses households' perception, adaptation
   measures and empirically estimates willingness to pay and preference for
   planned adaptation measures to guide policy instruments through public
   engagement. In Malaysia, ten highly vulnerable coastal areas in the
   Selangor coast were surveyed at the household level (n 1/4 1016) through
   face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Regarding
   households' perception and adaptation methods, most of the households in
   the highly exposed areas perceived less risk of inundation and sea-level
   rise threat and adopted less proactive adaptation and limited risk
   reduction be-haviours during the extreme event. The study found that
   66.9\% of households were willing to pay for planned adaptation measures
   despite the limited income capabilities and in favour of moderate
   adaptation (23.9\%). The binomial and ordinal regression results
   indicated that the probability of willingness to pay for planned
   adaptation measures significantly increases with age, prior exposure to
   coastal hazards, awareness, risk perception, community participation,
   being affected by property damage and loss of income due to extreme
   events. With increased monthly household income and access to
   telecommunication services, households will probably pay higher for
   better adaptation measures. A significant amount of perceived yearly
   adaptation benefits in the coastal districts revealed the economic value
   of extensive (22,969.50 MYR/5462.43 USD), moderate (21,853.20
   MYR/5196.96 USD) and minimal adaptation measures (8022.90 MYR/1907.94
   USD) that can be utilised to incentivise coastal adaptation plans. The
   findings suggest policies to incorporate social values to reduce
   vulnerability, enhance community resilience, and contribute to the
   knowledge gap of adaptation research in the coastal areas.},

Title = {The Impact of Offshore Wind Farms on Marine Ecosystems: A Review Taking
   an Ecosystem Services Perspective},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {101},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in renewable energy generation from wind has
   increased concerns about the impacts that wind arrays have on the marine
   environment and what these impacts mean for society. One method for
   identifying the impacts of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on human welfare
   is through the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. Using an
   ecosystem services approach, this paper reviews the impacts of OWFs on
   the ecosystem services delivered by marine environments. During the
   construction phase, supporting services such as reduced energy capture
   and nutrient cycling are changed due to the introduction of hard
   substrate and the reduction in soft sediment habitat at turbine bases.
   This may lead to changes in all other ecosystem services, both negative
   and positive. Quantifying these changes, however, is a challenge partly
   due to data limitations and a lack of clear understanding of the impacts
   of OWFs on the marine ecosystems. Scientific effort needs to
   quantitatively explore the impacts of OWFs on ecosystem functionality
   and the gathering of data that enables the assessment of changes to
   ecosystem services. Data needed to better quantify and value the impacts
   of OWFs on ecosystem services are suggested. The development of methods
   which integrate socioeconomic valuation of ecosystem services into the
   evaluation of renewable energy devices compliments efforts in assessing
   the environmental impacts and should enable a holistic assessment of the
   impact of renewable energy production and greenhouse gas mitigation
   technologies on the U. K. carbon footprint.},

Title = {Effect of spatial adaptation measures on flood risk: study of coastal
   floods in Belgium},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {413-425},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Flood risk in coastal zones is projected to increase due to climate
   change and socioeconomic changes. Over the last decades, population
   growth, increases in wealth, and urban expansion have been found to be
   the main causes for increasing losses in coastal areas. These changes
   may, however, be offset by appropriate management measures. The main
   goal of this study is to assess future changes in flood risk and the
   effectiveness of flood risk adaptation measures for the coastal zone in
   Flanders, Belgium. In order to achieve this, we set up a modeling
   framework to assess the future flood risk of the Belgian coast including
   climatic and socioeconomic projections, and used this model to assess
   the effectiveness of two spatial adaptation measures:
   compartmentalization and land-use zoning. In this modeling framework, a
   land-use model, an inundation model, and a damage model were combined to
   calculate expected annual damage. Results show that without adaptation
   measures, future flood risk would increase substantially.
   Compartmentalization would result in an average flood risk reduction of
   approximately 50 \% for both the baseline situation and future
   scenarios. Land-use zoning would result in smaller flood risk
   reductions, averaging between 6 and 10 \%. Except for the most extreme
   climate change scenario, compartmentalization would successfully offset
   the combined adverse effects of socioeconomic growth and climate change
   on flood risk for this case study. For both compartmentalization and
   zoning, large differences have been found in their effectiveness at the
   local level, implying that the choice of adaptation measures should be
   tailored to local characteristics.},

Title = {On the wrong track: Sustainable and low-emission blue food diets to
   mitigate climate change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Seafood and other aquatic food (blue food) are often advocated as
   sustainable protein sources crucial to meeting global food demand.
   Consumption choices allow citizens to take actions that reduce the
   environmental burden of food production and tackle the climate crisis.
   Here we used a high-resolution Spanish national-level dataset collected
   from 12,500 households between 1999 and 2021 as a study case to assess
   trends in blue food consumption concerning sources, types and stressors
   resulting from their production. By aggregating species groups according
   to source, we found an overall reduction in the consumption of most wild
   species. For farmed species, we found a pronounced increase in the
   consumption of carnivorous fish and an overall decrease in low
   trophic-level species consumption, such as bivalves. Using published
   studies, we estimated greenhouse gases, nitrogen, and phosphorus
   emissions to assess trends in environmental footprint. Low performance
   was associated with the consumption of high trophic-level species
   intensively farmed in distant regions, such as carnivorous fish, due to
   high stressor emissions related to their production and transport.
   Across all groups, consumption of locally farmed bivalves conduced to
   the lowest stressor emissions, providing an example of `net-zero' blue
   food. Our analysis identified historical trends in the environmental
   footprint of blue food consumption and consumers' choices that promote
   environmentally sustainable diets. It also highlights vast differences
   in the ecological footprint associated with the consumption of
   aquaculture-sourced protein. Based on our assessment, we recommend
   refocusing consumption patterns toward farmed species with small
   environmental footprints, such as locally produced low trophic-level
   species, and implementing policies that increase consumers'
   environmental awareness and minimize food production systems'
   footprints. Considering global blue food demand is predicted to nearly
   double by mid-century, consumers' choices can significantly impact
   sustainable production practices and mitigate climate change.},

   state-of-the-art review},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {239},
Number = {C},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The shipping sector has been under great pressure since the last decade
   to improve its environmental footprint, more so recently with the
   International Maritime Organisation target for a 50\% reduction in
   greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, benchmarked to 2008 levels. These
   challenging goals have increased the interest towards alternative fuels
   and ship energy systems that can offer a more sustainable performance.
   The variety of potential technological solutions along with the multiple
   criteria employed to evaluate the ship energy systems with respect to
   sustainability considerations, renders the decision making process for
   selecting ship energy systems challenging and highlights the need for
   dedicated decision support methods. This study presents a
   state-of-the-art review of the literature on decision support methods
   for enhancing the ship energy systems sustainability. The trends and
   gaps in the literature are identified, based on which, recommendations
   for future research are proposed. This study findings indicate that,
   among others, further research is needed to adapt more holistic
   approaches that include safety and reliability indicators, as well as
   the social aspect of sustainability. This review can be beneficial for
   the maritime industry stakeholders, including policy makers, academics
   and ship owners/ operators. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Urban and community forests play an important role in the overall carbon
   budget of the USA. Accurately quantifying carbon sequestration by these
   forests can provide insight for strategic planning to mitigate
   greenhouse gas effects on climate change. This study provides a new
   methodology to estimate net forest carbon sequestration (FCS) in urban
   and community lands of northern New England using ground based forest
   growth rates, housing density data, satellite derived land cover and
   tree canopy cover maps at the county level. We estimated that the
   region's urban and community forests sequestered 603,200 tC/yr (\$38.7
   million/yr value), contributing 8.2\% of regional net forest ecosystem
   carbon sequestration. The contributions at the state level varied from
   2.3\% in Vermont to 16.6\% in New Hampshire with substantial variation
   at the county level up to 73.3\%. Spatially, contribution rates from
   urban and community forests at the county level were much higher and
   concentrated in southeast portion of NH and southwest portion of ME
   along the coast, and decreased toward inland areas. Our estimated net
   FCS compared reasonably with gross FCS in the region reported by a
   previous study. On average, the net FCS was 34.2\% lower (varying from
   41.9\% lower in Vermont to 28.1\% lower in Maine) than the corresponding
   gross FCS mainly because of a lower regional average net growth rate
   used in this study, compared to the national average gross carbon
   sequestration rate used in the previous study. (C) 2012 Published by

Title = {Assessing Sumatran Peat Vulnerability to Fire under Various Condition of
   ENSO Phases Using Machine Learning Approaches},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran
   peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
   The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of
   fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus,
   assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the
   underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation
   strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran
   peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and
   Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used
   climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e.,
   below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to
   anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to
   forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to
   assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an
   ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e.,
   random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted
   regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better
   compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within
   Sumatran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of
   peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the
   anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat
   vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with
   variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO
   phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support
   the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for
   identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland
   vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau's peatland as
   being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore,
   the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored
   to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within
   peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded
   peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with
   global climate change.},

Title = {A framework for assessing the potential effectiveness of adaptation
   policies: Coastal risks and sea-level rise in the Maldives},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},

Abstract = {Effective policies that integrate climate change considerations are
   crucial for successful adaptation to increasing climate risks. While
   there is an abundant normative literature proposing potential effective
   ways to adapt, there is a lack of empirical literature on current risk
   and adaptation policy and its potential effectiveness. Studying existing
   policies can help to reveal existing constraints, draw inferences about
   performance and design future policies. However, there is no established
   method for assessing risk management and adaptation policies. Addressing
   these gaps, we developed an analytical framework, combining and
   extending existing approaches, to assess the potential policy
   effectiveness in dealing with climate risks. The framework merges
   aspects of climate integration, policy coherence and compliance.
   Applying this framework to coastal risk management and coastal
   adaptation policies in the Maldives, we conducted a desk review of
   policy documents and semi-structured interviews with coastal policy
   experts and stakeholders. We find five policies addressing coastal risks
   and adaptation. One of these integrates sea-level rise considerations
   but is not legally binding. A key constraint on policy coherence are
   static approaches that ignore the variance in hydrodynamic hazard across
   the archipelago. Moreover, compliance is constrained by low capacities
   to monitor actual land use, political influence on the allocation of
   coastal protections and insufficient coastal protection budgets. Based
   on these findings, we expect that coastal policies are ill-prepared for
   dealing with sea-level rise and that scaling-up sea-level rise
   integration into policy is a critical first step towards improving this.},

Title = {Monitoring and evaluation for adaptive coastal management},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {51-57},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Monitoring and evaluation is a critical component of adaptive
   management, enabling adjustment of management actions and the
   assumptions upon which they are based. Despite the recognised need for
   adaptive management of the coastal zone, the way in which monitoring and
   evaluation can support practice is not often considered. Monitoring
   involves activities that measure the effectiveness of actions, whereas
   evaluation involves the interpretation of that information. In the first
   national study of its type, we analysed the extent that monitoring and
   evaluation was used to support adaptive management in the coastal zone
   in Australia. An on-line survey of 70 practitioners found 54 (77\%)
   conducted monitoring and evaluation, and of these, only 25 (46\%) used
   it for adapting management, and 17 (32\%) for evaluating management
   effectiveness and assumptions. Use of monitoring and evaluation for
   adapting management was significantly correlated with organisation type,
   but not with perceived sufficiency of monitoring and evaluation, or the
   extent it informed decision-making. Assessment breadth was highly
   variable. Organisations who used monitoring and evaluation to adapt
   management and test assumptions were significantly more likely to
   conduct broad assessment, although assessment of socio-economic
   condition, resources and activities were least likely to be assessed.
   This has implications for the types of management decisions monitoring
   and evaluation can inform. For example, to determine which actions are
   most cost effective in preventing coastal erosion, both resources and
   outcomes need to be assessed. Overall, our results indicate a propensity
   for organisations to claim adaptive behaviour, but evaluation design
   does not facilitate it. Inappropriate design, insufficient resources
   (financial, technical skills), and concern for assessment scale
   (including the need to share information across organisations to inform
   regionally meaningful assessments) impede more adaptive behaviour.
   Capacity building in the use of evaluation frameworks designed to
   specifically support learning would enhance adaptive coastal management
   in Australia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Revealing dynamic impacts of socioeconomic factors on air pollution
   changes in Guangdong Province, China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {699},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {The rapid development of cities leads to the frequent occurrence of air
   pollution incidents, which seriously hinders urban sustainability. This
   study develops a dynamic regional air pollution analysis (DRA) model to
   explore the mechanism of air pollutant emission changes. Specifically,
   the emissions differences among various sectors are distinguished by
   multi-angle accounting (MAA) method, and sectors' evolutionary
   trajectories are described by sector evolution analysis (SEA). Through
   combining emission deconstruction analysis (EDA) and structural
   decomposition analysis (SDA), key emission patterns and decisive
   socioeconomic factors are identified. The empirical results indicate
   that different sectors play different roles in the urban emission system
   and differentiated regulation policies should be formulated according to
   their characteristics. Changes of demand and supply patterns can result
   in the fluctuation in regional air pollutant emissions. Exports and
   worker's reward are the most significant contributors to air pollution
   on demand and supply sides, accounting for more than 54.3\% and 44.0\%
   of total emissions, respectively. The final demand level and the primary
   input level are the two biggest drivers of the emission increase, while
   emission intensity is the most crucial factor that offsets the emission
   growth. Also, there are significant differences in demand and supply
   structure. The contribution of primary input structure to emission
   reduction was more significant than that of final demand structure,
   which contributed 14.6\% in 2015. The findings in this study will
   provide reliable information for developing more comprehensive and
   effective mitigation policies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The Paris Agreement objectives will likely halt future declines of

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The Paris Agreement is a multinational initiative to combat climate
   change by keeping a global temperature increase in this century to 2
   degrees C above preindustrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the
   increase to 1.5 degrees C. Until recently, ensembles of coupled climate
   simulations producing temporal dynamics of climate en route to stable
   global mean temperature at 1.5 and 2 degrees C above preindustrial
   levels were not available. Hence, the few studies that have assessed the
   ecological impact of the Paris Agreement used ad-hoc approaches. The
   development of new specific mitigation climate simulations now provides
   an unprecedented opportunity to inform ecological impact assessments.
   Here we project the dynamics of all known emperor penguin (Aptenodytes
   forsteri) colonies under new climate change scenarios meeting the Paris
   Agreement objectives using a climate-dependent-metapopulation model. Our
   model includes various dispersal behaviors so that penguins could
   modulate climate effects through movement and habitat selection. Under
   business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions, we show that 80\% of the
   colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100, thus the total
   abundance of emperor penguins is projected to decline by at least 81\%
   relative to its initial size, regardless of dispersal abilities. In
   contrast, if the Paris Agreement objectives are met, viable emperor
   penguin refuges will exist in Antarctica, and only 19\% and 31\%
   colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100 under the Paris 1.5
   and 2 climate scenarios respectively. As a result, the global population
   is projected to decline by at least by 31\% under Paris 1.5 and 44\%
   under Paris 2. However, population growth rates stabilize in 2060 such
   that the global population will be only declining at 0.07\% under Paris
   1.5 and 0.34\% under Paris 2, thereby halting the global population
   decline. Hence, global climate policy has a larger capacity to safeguard
   the future of emperor penguins than their intrinsic dispersal abilities.},

Abstract = {Increases in sea surface temperature have led to distributional changes
   in many commercially exploited fish species. These changes have already
   led to conflict over mackerel fisheries, arising from demand for fair
   resource apportionment and desire to manage the fishery sustainably. In
   order to develop adaptable management strategies for complex ocean
   fishery systems, policymakers and researchers must move beyond a
   reactive producer-consumer relationship to develop proactive, supportive
   collaborations. The history of U.S. national fisheries management is
   presented as an example of this transition. Building cooperative
   capacity over the last two centuries has lead to a more systematic
   understanding of the oceans, and has led to success in reducing the
   number of overfished stocks. Similar development of cooperation between
   policymakers and researchers on an international scale may be the surest
   way to develop management strategies adaptable enough to withstand
   challenges posed by future climate change.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas and wetlands are on the frontline of climate change and
   variability in Bangladesh. Small-scale coastal and floodplain fishers
   continually face a host of cross-scale stressors, some induced by
   climate change. This research is based on 21-month long field study
   carried out in two coastal and floodplain fishing villages represented
   by two distinct ethnic groups. Adopting nuanced people-centered
   ethnographic approach of field research, this study examines the ways
   small-scale fishers address the arrays of stressors in order to
   construct and reconstruct their livelihoods. Findings of our study
   highlight fishers' capability to plan and construct creative livelihood
   strategies and their adaptability in the face of stresses. We observed
   that fisher's coping strategies comprise a fluid combination of complex
   overlapping set of actions that they undertake based on their
   capabilities, socio-cultural embeddedness, and experiential learning
   under different adverse situations. Broadly, the coping strategies
   embody under economic, physiological, social, survival, institutional
   and religiosity-psychological factors. In this article, considering its
   predominant roles, only economic dimensions of coping actions that
   fishers undertake under unusual and abnormal stresses for survival and
   well-being are analyzed.},

Abstract = {Sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep saline aquifers has
   emerged as a mitigation strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
   to the atmosphere. The large amounts of supercritical CO2 that need to
   be injected into deep saline aquifers may cause large fluid pressure
   buildup. The resulting overpressure will produce changes in the
   effective stress field. This will deform the rock and may promote
   reactivation of sealed fractures or the creation of new ones in the
   caprock seal, which could lead to escape paths for CO2. To understand
   these coupled hydromechanical phenomena, we model an axisymmetric
   horizontal aquifer-caprock system. We study plastic strain propagation
   patterns using a viscoplastic approach. Simulations illustrate that
   plastic strain may propagate through the whole thickness of the caprock
   if horizontal stress is lower than vertical stress. In contrast, plastic
   strain concentrates in the contact between the aquifer and the caprock
   if horizontal stress is larger than vertical stress. Aquifers that
   present a low-permeability boundary experience an additional fluid
   pressure increase once the pressure buildup cone reaches the outer
   boundary. However, fluid pressure does not evolve uniformly in the
   aquifer. While it increases in the low-permeability boundary, it drops
   in the vicinity of the injection well because of the lower viscosity of
   CO2. Thus, caprock stability does not get worse in semi-closed aquifers
   compared to open aquifers. Overall, the caprock acts as a plate that
   bends because of pressure buildup, producing a horizontal extension of
   the upper part of the caprock. This implies a vertical compression of
   this zone, which may produce settlements instead of uplift in
   low-permeability (k <= 10(-18) m(2)) caprocks at early times of
   injection. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {California shellfish farmers: Perceptions of changing ocean conditions
   and strategies for adaptive capacity},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Coastal communities along the U.S. West Coast experience a myriad of
   environmental stressors, including exposure to low pH waters exacerbated
   by ocean acidification (OA). This can result in ecological and social
   consequences, making necessary the exploration and support for locally
   relevant strategies to adapt to OA and other environmental changes. The
   shellfish aquaculture industry along the West Coast is particularly
   vulnerable to OA, given the negative effects of low pH on shellfish
   survival and growth. As such, the social-ecological system exemplified
   by this industry serves as an opportunity to identify and address
   strategies for local adaptation. Through interviews conducted with West
   Coast shellfish farm owners and managers ('growers'), we investigate
   perceptions of OA and environmental change and identify specific
   strategies for adaptation. We find that growers are concerned about OA,
   among many other environmental stressors such as marine pathogens and
   water temperature. However, growers are often unable to attribute
   changes in shellfish survival or health to these environmental factors
   due to a lack of data and the resources and network required to acquire
   and interpret these data. From these interviews, we identify a list of
   adaptive strategies growers employ or would like to employ to improve
   their overall adaptive capacity to multiple stressors (environmental,
   economic, political), which together, allow farms to weather periods of
   OA-induced stress more effectively. Very few studies to date have
   identified specific adaptive strategies derived directly from the
   communities being impacted. This work therefore fills a gap in the
   literature on adaptive capacity by amplifying the voices of those on the
   front lines of climate change and identifying explicit pathways for
   adaptation.},

Abstract = {Background: Climate change is a critical concern globally and small
   island developing states in the Pacific region are especially vulnerable
   to climate change-related phenomena. Pacific Islands have been
   identified as being amongst the countries most vulnerable to the health
   impacts of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to describe
   impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security in Pacific
   Island countries, the mechanisms linking climate change and nutrition,
   and strategies and policies to address them. Method: A literature review
   and documentary analysis was undertaken. Case materials from Pacific
   Island countries are used to illustrate both climate change impacts and
   promising strategies. Results: Climate change exacerbates the existing
   burden of malnutrition. Food and nutrition security are affected through
   changes in local food production and transition from traditional
   nutritious diets to dependence on less nutritious imported foods,
   undermining efforts to reduce hunger and promote nutrition.
   Undernutrition, in turn, weakens climate resilience and the coping
   strategies of vulnerable populations. Nutrition-sensitive adaptation and
   mitigation measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive
   agriculture development, improved maternal and child care and health,
   and both community development and food system resilience measures are
   proposed as means to address the impacts of climate change on food and
   nutrition security. Conclusion: Pacific Island countries should not face
   these challenges alone. Strengthened global, regional and community
   responses to organize better preparedness, adaptation and mitigation
   against climate change and its impact on nutrition in Pacific island
   countries is needed. Specific opportunities to address these issues in
   the Pacific will be presented.},

Abstract = {To promote the resilience and sustainability of coastal
   social-ecological systems (SES), it is necessary to implement adaptive
   and participatory management schemes. Successful examples of adaptation
   to the rapid change in coastal SES exist, but the question of whether
   these cases may be scalable to other regions and contexts remains. To
   this end, the present study aimed to identify how successful management
   strategies implemented in a fishing cooperative in Baja California,
   Mexico, can be adapted to other coastal SES. In particular, this study
   aimed to understand whether adaptive co-management of Isla Natividad
   (IN) could be replicated in Isla Todos Santos (ITS), a biophysically
   similar coastal SES to IN but with different results with regard to
   fisheries management. We found that the resource systems and resources
   in both SESs were similar. However, there were substantial differences
   with regard to governance and resource users. In Isla Natividad, the
   level of organization orchestrated by the resource users has contributed
   to establishing rules and sanctions that have supported the sustainable
   use of fishery resources. On the contrary, in ITS, the number of
   resource users and their socioeconomic attributes have impeded the
   establishment of effective rules or sanctions. The results of this study
   suggest that the ITS governance system needs to be improved in order to
   adapt some of the IN management strategies to increase its adaptive
   capacity. To promote successful adaptive management, it is necessary to
   develop context-specific adaptive pathways that contribute to greater
   resilience in the SESs of this region and in other regions that face
   similar conditions.},

Abstract = {The goals of the Climate Monitoring CubeSat Mission (CM2) are to
   accelerate climate projection by obtaining global temperature, tidal and
   wave measurements with a simple CubeSat-based imaging spectrograph; and
   to demonstrate how a high-resolution imaging spectrograph can be
   deployed on a CubeSat satellite. In the middle atmosphere (50 - 100 km),
   beyond the reach of balloons or satellites, thermal signatures of CO2
   radiation and wave activity have been largely missing from climate model
   inputs. This paper outlines an instrument to advance the state of the
   art in atmospheric climate projection by providing critical global
   measurements of middle-atmosphere temperatures and waves with a
   CubeSat-scale imaging spectrograph.
   The CM2 will remotely sense middle-atmosphere temperatures and waves at
   similar to 90 km by analyzing spectra of intrinsically bright molecular
   oxygen emissions at near-infrared wavelengths in the O2 atmospheric
   band. The core instrument will be a miniaturized imaging spectrograph
   based on a monolithic spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS). This
   spectrograph will have sensitivity and spectral resolution to extract
   temperatures with 10 degrees K precision and waves with 4 km scale
   resolution along a similar to 200 km cross-track swath. The SHS is
   significantly more robust than conventional interferometers, and thus
   better suited to space-based observation.
   Acquiring high-resolution middle-atmosphere temperature, tidal, and wave
   data on a daily, global basis will significantly improve climate models,
   and will help assess long-term greenhouse gas mitigation policy impact
   on upper-atmosphere thermal signatures. The CM2 program will also
   establish the efficacy of high-resolution CubeSat-based broadband
   (near-IR to UV) spectroscopy for application to other atmospheric
   research missions.},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change, such as increasing temperature, erratic
   rainfall pattern, sea level rise, etc., are being increasingly reported.
   These impacts are destructive for human activities and thus the
   development and improvement of mitigation and adaptation strategies is a
   priority globally. In the least developed and developing countries,
   adequate adaptive capacities are required so to boost the resilience of
   communities towards the projected climate change projected. Moreover,
   activities of climate change adaptation not only provide solutions and
   strategies to deal with climate change, but also encourage sustainable
   development. This comparative study evaluates projects in three
   countries: Mongolia, The Philippines, and Timor Leste, by mapping and
   contrasting the factors that contribute to adaptive capacity and support
   sustainable development. A heuristic matrix was used to articulate the
   capacities that influenced the desired outcomes of each project. Some
   key components of adaptive capacity were identified in each context. The
   interaction of those components improved the generic and specific
   capacity at individual and system level then ultimately improved
   resilience towards climate change.},

Title = {Understanding smallholder farmers' capacity to respond to climate change
   in a coastal community in Central Vietnam},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},

Pages = {701-716},
Abstract = {Climate change as expressed by erratic rainfall, increased flooding,
   extended droughts, frequency tropical cyclones or saline water
   intrusion, poses severe threats to smallholder farmers in Vietnam.
   Adaptation of the agricultural sector is vital to increase the
   resilience of smallholder farmers' livelihoods in times of climate
   change. To complement efforts already implemented by farmers to reduce
   social vulnerability it is important to understand how farmers perceive
   their current and future capacity to adapt to climate change. This paper
   aims to explore smallholder farmers' capacity to respond to climate
   change in current and future agricultural production. We carried out
   open, in-depth interviews (n=13), focus group discussions, and
   structured interviews (n=114) in the Thua Thien Hue province. Our
   findings show that farmers nowadays experience more extreme climate
   variability. Farmers report increasing stresses due to temperature
   increase and droughts. The autonomous adaptation strategies adopted by
   farmers include; adjusting the season calendar, using tolerant varieties
   and breeds, applying integrated crop production models, and income
   diversification. The motives for adopting particular planned adaptation
   options differ between farmers in crop production and livestock
   production. Four factors were found to be significant (p<.05) in
   influencing the spread of adaptation measures (AMs) farmers adopted:
   farm income, the number of available information sources, number of
   workers on the farm, and farmable land available during the summer
   season. Farmers report several barriers to implement adaptation
   strategies including; market price fluctuations, lack of skilled labour,
   lack of climate change information, and lack of capacity to learn and
   apply techniques in their daily practice. While both crop and livestock
   farmers participated in one or several training courses on climate
   change in the past years, livestock farmers were still uncertain about
   their future capacity and possible AMs.},

Abstract = {Resilient and sustainable development of urban areas under climate
   change requires strategies to compensate for the effects of the urban
   heat island (UHI). Currently, there are various urban heat island
   mitigation strategies (UHIMSs) used to alleviate the impact of the
   ever-rising temperatures. However, the effectiveness of such strategies
   should be assessed with respect to a multitude of parameters to ensure
   their resilience and sustainability. The review of the literature
   reveals there is lack of comprehensive models and clear performance
   measures that can aid practitioners in selecting the most appropriate
   mitigation method(s). This study presents a framework of a comprehensive
   model that incorporates the most common sustainable and resilience
   attributes and criteria. This work represents the skeleton needed to
   further develop an interactive computer-based decision support system
   (DS S) for selecting the most efficient UHEVIS with respect to the
   preset criteria based on the resilience and strategy of the UHEVIS

Abstract = {The impact of global warming is widespread, a number of factors have to
   be identified and analyzed. Causal factors include world population
   growth at present and growing exponentially. Increases of personal
   incomes and wealth have created more increased consumption of
   public/private housing transit and transportation which have in turn
   increased demand for raw materials, natural and mining resources such as
   gas, coal, oil sand and ocean oil/gas exploration.
   The melting of the North Pole's glaciers has affected the ocean levels
   flooding of river and creeks and as well affected agricultural
   production on a major scale.
   In order to have clean environment on earth, we need a flexible
   management to cope with global warming and its impact on our quality of
   life. An alternative to coal and fossil fuels which are directly causing
   climate change through heat-trapping gases that are warming the
   atmosphere must be technologically found and implemented as early as
   possible. A mix alternative and clean energy such as solar panels,
   hydro, wind-turbines and bio-mass energy system has to be developed and
   implemented. This requires a close cooperation among public
   institutions, private industry, technical experts, university
   researchers, financially and administratively, among all nations.
   Nuclear energy can be considered as an alternative clean energy and must
   be developed and also monitored for the safety.
   According to the world wildlife fund Canada released a list of the ten
   top Canadian cities in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions,
   municipal targets, green building codes and green transportation,
   Vancouver ranked first, with a score of 8.1 out of ten, followed by
   Toronto (7.2) and Montreal (6.2). Vancouver has reduced emission to 1990
   is the only Municipality on track to meet Kyoto and has the greenest
   building code in Canada.
   Some of the important Green Energy Strategy and Development in Canada
   have been designed and implemented by various Provinces listed as
   follows:
   B.C. established the BC forest and range practices act (BCFRPA) which
   was one of the first in North America requiring tenure holders to pursue
   sustainable forest management planning and to provide measurable
   results.
   Ontario Provincial Government passed a new green act to explore solar,
   wind, water and biomass new technological energy. The world's biggest
   solar farms as an example, is in Enbridge's 80-megawatt power project on
   380 hectares near Sarnia, Ontario. The goal is to make solar cells more
   efficient. Electrovaya Inc. of Mississauga, Ontario has developed and
   advanced enough to get electric cars such as ChevyVolt onto the market.
   Society on Earth must think about energy and be conscious of its use.
   People must understand that what they can do to conserve energy will
   have cumulative effect. Also, people need to act on their
   responsibility. And finally, it needs the participation of everyone, not
   just power plants, equipment manufacturers or public/private
   institutions. All society needs to take responsibility to be involved
   pulling together, all the time.},

Abstract = {Climate change-induced sea-level rise will result in the partial or
   complete inundation of low-lying coastal areas and insular features. The
   consequences of this include the loss of baselines from which maritime

   questions, in particular concerning the legal status of maritime
   entitlements and in some cases the potential loss of statehood.
   Solutions proposed include maintaining existing baselines or outer
   limits of maritime zones, or the construction de novo of artificial
   islands. This article examines the current state of international law
   under the international climate-change regime and the law of the sea in
   relation to adaptation and adaptive measures, such as maintaining of
   baselines, island fortification and the construction of artificial
   islands. In addition, the article explores the question as to whether
   measures such as maintaining baselines would constitute adaptive
   measures under the existing climate-change regime.},

Title = {Analysis of multiple drivers of air pollution emissions in China via
   interregional trade},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {244},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Severe haze problems in China have attracted substantial attention.
   End-of-pipe measures have been implemented to mitigate air pollutant
   emissions in different industrial sectors. However, interregional trade
   can lead to geological separation of the stages of supply chains (i.e.,
   primary input, production, final sale and consumption), and thus,
   emissions can be driven by cross-regional drivers (i.e., primary inputs,
   final sales and consumption), and pollutants can transfer among regions
   via supply chains. Inequity exists in production-side measures of
   emission reductions, which do not account for the effects of
   cross-regional drivers. In this study, we use a multiregional
   input-output model in the year 2012 to calculate the emissions driven by
   cross-regional drivers and to trace emission flows along supply chains
   in China, aiming to inform policymaking on fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) mitigation and to provide additional information about shared
   responsibilities among provinces. We find that the Central (including
   Anhui and Henan) is the largest emitter outside the Central Coast in
   order to meet the demand for sales within the Central Coast.
   Specifically, the cross-provincial sale of products from the
   construction sector drives massive emissions, especially in Jiangsu
   province (located in the Central Coast). Therefore, the Central Coast
   should bear some responsibility to help provinces located in the Central
   reduce emissions. About half of emissions driven by primary inputs in
   Beijing-Tianjin are emitted in other regions. However, in general,
   emissions (except for ammonia) are more likely to be driven by final
   sales of other provinces than by primary inputs. The supply chain
   perspective can help gain a better understanding of the impacts of
   trade-related drivers on emission patterns and advocate just and
   effective policies considering cleaner production and shared
   responsibilities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   - the light to life, housing, water and sanitation, food, health,
   development, security of persons and an adequate standard of living.
   Industry and business play a crucial role with regard to climate change,
   accounting for approximately one-third of the world's energy consumption
   and 36 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, industry and the
   global business community have a responsibility to join national and
   international efforts to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. Across
   Asia, Europe, Africa, and North and South America, the adverse effects
   of climate change have manifested over the years as ozone layer
   depletion, continental global warming, a shower of acid rain, extended
   fires, melting ice, rise in sea level and other extreme events which
   call for urgent action at national and international levels.
   A self-regulating approach that makes manufacturing organisations
   socially responsible and responsive to environmental issues in their
   operating countries can be pragmatic in climate-change mitigation, and
   strengthen existing governmental policies on climate change. A number of
   affirmative actions and recommendations has been formulated at national
   and international levels to regulate climate change including
   eco-vigilance. adoption of green, conservation of the flora and fauna,
   zero-tolerance of gas flaring, socially responsible investment, carbon
   emission reporting and disclosures and adoption of environment-friendly
   manufacturing techniques. Therefore, the present study not only focusses
   on the theoretical aspect but also on the socio-legal aspect filling the
   gap in both theory and practice related to the impact of Corporate
   Social Responsibility on society.},

Title = {Resilient flood risk strategies: institutional preconditions for
   implementation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {There is a growing recognition of resilience enhancement as an
   additional objective for adaptation. This will typically involve
   enhancing the preparedness and capacity to respond to the impacts of
   climate change. Within flood risk practice, resilient strategies focus
   on reducing impacts from flooding through better prevention and
   preparedness. Such strategies will not only reduce existing risk levels,
   but could also make the social-ecological system more robust for extreme
   flood events. This is because they seek to prevent those impacts on the
   system from which recovery is extremely difficult without outside help.
   Besides that, resilient strategies increase the prospect for the
   realization of cobenefits, particularly when measures are selected
   within the spatial domain. Implementing resilient strategies, however,
   faces many difficulties, particularly in countries like the Netherlands
   and Poland where prevalent governance arrangements are aimed to
   facilitate resistant strategies, focusing exclusively on flood
   protection. We analyzed these implementation difficulties for the Island
   of Dordrecht, which is a front-runner case of resilient flood risk
   governance in the Netherlands. A theoretical framework based on relevant
   issues regarding governance arrangements was used to reflect on the
   identified gaps and barriers. Although all issues played a role in the
   case study, there seem to be no generic institutional design parameters
   that have to be applied for implementing resilient strategies. Even in
   the current institutional regime, it is possible to find ways of
   implementing a resilient strategy. The more general institutional
   precondition has to do with the political willingness to allow for
   collaboration and experimentation and to enable a more flexible use of
   current principles and rules.},

Title = {Cost-effectiveness analysis of energy efficiency measures for maritime
   shipping using a metamodel based approach with different data sources},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {189},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {A large number of mitigation strategies including both technical and
   operational measures have been proposed to reduce ship energy
   consumption and hence carbon emissions. Under cost and other practical
   constraints, when prioritizing among mitigation measures, different data
   sources such as observed data from physical systems and simulated data
   from simulation models may be used. Data obtained from different sources
   have different characteristics in terms of accuracy and data volume.
   Therefore, it is important to integrate different data sources when
   evaluating alternative mitigation measures in a systematic and systemic
   manner. In response, a Gaussian process metamodel based method is
   proposed to evaluate energy saving measures when different data sources
   are combined synergistically. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis
   is used to prioritize the mitigation strategies based on cost
   considerations. A case study is developed to demonstrate the advantages
   of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and efficiency. All
   mitigation measures selected in the case study are found to have a
   negative cost which can translate to both energy and cost savings. Among
   the evaluated measures, speed reduction has shown to be the most
   plausible measure in terms of energy savings and marginal
   cost-effectiveness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Future climate change is predicted to shift long-term persistence zones
   in the cold-temperate kelp Laminaria hyperborea},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {174-182},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global climate change is shifting species distributions worldwide. At
   rear edges (warmer, low latitude range margins), the consequences of
   small variations in environmental conditions can be magnified, producing
   large negative effects on species ranges. A major outcome of shifts in
   distributions that only recently received attention is the potential to
   reduce the levels of intra-specific diversity and consequently the
   global evolutionary and adaptive capacity of species to face novel
   disturbances. This is particularly important for low dispersal marine
   species, such as kelps, that generally retain high and unique genetic
   diversity at rear ranges resulting from long-term persistence, while
   ranges shifts during climatic glacial/interglacial cycles. Using
   ecological niche modelling, we (1) infer the major environmental forces
   shaping the distribution of a cold-temperate kelp, Laminaria hyperborea
   (Gunnerus) Foslie, and we (2) predict the effect of past climate changes
   in shaping regions of long-term persistence (i.e., climatic refugia),
   where this species might hypothetically harbour higher genetic diversity
   given the absence of bottlenecks and local extinctions over the long
   term. We further (3) assessed the consequences of future climate for the
   fate of L. hyperborea using different scenarios of greenhouse gas
   emissions (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). Results show NW Iberia, SW Ireland and
   W English Channel, Faroe Islands and S Iceland, as regions where L.
   hyperborea may have persisted during past climate extremes until present
   day. All predictions for the future showed expansions to northern
   territories coupled with the significant loss of suitable habitats at
   low latitude range margins, where long-term persistence was inferred
   (e.g., NW Iberia). This pattern was particularly evident in the most
   agressive scenario of climate change (RCP 8.5), likely driving major
   biodiversity loss, changes in ecosystem functioning and the
   impoverishment of the global gene pool of L. hyperborea. Because no
   genetic baseline is currently available for this species, our results
   may represent a first step in informing conservation and mitigation
   strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The UK government has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions by 80\%, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Decarbonisation of
   transport and heat supply to buildings is recognised as a fundamental
   step in achieving this target. With cities being the largest producers
   of GHG emissions they provide the biggest opportunity for climate change
   mitigation.
   Two contrasting visions of a 2050 target-compliant scenario are
   evaluated against each other. One is based on a high penetration of
   nuclear power and renewables the other based on predominantly gas with
   carbon capture storage (CCS). An impact assessment is carried out on
   both scenarios to understand how each scenario might perform over 4
   evaluation criteria.
   The evaluation criteria provide insight into each scenario regarding;
   guaranteeing security of supply, scenario cost, sustainability and how
   feasible it is to deploy the chosen technologies. Whilst both scenarios
   raise discussion points on the feasibility of deploying certain
   technologies the more favourable scenario, in terms of the study
   results, is the nuclear and renewables option. The renewable energy
   generating technologies included as part of the study from largest to
   smallest in terms of capacity - are wind, solar photovoltaic, tidal and
   river hydro. The outputs of this study provide an important contribution
   to academic debate on what might be the most effective approach to
   achieving the 2050 decarbonisation target. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We investigated the effect of artificial marine cloud brightening on
   extreme temperatures over East Asia. We used simulation data from five
   global climate models which have conducted the GeoMIP G4cdnc experiment.
   G4cdnc was designed to simulate an increase in the cloud droplet number
   concentration of the global marine lower clouds by 50\% under the
   greenhouse gas forcing of the RCP4.5 scenario. G4cdnc decreased the net
   radiative forcing in the top of the atmosphere more over the ocean,
   alleviating the rise in mean temperature under RCP4.5 forcing. For
   extreme temperatures, G4cdnc reduced both the monthly minimum of daily
   minimum temperature (TNn) and monthly maximum of daily maximum
   temperature (TXx). The response of TNn was higher than that of TXx,
   especially in the winter, over the Sea of Okhotsk and the interior of
   the continent. This spatial heterogeneity and seasonality of the
   response were associated with sea ice-albedo and snow-albedo feedbacks.
   We also calculated the efficacy of warming mitigation as a measure of
   the relative effect of geoengineering. The efficacy for TXx was higher
   than that for TNn, opposite to the absolute effect. After the
   termination of geoengineering, both TNn and TXx tended to rapidly revert
   to their trend under the RCP4.5 forcing.},

Title = {Will cool roofs improve the thermal performance of our built

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {324-337},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {A number of international campaigns have recently proposed the use of
   cool roofs worldwide in order to cope with the summer urban heat island
   (UHI) effect. This work investigates cool roof strategy and examines the
   potential of such a strategy for Bahrain. Full-scale measurement,
   meteorological modelling and thermal simulation of five standard roofs
   were performed during particular summer days due to the high intensity
   levels of solar irradiation. This work shows that the light tile roof
   and metal decking are relatively cooler and more comfortable than others
   and that the maximum reduction in heat gain occurs for a light tile roof
   with thermal insulation materials. Nevertheless, without insulation the
   cooling load is increased by only 1.3\%. This percentage seems not to be
   cost-effective where economics and building construction are concerned.
   In contrast, the reduction percentage due to the use of thermal
   insulation in the case of dark tile roof, felt bitumen roof and screed
   roof increases to 5-7\%, which is more cost effective. This work
   concludes that the cool roof strategy is the most cost-effective for the
   hot climate of Bahrain, which has a long cooling season. With the
   current levels of urban development in Bahrain, cool roofs can reduce
   UHI intensity and building cooling loads, lowering demand for
   electricity and greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. To avoid any
   negative consequences from using this strategy, however, trade-offs
   between urban mitigation and adoptation strategies and complementary
   technologies should be accounted for in future urban development plans.

Title = {Tourism and climate change - A discussion of suitable strategies for
   Austria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND
   MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Tourism is both a major contributor to climate change and also one of
   the sectors more heavily impacted. Developing and implementing
   adaptation and mitigation measures are of particular importance, as the
   extent of climate risks in the second half of the century can still be
   significantly influenced by effective global actions.
   This paper is based on an in-depth report on tourism and climate change
   for the tourism destination of Austria, summarizing the current
   scientific knowledge and a related stakeholder discussion. Against this
   background, the paper at hand discusses possible fields of action,
   examples of suitable measures, and related challenges. It shows how to
   distinguish different levels of action and develop related adaptation
   strategies for the traveler (consumer adaptation), the tourist operation
   (business adaptation), the regional destination (destination adaptation)
   and the destination of Austria (national destination policy and
   adaptation).
   However, the discussion also shows that current incremental progress may
   be - despite its many successes - too slow for the challenging task. The
   experiences around Covid-19 have shown that normative instruments do
   have the power to affect significant trend reversals, including a change
   in lifestyle. The wealth of adaptation measures presented in this paper
   should be incorporated into a vision such as the climate friendly
   ``Paris-Lifestyle{''} - a tangible change and a common societal task.
   Management implications: The effects of climate change can still be
   influenced to avoid significant effects in the second half of the
   century. However, this requires a focus on normative measures on the
   national and European level. The compilation of methodological
   approaches shows that, in addition to a strong normative approach, a
   combination of economic, behavioral economic planning and moderating
   methods can also be used. In the area of behavioral economics and
   nudging in particular, the existing options have hardly ever been
   applied. For managers in tourism businesses, this is where the greatest
   potential is seen.},

Title = {When can decision analysis improve climate adaptation planning? Two

Abstract = {Climate adaptation decisions are difficult because the future climate is
   deeply uncertain. Combined with uncertainties concerning the cost,
   lifetime, and effectiveness of adaptation measures, this implies that
   the net benefits of alternative adaptation strategies are ambiguous. On
   one hand, a simple analysis that disregards uncertainty might lead to
   near-term choices that are later regretted if future circumstances
   differ from those assumed. On the other hand, careful uncertainty-based
   decision analyses can be costly in personnel and time and might not make
   a difference. This paper considers two questions adaptation managers
   might ask. First, what type of analysis is most appropriate for a
   particular adaptation decision? We answer this question by proposing a
   six-step screening procedure to compare the usefulness of
   predict-then-act analysis, multi-scenario analysis without adaptive
   options, and multi-scenario analysis incorporating adaptive options. A
   tutorial application is presented using decision trees. However, this
   procedure may be cumbersome if managers face several adaptation problems
   simultaneously. Hence, a second question is how can managers quickly
   identify problems that would benefit most from thorough decision
   analysis? To address this question, we propose a procedure that ranks
   multiple adaptation problems in terms of the necessity and value of
   comprehensive analysis. Analysis can then emphasize the highest-ranking
   problems. This procedure is illustrated by a ranking of adaptation
   problems in the Chesapeake Bay region. The two complementary procedures
   proposed here can help managers focus analytical efforts where they will
   be most useful.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},

Volume = {7},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Most adaptation studies suggest that sea-level rise will lead to
   relocation as flooding worsens. Here we identified and evaluated
   potential adaptation strategies for adapting to sea-level rise, based on
   the experiences of four low-lying island communities in central
   Philippines that have experienced flooding during normal high tides
   since a 2013 earthquake that induced land subsidence. Coastal surveys,
   interviews and household questionnaires showed that island residents
   generally prefer in situ adaptation strategies rather than relocation to
   the mainland. These results are unexpected, particularly because a
   relocation programme has been developed by authorities on the mainland.
   Direct measurements during a flooding event indicate stilted housing as
   the most effective type of adaptation strategy. Many households have
   also raised their floors using coral stones, although this might
   inadvertently increase their vulnerability to typhoons and storm surges
   in the long-term.},

Title = {Evolving Understanding of Antarctic Ice-Sheet Physics and Ambiguity in

Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},

Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1217-1233},

Abstract = {Mechanisms such as ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse may
   rapidly increase discharge from marine-based ice sheets. Here, we link a
   probabilistic framework for sea-level projections to a small ensemble of
   Antarctic ice-sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical
   processes to explore their influence on global-mean sea-level (GMSL) and
   relative sea-level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results
   using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS
   changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative
   Concentration Pathway {[}RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL
   rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised
   median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153
   million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model,
   rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of
   ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central
   90\% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93-243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26-98
   cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP
   8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5
   jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million
   for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to
   GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea-level
   observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of
   post-2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need
   for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.},

Title = {Constraining Uncertainties in CMIP5 Projections of September Arctic Sea
   Ice Extent with Observations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In agreement with observations, Earth system models participating in
   phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulate a
   decline in September Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) over the past decades.
   However, the spread in their twenty-first-century SIE projections is
   large and the timing of the first ice-free Arctic summer ranges from
   2020 to beyond 2100. The uncertainties arise from three sources
   (internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty),
   which are quantified in this study for projections of SIE. The goal is
   to narrow uncertainties by applying multiple diagnostic ensemble
   regression (MDER). MDER links future projections of sea ice extent to
   processes relevant to its simulation under present-day conditions using
   data covering the past 40 years. With this method, we can reduce model
   uncertainty in projections of SIE for the period 2020-44 by 30\%-50\%
   (0.8-1.3 million km(2)). Compared to the unweighted multimodel mean, the
   MDER-weighted mean projects an about 20\% smaller SIE and an earlier
   near-disappearance of Arctic sea ice by more than a decade for a
   high-greenhouse gas scenario. We also show that two different methods
   estimating internal variability in SIE differ by 1 million km(2).
   Regardless, the total uncertainties in the SIE projections remain large
   (up to 3.5 million km(2), with irreducible internal variability
   contributing 30\%) so that a precise time estimate of an ice-free Arctic
   proves impossible. We conclude that unweighted CMIP5 multimodel-mean
   projections of Arctic SIE are too optimistic and mitigation strategies
   to reduce Arctic warming need to be intensified.},

Title = {Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Strategies for the Impact of
   Climate Change on Agricultural Land in Southern Taiwan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Maintaining a certain amount of agricultural land and promoting its
   agricultural land utilization efficiency is essential in a country. Many
   innovative strategies for adapting to climate change have been
   implemented in developed countries. To achieve the goal of climate
   change adaptation for agricultural land, a vulnerability assessment of
   farmland is indispensable. Based on the research framework of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this study applied the
   structure of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation to build criteria and
   conduct an evaluation of a designated area in Southern Taiwan. We
   identified the key factors of the vulnerability of farmland, through
   mapping with spatial analysis, and by using geographic information
   system tools. The main purpose of the application of a vulnerability
   assessment is not to explicitly describe the status of agricultural land
   to climate change, but to help local government and farmers to identify
   the critical area, and to discuss the appropriated adaptive policies.
   According to the results of the vulnerability assessment of agricultural
   land, the entire study region can be divided into three patterns:
   Pattern 1, located in the western coastal zone, filled with various
   attributes of high vulnerability; Pattern 2, distributed on the central
   plain region in the east, with complete blocks of agricultural land and
   low vulnerability; and Pattern 3, located in the central plain region to
   the west, a region in which areas with various vulnerability levels. The
   following three types of adaptation strategies for climate change for
   farmland were established: (1) the enhancement of agricultural
   production, (2) the maintenance of agricultural production, and (3) the
   conservation of the agricultural environment. The current results can
   serve as valuable guidelines for governments to implement feasible local
   adaptation strategies in the future.},

Title = {Assessing the impacts of 1.5 degrees C global warming - simulation

Abstract = {In Paris, France, December 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to
   the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
   invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide
   a ``special report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5
   degrees C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas
   emission pathways{''}. In Nairobi, Kenya, April 2016, the IPCC panel
   accepted the invitation. Here we describe the response devised within
   the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) to
   provide tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impact projections to
   broaden the scientific basis for the report. The simulation protocol is
   designed to allow for (1) separation of the impacts of historical
   warming starting from pre-industrial conditions from impacts of other
   drivers such as historical land-use changes (based on pre-industrial and
   historical impact model simulations); (2) quantification of the impacts
   of additional warming up to 1.5 degrees C, including a potential
   overshoot and longterm impacts up to 2299, and comparison to higher
   levels of global mean temperature change (based on the lowemissions
   Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6 and a no-mitigation pathway
   RCP6.0) with socio-economic conditions fixed at 2005 levels; and (3)
   assessment of the climate effects based on the same climate scenarios
   while accounting for simultaneous changes in socio-economic conditions
   following the middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2,
   Fricko et al., 2016) and in particular differential bioenergy
   requirements associated with the transformation of the energy system to
   comply with RCP2.6 compared to RCP6.0. With the aim of providing the
   scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and
   analysis of cross-sectoral interactions that may dampen or amplify
   sectoral impacts, the protocol is designed to facilitate consistent
   impact projections from a range of impact models across different
   sectors (global and regional hydrology, lakes, global crops, global
   vegetation, regional forests, global and regional marine ecosystems and
   fisheries, global and regional coastal infrastructure, energy supply and
   demand, temperature-related mortality, and global terrestrial
   biodiversity).},

Abstract = {The cruise tourism industry in Arctic Canada has recently grown rapidly
   with stable numbers now emerging. While there are many socio-economic
   opportunities associated with growth, climate change, and environmental,
   technical and cultural risks also present significant management
   challenges. To enhance understanding of these opportunities and risks,
   this study adopted a policy Delphi approach to identify and evaluate
   potential adaptation strategies to aid decision-makers and policy-makers
   managing cruise tourism development and its associated impacts. Over 500
   ideas were identified. These were distilled down to 65 potential
   adaptation options, which were evaluated for priority and feasibility by
   key stakeholders including local residents, tourism operators, and
   policy-makers. The majority of recommendations were evaluated as of high
   priority and most options were perceived to be somewhat affordable and
   implementable. Key needs included disaster management plans, updated
   technology and ship navigation systems, improved marine resource
   mapping, and the development of a code of conduct for cruise tourists to
   guide visitor behaviour and promote a sustainable approach. The research
   represents the first empirical study to identify and evaluate adaptation
   strategies for cruise tourism development in Arctic Canada and outlines
   current priorities, opportunities, and challenges associated with
   managing socio-economic change in Arctic Canada in sustainable ways.},

Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {This paper explores the perceived adaptation preference of rural island
   communities in addressing future climate change risks, particularly
   those concerning sea-level rise. The research explores the role of
   culture and local politics, and differences among various age and gender
   groups within the community regarding preferred adaptation pathways for
   coping with the impacts of future sea-level rise. A participatory action
   approach, in the form of a community workshop, was employed, which
   separated participants into community identified groupings. Differences
   in community groups' adaptation preferences emerged, though the range of
   adaptation measures considered were limited, probably due to the
   participants' limited exposure to adaptation mechanisms in their
   immediate surroundings. Overall, the communities surveyed tended to be
   conservative, especially in their attitudes towards western adaptation
   solutions developed in non-island contexts.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impacts of increased salinity on agricultural
   productivity and groundwater use for irrigation with the aim to cope
   with overexploitation associated with potential climate change impacts.
   For this purpose, a farmers' field survey was conducted at a pilot plain
   with banana plantations partially irrigated with saline groundwater. The
   economic burden of increased salinity was examined using a crop-water
   production function relating water salinity and yield with production
   cost and selling prices. Current production rates in low salinity plots
   were greater than those in high salinity plots by an average of 25\%,
   representing the salinity burden incurred by farmers. We close with
   highlighting mitigation measures and adaptation strategies under
   potential future climatic changes that are expected to exacerbate
   irrigation with high salinity groundwater.},

Title = {Seaweed's Role in Energetic Transition-From Environmental Pollution
   Challenges to Enhanced Electrochemical Devices},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Earth is currently facing the effects of climate change
   in all environmental ecosystems; this, together with pollution, is the
   cause of species extinction and biodiversity loss. Thus, it is vital to
   take actions to mitigate and decrease the release of greenhouse gases to
   the atmosphere. The emergence of energetic transition from fossil fuels
   to greener energies is clearly defined in the United Nations 2030
   agenda. Although this transition endorses the ambitious goal to supply
   greener energy for all developed societies, the increased demand for the
   minerals essential to develop cleaner energetic technologies has
   highlighted several economic and environmental issues. Currently, these
   minerals are mainly obtained by mining activities that generate high
   levels of soil and water pollution, coupled with the intensive use of
   water and hazardous gas release. On the other hand, the exponential
   increase of electronic waste derived from end-of-life electronic
   equipment is already raising environmental concerns due to heavy metal
   contamination as a result of their disposal. Thus, it is vital to
   develop sustainable and efficient strategies to mitigate energetic
   transition environmental footprints. This review highlights the use of
   seaweed biomass for toxic mineral bioremediation, recycling, and as an
   alternative material for greener energy-storage device development.
   Resulting from the growing human population and the long dependency on
   fossil-based energies, the planet is facing a critical rise in global
   temperature, which is affecting all ecosystem networks. With a growing
   consciousness this issue, the EU has defined several strategies towards
   environment sustainability, where biodiversity restoration and
   preservation, pollution reduction, circular economy, and energetic
   transition are paramount issues. To achieve the ambitious goal of
   becoming climate-neutral by 2050, it is vital to mitigate the
   environmental footprint of the energetic transition, namely heavy metal
   pollution resulting from mining and processing of raw materials and from
   electronic waste disposal. Additionally, it is vital to find alternative
   materials to enhance the efficiency of energy storage devices. This
   review addresses the environmental challenges associated with energetic
   transition, with particular emphasis on the emergence of new alternative
   materials for the development of cleaner energy technologies and on the
   environmental impacts of mitigation strategies. We compile the most
   recent advances on natural sources, particularly seaweed, with regard to
   their use in metal recycling, bioremediation, and as valuable biomass to
   produce biochar for electrochemical applications.},

Title = {Unpacking multilevel adaptation to climate change in the Great Barrier
   Reef, Australia},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {800-812},

Abstract = {Multilevel governance is regarded as a promising approach to deal with
   the multidimensional nature of climate change adaptation. However, the
   policy context in which it is implemented is very often complex and
   fragmented, characterised by interacting climate and non-climate
   strategies. An understanding of multilevel decision-making and
   governance is particularly important, if desired adaptation outcomes are
   to be achieved. This paper examines how climate change adaptation takes
   place in a complex multilevel system of governance, in the context of
   Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region. It examines over one
   hundred adaptation strategies at federal, state, regional and local
   levels in terms of type, manifestation, purposefulness, drivers and
   triggers, and geographic and temporal scope. Interactions between
   strategies are investigated both at the same level of governance and
   across governance levels. This study demonstrates that multilevel
   approach is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition in responding to
   complex multiscale and multisector issues, such as climate change
   adaptation. Short-term adaptation measures; a predominant incremental,
   sectoral, top-down approach to adaptation; and the lack of a framework
   for managing interactions are major threats to effective climate
   adaptation in the GBR region. Coping with such threats will require
   long-term transformative action, establishing enabling conditions to
   support local adaptation, and, most important, creating and maintaining
   strategic interactions among adaptation strategies. Coordinating and
   integrating climate and non-climate strategies across jurisdictions and
   policy sectors are the most significant and challenging tasks for
   multilevel governance in the GBR region and elsewhere. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {427-444},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal zones are vital to small islands due to limited land
   availability and ocean exposure. Their significance and resident
   dependence result in a need to address unique small island coastal zone
   concerns. Recent population concentrations and increased economic
   activity along with accompanying lucrative coastal development are
   posing significant threats to human and natural system well-being.
   Potential environmental hazards therefore play an important role in
   coastal vulnerability and risk assessment, and it is only by
   understanding causes and consequences that policy makers, along with
   scientists and the public, can establish appropriate mitigation
   measures. This paper addresses the lack of specific small island
   studies, including their unique circumstances. Coastal hazards are
   assessed and effective mitigation strategies suggested. A case study of
   the Azores archipelago highlights specific coastal hazards and
   demonstrates the importance of public participation when implementing
   mitigation measures. Furthermore, the inclusion of an external neutral
   and unbiased coastal management expert within the public participation
   process facilitated successful development of Azorean Coastal Zone
   Management Plans.},

Title = {Responding to Climate Change: Participatory Evaluation of Adaptation
   Options for Key Marine Fisheries in Australia's South East},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 6},
Abstract = {Planned adaptation to climate impacts and subsequent vulnerabilities
   will necessarily interact with autonomous responses enabled within
   existing fisheries management processes and initiated by the harvest and
   post-harvest components of fishing industries. Optimal adaptation
   options are those which enable negative effects to be mitigated and
   opportunities that arise to be maximized, both in relation to specific
   climate-driven changes and the broader fisheries system. We developed a
   two-step participatory approach to evaluating adaption options for key
   fisheries in the fast-warming hotspot of south-eastern Australia. Four
   fisheries (southern rock lobster, abalone, snapper, and blue grenadier)
   were selected as case studies on the basis of their high to moderate
   vulnerability to climatic effects on species distribution and abundance.
   Involved stakeholders undertook a ``first pass{''} screening assessment
   of options, by characterizing and then evaluating options. In the
   characterization step potential adaptation options for each fishery,
   contextualized by prior knowledge of each species' climate change
   exposure and sensitivity, were described using a characterization
   matrix. This matrix included: the specific climate
   vulnerability/challenges, the implications of each option on the fishery
   system as a whole, the temporal and spatial scales of implementation
   processes, and realized benefits and costs. In the evaluation step,
   semi-quantitative evaluation of options was undertaken by stakeholders
   scoring the anticipated performance of an option against a
   pre-determined set of criteria relating to perceived feasibility, risk
   (inclusive of potential costs), and benefit. Reduction of the total
   annual commercial catch as well as reductions in both effort and catch
   through spatial and temporal closures were the options scored as having
   the highest level of expected benefit and of feasibility and the lowest
   level of risk of negative outcomes overall. Our screening assessment
   represents a pragmatic approach to evaluate and compare support for and
   the effects of alternative adaptation options prior to committing to
   more detailed formal and resource intensive evaluation or
   implementation.},

Title = {Stabilization of atmospheric carbon dioxide via zero emissions-An

Abstract = {The concept of ``stabilization{''} of atmospheric CO2 concentration is
   re-examined in connection with climate-change mitigation strategies. A
   new ``zero-emissions stabilization (Z-stabilization){''} is proposed,
   where CO2 emissions are reduced to zero at some time and thereafter the
   concentration is decreased by natural removal processes, eventually
   reaching an equilibrated stable state. Simplified climate experiments
   show that, under Z-stabilization, considerably larger emissions are
   permissible in the near future compared with traditional stabilization,
   with the same constraint on temperature rise. Over longer time scales,
   the concentration and temperature decrease close to their equilibrium
   values, much lower than those under traditional stabilization. The
   smaller temperature rise at final state is essential to avoid
   longer-term risk of sea level rise, a significant concern under
   traditional stabilization. Because of these advantages a Z-stabilization
   pathway can be a candidate of practical mitigation strategies as treated
   in Part 2.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Extreme uneven spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall pose the
   risk of water shortage to the industries in Taiwan, particularly during
   dry seasons, which may be worsen under climate change. This study aims
   to develop adaptation actions for an industrial company to reduce the
   risk of droughts. The Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) in Chuoshui
   River watershed is selected as a study case and an integrated risk
   assessment tool of water resources TaiWAP is used. The water shortage of
   FPC is mainly in the dry seasons because the water rights of public and
   agricultural uses are prioritized over industrial use. The considered
   adaptation options including water reuse, a desalination plant, smart
   agricultural water management, and rainwater harvesting. The results
   show that the waste-water reuse and sea-water desalination are the most
   effective adaptation options, which reduces the water shortage risks
   33-44\% per day in the return period of ten years. The results are
   generalized for the reference of other studies. The risk assessment and
   adaptation measure identification of the company require regional
   information. Moreover, some adaptation measures that the company
   implements help reduce the water shortage of the region and are
   consequently beneficial to the company, e.g., smart agricultural water
   management.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {256-275},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {International policy development and expected climate change impacts
   such as flooding, landslides, and the extinction of sensitive species
   have forced countries around the Baltic Sea to begin working on national
   climate adaptation policies. Simultaneously, the EU is building both a
   central and a macro-regional Baltic Sea-wide adaptation strategy to
   support national policy developments. However, it yet remains unclear
   how these EU strategies will complement each other or national policies.
   This article analyzes the constraints and opportunities presented by
   this new institutional interplay and discusses the potential of the
   forthcoming EU strategies to support national policy. It does so by
   mapping how adaptation is institutionalized in two case countries,
   Sweden and Finland, and is organized in the two EU approaches. The
   vertical institutional interplay between scales is analyzed in terms of
   three factors: competence, capacity, and compatibility. Results indicate
   institutional constraints related to: risks of policy complexity for
   subnational actors, an unclear relationship between the two EU
   approaches, an overly general approach to targeting contextualized
   climate change vulnerabilities, and a general lack of strategies to
   steer adaptation. However, there are also opportunities linked to an
   anticipated increased commitment to the national management of
   adaptation, especially related to biodiversity issues.},

Abstract = {Climate change and sea level rise present significant risks to coastal

   literatures to develop an adaptive risk management framework. Heeding
   the call for research of coastal county actions to plan for and respond
   to climate change, we conduct content analysis of planning documents,
   financial reports, meeting minutes, media reports, and other
   documentation of all coastal counties in Florida to quantify government
   efforts to address climate change. Risk management practices are
   hierarchically categorized by focus area, risk type, and tactic and
   placed within the adaptive risk management process framework. A
   well-functioning adaptive risk management process can redefine vague
   climate change risks into knowable, tractable problems to address.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {44-51},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change, owing to their potentially vast reach and
   scale, embody a critical challenge for fisheries management
   organizations. We conduct a systematic literature review to present an
   overview of how the peer-reviewed academic literature recommends
   fisheries management frameworks should respond to the climate
   change-driven uncertainty, vulnerability and risk facing resource bases.
   Our review identifies 21 different potential management responses.
   Adaptive management was the most commonly identified strategy, with
   institutional capacity development and input/output controls also
   frequently cited. We contrast our findings with illustrative cases
   characterizing management practice and outcomes in RFMOs, and argue that
   the ability of RFMOs to implement the climate change mitigation
   strategies identified in our review is a function of an organization's
   decision-making rules. We argue that consensus-based decision-making
   policies limit adaptiveness, and that a `responsiveness gap' exists
   between consensus and majority-based decision-making frameworks. This
   gap will become more evident, and increase in importance, as the impacts
   of climate change shift from potential to kinetic. Considering that
   decision-making rules in RFMOs are unlikely to change, we argue that
   increased analytical effort concentrated on institutional contexts and
   member state interest complexes may promote adaptive management,
   expediting the pace at which scientific recommendations and findings
   inform policy and practise in RFMOs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {The Costing of Measures for Natural Hazard Mitigation in Europe},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The literature on the costing of mitigation measures for reducing
   impacts of natural hazards is rather fragmented. This paper provides a
   concise overview of the current state of knowledge in Europe on the
   costing of mitigation measures for the reduction of natural hazard risks
   (droughts, floods, storms and induced coastal hazards as well as alpine
   hazards) and identifies knowledge gaps and related research
   recommendations. Furthermore, it provides a taxonomy of related
   mitigation options, classifying them into nine categories: (1)
   management plans, land-use planning, and climate adaptation; (2) hazard
   modification; (3) infrastructure; (4) mitigation measures (stricto
   sensu); (5) communication in advance of events; (6) monitoring and early
   warning systems; (7) emergency response and evacuation; (8) financial
   incentives; and (9) risk transfer (including insurance). It is found
   that the costing of mitigation measures in European and in other
   countries has almost exclusively focused on estimating direct costs. A
   cost assessment framework that addresses a range of costs, possibly
   informed by multiple stakeholders, would provide more accurate estimates
   and could provide better guidance to decision makers. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {Climate change affects the vulnerability and productivity of forestry
   and agricultural systems, predominantly by changes in precipitation and
   temperature patterns. Indirect impacts are altered risk of damage, for
   example, by longer periods of drought stress and other biotic and
   abiotic disturbances. While southern and eastern parts of the Baltic Sea
   basin are likely to experience a net impact of climate change that is
   negative for production, northern and western regions are likely to
   experience a general increase in production. As a result, land-use
   potentials will change and will foster adaptation and mitigation
   measures. In the northern region, forest management adaptation may lead
   to substantial yield increases, while in the south management,
   adaptation may be required to counter deteriorating conditions.
   Comparable conclusions can be drawn for agricultural management: if
   adaptation potentials are fully exploited, substantial yield increases
   can be expected for certain crop species. In the southern areas and for
   certain species, deteriorating conditions and possibly increasing
   climatic variability are projected. Both climate change impacts and
   human responses will affect socio-economic conditions in the Baltic Sea
   basin.},

Abstract = {Studies reveal that climate change (CC) has higher negative impacts on
   agricultural production than positive impacts. Therefore, this article
   attempts to explore the impacts of CC on oil palm production in Malaysia
   and provides mitigation and adaptation strategies towards reducing such
   impacts. The multiple regression analysis is applied to assess the
   impacts of CC on oil palm production by using time series data in the
   period of 1980 to 2010. A negative and significant relationship is found
   between annual average temperature and oil palm production. If
   temperature rises by 1 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 3 degrees C, and 4
   degrees C, production of oil palm can decrease from a range of 10 to
   41\%. This article has also found a negative impact of sea level rise
   (SLR) on oil palm production. Findings reveal that if areas under oil
   palm production decrease by 2\%, 4\%, and 8\% due to SLR of 0.5, 1, and
   2 m, oil palm production can decrease by 1.98\%, 3.96\%, and 7.92\%,
   respectively, indicating that CC has a significant impact on the
   reduction of oil palm production in Malaysia, ultimately affecting the
   sustainability of oil palm sector in Malaysia. Finally, this study
   suggests to practice appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies,
   including promotion and development of climate resilient varieties, soil
   and water conservation, afforestation, insurance and other risk transfer
   mechanisms, emission reduction technology, protection of coastal
   flooding for reducing the impacts of CC on oil palm production.},

Title = {National Adaptation Strategies, what else? Comparing adaptation
   mainstreaming in German and Dutch water management},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, governments in many countries began to integrate
   or mainstream climate change adaptation into a range of sectors.
   Comprehensive multi-sectoral adaptation strategies have emerged as the
   preferred approach across Europe. The German Adaptation Strategy is a
   prominent example for such a comprehensive strategy. It addresses 14
   sectors with national key issues and measures, and it provides
   orientation for other (mainly sub-national) actors. Against this trend,
   the Netherlands has pursued climate change adaptation mainly through a
   sectorally focused approach: the Dutch Delta Programme. Building on
   existing programmes,Governments in many it facilitates analysis and
   strategy development for long-term water management at a national scale
   with a strong regional focus. The present paper compares the two
   dissimilar governance approaches mainly with regard to how and to what
   degree they mainstream adaptation into water and coastal zone management
   in selected regions. After discussing strengths and weaknesses of the
   two approaches, we conclude that the more common multi-sectoral approach
   applied in Germany and most other OECD countries is not necessarily
   superior to sectorally focused approaches. Although the Dutch and the
   German cases appear to resemble alternatives, we highlight that their
   combination holds the promise to compensate for each other's weaknesses.
   Overall, we argue that diversity in the governance of climate change
   adaptation is desirable because it can help to prevent that several
   countries fail in similar ways.},

   ex ante and ex post climate adaptation in the marine environment. Its
   contributions include (1) a discussion of how management objectives and
   instruments influence resilience and adaptation; (2) a decision-making
   process to assess vulnerabilities to climate change and to manage
   adaptation responses: (3) an inter-temporal framework to assist
   decision-makers on when to adapt; (4) a risk and simulation approach to
   confront the uncertainties of the possible losses due to climate change
   and the net benefits of adaptation; (5) an explanation of how adaptive
   co-management can promote flexible adaptation responses and also
   strengthen adaptation capacity: and (6) a selection of possible
   `win-win' management actions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Climate change impacts on sea-ice ecosystems and associated ecosystem
   services},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {A rigorous synthesis of the sea-ice ecosystem and linked ecosystem
   services highlights that the sea-ice ecosystem supports all 4 ecosystem
   service categories, that sea-ice ecosystems meet the criteria for
   ecologically or biologically significant marine areas, that global
   emissions driving climate change are directly linked to the demise of
   sea-ice ecosystems and its ecosystem services, and that the sea-ice
   ecosystem deserves specific attention in the evaluation of marine
   protected area planning. The synthesis outlines (1) supporting services,
   provided in form of habitat, including feeding grounds and nurseries for
   microbes, meiofauna, fish, birds and mammals (particularly the key
   species Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, and Antarctic krill, Euphausia
   superba, which are tightly linked to the sea-ice ecosystem and transfer
   carbon from sea-ice primary producers to higher trophic level fish,
   mammal species and humans); (2) provisioning services through harvesting
   and medicinal and genetic resources; (3) cultural services through
   Indigenous and local knowledge systems, cultural identity and
   spirituality, and via cultural activities, tourism and research; (4)
   (climate) regulating services through light regulation, the production
   of biogenic aerosols, halogen oxidation and the release or uptake of
   greenhouse gases, for example, carbon dioxide. The ongoing changes in
   the polar regions have strong impacts on sea-ice ecosystems and
   associated ecosystem services. While the response of sea-ice-associated
   primary production to environmental change is regionally variable, the
   effect on iceassociated mammals and birds is predominantly negative,
   subsequently impacting human harvesting and cultural services in both
   polar regions. Conservation can help protect some species and functions.
   However, the key mitigation measure that can slow the transition to a
   strictly seasonal ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, reduce the overall loss
   of sea-ice habitats from the ocean, and thus preserve the unique
   ecosystem services provided by sea ice and their contributions to human
   well-being is a reduction in carbon emissions.},

Abstract = {Design and implementation of effective climate change adaptation
   activities requires quantitative assessment of the impacts that are
   likely to occur without adaptation, as well as the fraction of impact
   that can be avoided through each activity. Here we present a
   quantitative framework inspired by the greenhouse gas stabilization
   wedges of Pacala and Socolow. In our proposed framework, the damage
   avoided by each adaptation activity creates an `adaptation wedge'
   relative to the loss that would occur without that adaptation activity.
   We use premium winegrape suitability in the western United States as an
   illustrative case study, focusing on the near-term period that covers
   the years 2000-39. We find that the projected warming over this period
   results in the loss of suitable winegrape area throughout much of
   California, including most counties in the high-value North Coast and
   Central Coast regions. However, in quantifying adaptation wedges for
   individual high-value counties, we find that a large adaptation wedge
   can be captured by increasing the severe heat tolerance, including
   elimination of the 50\% loss projected by the end of the 2030-9 period
   in the North Coast region, and reduction of the projected loss in the
   Central Coast region from 30\% to less than 15\%. Increased severe heat
   tolerance can capture an even larger adaptation wedge in the Pacific
   Northwest, including conversion of a projected loss of more than 30\% in
   the Columbia Valley region of Washington to a projected gain of more
   than 150\%. We also find that warming projected over the near-term
   decades has the potential to alter the quality of winegrapes produced in
   the western US, and we discuss potential actions that could create
   adaptation wedges given these potential changes in quality. While the
   present effort represents an initial exploration of one aspect of one
   industry, the climate adaptation wedge framework could be used to
   quantitatively evaluate the opportunities and limits of climate
   adaptation within and across a broad range of natural and human systems.},

Title = {European CO2 fluxes from atmospheric inversions using regional and

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Volume = {103},

Pages = {93-115},

Abstract = {Approximately half of human-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are
   taken up by the land and ocean, and the rest stays in the atmosphere,
   increasing the global concentration and acting as a major greenhouse-gas
   (GHG) climate-forcing element. Although GHG mitigation is now in the
   political arena, the exact spatial distribution of the land sink is not
   well known. In this paper, an estimation of mean European net ecosystem
   exchange (NEE) carbon fluxes for the period 1998-2001 is performed with
   three mesoscale and two global transport models, based on the
   integration of atmospheric CO2 measurements into the same Bayesian
   synthesis inverse approach. A special focus is given to sub-continental
   regions of Europe making use of newly available CO2 concentration
   measurements in this region. Inverse flux estimates from the five
   transport models are compared with independent flux estimates from four
   ecosystem models. All inversions detect a strong annual carbon sink in
   the southwestern part of Europe and a source in the northeastern part.
   Such a dipole, although robust with respect to the network of stations
   used, remains uncertain and still to be confirmed with independent
   estimates. Comparison of the seasonal variations of the inversion-based
   net land biosphere fluxes (NEP) with the NEP predicted by the ecosystem
   models indicates a shift of the maximum uptake period, from June in the
   ecosystem models to July in the inversions. This study thus improves on
   the understanding of the carbon cycle at sub-continental scales over
   Europe, demonstrating that the methodology for understanding regional
   carbon cycle is advancing, which increases its relevance in terms of
   issues related to regional mitigation policies.},

Abstract = {This paper is an attempt to explore the indigenous coping strategies of
   cyclone-affected coastal people, especially in southwestern part of
   Bangladesh. This study has been conducted by using qualitative methods,
   i.e., case study, key informants interviews and focus group discussion
   were adopted to get the vivid and comprehensive panorama of coping
   strategies of cyclone-affected coastal people. The paper examines that
   coastal people envisaged with frequent and severe natural hazards
   throughout the years which severely affect their everyday life. The
   findings indicate that in order to cope with the hazards, coastal people
   change their housing structure, search new jobs, migrate elsewhere, rear
   alternative livestock, borrow money, take relief and so on. The findings
   also indicate that local people can perceive and predict about the
   imminent hazards by observing different indicators and take initiative
   for disaster prevention, mitigation and adaptation from their existing
   traditional knowledge and practices. There has not been conducted much
   empirical research on indigenous coping strategies of coastal people in
   natural hazards, so policy maker can get a comprehensive view about this
   context and implement it to national policy for comprehensive disaster
   management and adaptation.},

Abstract = {Every year thousands of people are being displaced in coastal areas of
   Bangladesh due to natural calamities associated with climate change,
   known as Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs). Climate change adaptation
   measures play a significant role in coping with the alteration of
   climatic components, while various forms of barriers hinder the
   sustainability of adaptation. This research was conducted to understand
   the perception of IDPs on climate change impact on health in the coastal
   areas of Bangladesh, including the adaptation practices and barriers to
   the coping strategies. To fulfill the objective, 420 individual surveys
   were conducted randomly in two Sub-districts of Khulna district in
   Bangladesh. The findings reveal that the riverbank erosion and cyclones
   were the primary reasons for displacement, and the social relationships
   were hampered in the new places of living. Also, the temperature in
   summer and winter, and the rainfall intensity increased, whereas
   rainfall slightly decreased over the last ten years. Differences of
   opinion were identified about the effects of the changing climatic
   variables on the respondents' health between the previous and present
   locations. Despite practicing different adaptive strategies, the weak
   financial condition and a lack of access to health care information are
   mostly hindering the sustainability of adaptation. This research may
   help policymakers in taking proper initiatives to ensure sustainable
   adaptation practices in the coastal areas.},

Abstract = {Selected aspects of currently running project UrbanAdapt are described.
   The project deals with the adaptation of cities on changing climatic
   conditions. The main project objective is to start the process of
   preparation of cities adaptation strategies, developing adaptation
   scenarios and testing the effects and benefits of particular measures.
   Previously developed models of adaptation impacts are used with
   available real data and according to several prepared scenarios to
   provide necessary decision making tools. The final policies have to take
   into account climatic conditions, available means, and devices to
   propose necessary amendments and solutions. Project team involves groups
   from different fields that cover various aspects of adaptation measures
   including economic analyses, policy making processes, education and
   dissemination to the public. The presented paper deals with the part of
   activities which are focused on modelling of adaptation measures and
   climatic impacts for the city of Prague.
   These activities include assessment of energy balance of city, in terms
   of interactions of solar radiation, atmosphere and urban environment.
   Urban environment includes not only buildings, street surfaces and
   vegetation, but also the processes having impact on energy balance such
   as the traffic, air conditioning and industry that produce anthropogenic
   heat which can play a role for example in summer heat waves.
   The ultimate goal is to assess the impact of different adaptation
   measures on citizens who live in environmental conditions of growing
   effect of urban heat island. Thus the connection between objective
   meteorological variables and subjective biological indices has to be
   investigated. The concept of Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET)
   is adopted. In comparison to single values of air temperature, air
   humidity, global horizontal irradiance, wind speed, and other
   meteorological indexes, concept of PET has added value in determining
   the value of important biometeorological index in easily recognizable
   quantity such as degrees C. Micro-scale models can be one way to study
   proposed adaptation measures such as tree alleys, bodies of water, etc.},

Abstract = {The vast majority of the growth in greenhouse gas emissions in the
   coming decades is expected to come from outside of the developed world.
   Yet on the whole, scholars have made only modest headway in identifying
   the distinctive features of effective environmental regulation in the
   developing world. This Article argues that a particular feature of the
   emerging economies-sharp regional economic disparities-need not be a
   barrier to climate change regulation. Instead, these disparities can be
   harnessed to make climate change regulation more effective.
   Taking China as its focus, this Article notes that both international
   law and Chinese domestic regulation have attempted to manage economic
   disparities according to the principle of common but differentiated
   responsibilities (CBDR). Building on these examples, it proposes a
   domestic CBDR approach for confronting China's climate change risks.
   Such an approach includes more stringent mitigation obligations for
   China's developed coastal provinces to the east, coupled with fiscal and
   technical support for developing provinces in China's interior.
   This Article contends that features of the Chinese sociopolitical
   context offer advantages in policy development and implementation that
   render a domestic CBDR approach more likely to succeed than its
   international counterpart. These advantages include normative legitimacy
   and confluence with other domestic policy objectives, in particular.
   Interest group influence and institutional capacity factors offer
   potential benefits, but also serious challenges.
   In the end, this Article aims to achieve two main goals: to highlight
   the importance of differentiated regulation in China's existing
   regulatory regime, and to argue that more extensive use of the approach
   can benefit policy formation and on-the-ground implementation alike.},

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) in subsurface reservoirs has been
   identified as a potentially cost-effective way to reduce CO2 emissions
   to the atmosphere. Global emissions reductions on the gigatonne scale
   using CCS will require regional or basin-scale deployment of CO2 storage
   in saline aquifers. Thus the evaluation of both the dynamic and ultimate
   CO2 storage capacity of formations is important for policy makers to
   determine the viability of CCS as a pillar of the greenhouse gas
   mitigation strategy in a particular region. We use a reservoir
   simulation model representing the large-scale Bunter Sandstone in the UK
   Southern North Sea to evaluate the dynamics and sensitivities of
   regional CO2 plume transport and storage. At the basin-scale, we predict
   hydrogeological changes in the storage reservoir in response to multiple
   regional carbon sequestration development scenarios. We test the
   sensitivity of injection capacity to a range of target CO2 injection
   rates and fluctuations in CO2 supply. Model sensitivities varying the
   target injection rates indicate that in the absence of pressure
   management up to 3.7 Gt of CO2 can be stored in the Bunter region over
   50 years given the pressure constraints set to avoid fracturing the
   formation. Long-term (approx. 1000 years), our results show that up to
   16 Gt of CO2 can be stored in the Bunter region without pressure
   management. With pressure management, the estimate rises to 32 Gt.
   However, consideration must be given to the additional operational and
   economic requirements of pressure management using brine production. (C)

Title = {Particularizing adaptation to non-predominant hazards: A history of
   wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland from 1903 to 2019},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen a historical turn in research on disaster risk
   reduction and climate change adaptation. This has included a call for
   historical research that particularizes adaptation in specific
   locations. This paper responds to this call by using newspaper archives
   to construct a history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland. This
   study goes beyond existing research that particularizes adaptation, by
   using this history as a lens through which to evaluate current
   adaptation policy. In doing so it uncovers problematic mismatches
   between the experience of local communities living with wildfire hazards
   and current climate change adaptation policies. National adaptation
   policy in Ireland presents uncontrolled wildfires as a largely new and
   unfamiliar hazard that requires innovative management approaches.
   However, newspaper archives reveal that local communities have adopted a
   variety of adaptive practices for wildfire hazards for over a century,
   and that these practices have coevolved with shifting economic, social,
   political, and cultural contexts. This paper also introduces the concept
   of non-predominant hazards, that is hazards that are often overlooked,
   forgotten, or neglected. Historical research on non-predominant hazards
   can play an important role in making visible trajectories of adaptation
   for such hazards. This study also points towards how deeper
   particularization studies that examine the long-term usage of specific
   adaptation practices can also be used to test the effectiveness of these
   practices through time, and to offer lessons for contemporary
   adaptation. These results have implications for disaster risk reduction
   and climate change adaptation to non-predominant hazards in a variety of
   contexts.},

Title = {In situ flux estimates reveal large variations in methane flux across
   the bottom boundary layer of a eutrophic lake},

Volume = {67},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Methane (CH4) produced in anoxic sediments plays a significant role in
   the carbon economy of many lakes and reservoirs. CH4 released from
   sediments first crosses the bottom boundary layer (BBL), the layer of
   water overlying the lakebed where currents are slowed by friction with
   the sediments below. Physical and biogeochemical conditions in the BBL,
   which can fluctuate hourly to daily with basin-wide internal waves
   (seiches), likely influence CH4 transport from sediments into the
   hypolimnion. In this study, we estimated CH4 fluxes across the BBL of a
   eutrophic lake using a novel in situ flux gradient approach adapted from
   marine applications. For 2-6 h periods throughout the spring and summer,
   we estimated CH4 fluxes across the BBL using simultaneous measurements
   of CH4 concentrations, turbulent mixing, and thermal stratification.
   Sub-daily variation in CH4 fluxes was high, and CH4 fluxes sometimes
   changed several-fold within hours. These rapid shifts in BBL fluxes were
   likely influenced by fluctuations in seiche-driven variations in the
   intensity of BBL turbulent mixing. Fluxes increased from spring to
   summer, concurrent with the development of lake stratification, and
   fueled an accumulation of CH4 below the thermocline. Throughout the
   summer, CH4 flux across the BBL exceeded CH4 accumulation below the
   thermocline, suggesting significant methanotrophy in the hypolimnion,
   consistent with incubation-based oxidation rates. Our results are the
   first to demonstrate sub-daily and seasonal variability in the timing
   and magnitude of CH4 fluxes within a lake BBL, and highlight a need to
   quantify such variability in other lentic systems.},

Title = {Climate change, seaports, and coastal management in Brazil: An overview
   of the policy framework},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Seaports are exposed to a variety of coastal risks, particularly when
   considering the effects of climate change, due to their location in the
   land-sea interface. The vulnerability of seaports, besides the
   robustness and design of their infrastructures, is also directly related
   to their adaptive capacity. A policy framework plays an important role
   in facing the effects of climate change by virtue of planning and
   supporting the implementation of adaptive measures. This research aims
   to identify and evaluate the extent to which the climate change topic is
   addressed by the port planning, coastal management, and climate
   adaptation policies of Brazil. A policy review was carried out and the
   documents were evaluated based on the achievement of the Sustainable
   Development Goal 13 (climate action) targets. A multiscale analysis was
   performed to identify how different management levels address the topic
   in their planning. The results suggest that although Brazil has
   effectively addressed the climate issue with its Adaptation National
   Plan, the coastal management framework and primarily port planning both
   remain uncertain. The existing coastal policies for climate adaptation
   purposes remain virtually not implemented, and accomplishments related
   to port adaptations are based only on a recent national sustainability
   guideline agenda. Although climate change impacts are perceived on a
   local scale, the Brazilian coastal ports and cities have not
   institutionalized efforts to taking climate-adaptive actions. This
   observed gap points out the necessity of policymakers to enhance the
   planning and application of adaptation measures at the local level, as
   well as promote the cooperation between multiscale sectoral agencies.
   This overview illustrates several opportunities to update, redesign, and
   innovate coastal and port management instruments to address
   climate-related issues. Nature-based Solutions would appear as a
   fundamental approach to be incorporated in multi-scale policy
   frameworks, which would support coastal ports and cities in their
   becoming climate-resilient, thus containing socio-economic losses and
   environmental deterioration.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Coastal flooding risks are becoming increasingly important because of
   the increasing vulnerability of coastal territories and the rise of
   ocean levels in relation to climate change. Studying the adaptation to
   these phenomena requires taking into account the coping strategies
   (problem-focused or emotional-focused coping) implemented by the
   inhabitants of the exposed territories. A theoretical model of
   situational and dispositional factors determining these strategies has
   been proposed and tested empirically with 583 inhabitants of the island
   of Guadeloupe, which is exposed to said coastal flooding risk. The fit
   index confirms the adequacy of the model. The results indicate that
   coastal flooding risk perception, difficulties to regulate emotions, and
   place attachment predict avoidance coping. Vigilant coping is only
   predicted by perceived action efficiency. The roles of duration of
   residence and distance from the sea have been highlighted.},

Title = {Climate Change Perceptions, Impacts and Adaptation Strategies: Insights
   of Fishers in Zambezi River Basin, Zimbabwe},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Zambezi River Basin is considered to be highly vulnerable to the
   impacts of climate change and adverse weather events, which might cause
   serious environmental, economic, and social consequences for millions of
   people. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how natural
   resource-dependent people perceive climate change, and how they adapt to
   the changes, as it is very important for climate change adaptation
   policy formulation and its implementation. Therefore, this study seeks
   to assess fishers perceptions of climate change, its impacts on fishery
   resources and livelihoods, and their adaptation strategies. Data were
   collected from 120 fishers in two basins (Binga and Kariba) along the
   shores of Lake Kariba using a mixed-method research approach.
   Meteorological data were obtained from the Meteorological Department
   Services of Zimbabwe (MSDZ). The findings show that fishers of Lake
   Kariba have observed changes in temperature and rainfall trends. Fishers
   believe that the perceived changes of the climatic variables have led to
   a decline in fish productivity and fish catches. To cope with declining
   fish stocks and catches, fishers have adopted several adaptation
   strategies, including changing fishing gear, targeting new fish species,
   and increasing fishing efforts. These study findings help to set a path
   towards local specific climate change adaptation strategies for
   small-scale fishers. This study provided relevant information for policy
   makers and fisheries stewards to formulate appropriate policies and
   programmes aimed at enhancing fishers adaptation to climate change and
   promote sustainable fisheries.},

Title = {A novel illustration of real options analysis to address the problem of
   probabilities under deep uncertainty and changing climate risk},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Abstract = {Changing risk profiles over time that are exacerbated by climate change,
   challenge assessments of the relative value of investing in different
   adaptation options. There is a growing discourse around methods that are
   better suited to addressing changing risk and uncertainties for large
   infrastructure projects - robust decision making (RDM), real options
   analysis (ROA) and those based on dynamic adaptive pathways planning
   (DAPP). While such approaches are receiving greater attention in the
   academic literature, there is a gap in critiques of them in real-life
   decision practice. Here we present two novel applications from New
   Zealand of real options analysis that formed part of actual decision
   processes - a flood risk management plan and a coastal hazards strategy,
   both based on DAPP over 100 years. In both cases, we examined the value
   of pursuing adaptation options that are flexible under peak river flows,
   coastal erosion, imminent inundation, storm surge and long-term
   sea-level rise. From lessons learned we examined three questions
   relating to ROA: 1) is ROA `fit for purpose' for investment evaluations
   in situations of both imminent threat and deep uncertainty and its
   scalability? 2) can ROA address path dependency and move beyond static
   applications? 3) can ROA be used alongside DAPP to address managed
   retreat as an adaptation option. We conclude the affirmative for each
   question and provide a method for using ROA within a DAPP and RDM
   framework.},

Abstract = {Many coastal communities rely on living marine resources for livelihoods
   and food security. These resources are commonly under stress from
   overfishing, pollution, coastal development and habitat degradation.
   Climate change is an additional stressor beginning to impact coastal
   systems and communities, but may also lead to opportunities for some
   species and the people they sustain. We describe the research approach
   for a multi-country project, focused on the southern hemisphere,
   designed to contribute to improving fishing community adaptation efforts
   by characterizing, assessing and predicting the future of coastal-marine
   food resources, and co-developing adaptation options through the
   provision and sharing of knowledge across fast-warming marine regions
   (i.e. marine `hotspots'). These hotspots represent natural laboratories
   for observing change and concomitant human adaptive responses, and for
   developing adaptation options and management strategies. Focusing on
   adaptation options and strategies for enhancing coastal resilience at
   the local level will contribute to capacity building and local
   empowerment in order to minimise negative outcomes and take advantage of
   opportunities arising from climate change. However, developing
   comparative approaches across regions that differ in political
   institutions, socio-economic community demographics, resource dependency
   and research capacity is challenging. Here, we describe physical,
   biological, social and governance tools to allow hotspot comparisons,
   and several methods to evaluate and enhance interactions within a
   multi-nation research team. Strong partnerships within and between the
   focal regions are critical to scientific and political support for
   development of effective approaches to reduce future vulnerability.
   Comparing these hotspot regions will enhance local adaptation responses
   and generate outcomes applicable to other regions.},

Abstract = {This study explores the potential effectiveness of metropolitan land
   cover change as a climate change adaptation strategy for managing rising
   temperatures in a large and rapidly warming metropolitan region of the
   United States. Through the integration of a mesoscale meteorological
   model with estimated land cover data for the Atlanta, Georgia region in
   2010, this study quantifies the influence of extensive land cover change
   at the periphery of a large metropolitan region on temperature within
   the city center. The first study to directly model a metropolitan scale
   heat transfer mechanism, we find both enhanced tree canopy and
   impervious cover hi the suburban zones of the Atlanta region to produce
   statistically significant cooling and warming effects in the urban core.
   Based on these findings, we conclude that urban heat island management
   both within and beyond the central developed core of large cities may
   provide an effective climate change adaptation strategy for large
   metropolitan regions.},

Abstract = {Farming adaptation in low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh is mandatory
   due to increasing impacts of climate change on agriculture. The study
   evaluated farmers' perception on climate-related hazards, climate
   variables and factors. Further, the study identified different existence
   sustainable farming adaptation measures. The final outcomes are
   concluded throughout synergic data analysis, quantitative including
   climatic and environmental data, and qualitative from farmers'
   perception. Eight focus group discussions, 200 household surveys and six
   key informant interviews were carried out to receive farmers' perception
   on climate change and impacts of agriculture. Results revealed that
   farmers' perception and climate data analytical outcomes for decreasing
   annual precipitation and increasing temperature are highly correlated,
   whereas 20-year (1995-2015) climate data from 11 meteorological stations
   showed that annual precipitation is decreased 548 mm, and atmospheric
   annual mean temperature is increased 1.06 degrees C. Crop model showed a
   change in cropping seasons, where the autumn and late autumn are no
   longer existing and monsoon season is moving toward the winter. Farmers'
   are migrating their occupations which showed the seasonal livelihood
   calendar and choosing shrimp and crab cultivation nowadays. Pearson
   Chi-square independence test identified the significant relationship
   between 24 independent and 4 dependent variables. This statistical
   analysis identified five key factors, including climatic, social,
   environmental, economic and physical, for farming adaptation due to
   climate change. The study exposed that farmers are adapted 11
   adaptations strategies introduced by the local farming community,
   governmental and non-governmental officials. However, according to
   farmers' communities these measures are not well managed. Therefore,
   this study explored the farmers' needs for better sustainable farming
   adaptation strategies based on climatic data scenarios. In conclusion,
   the outcomes will support to achieve SDG 2 for southwest coastal areas
   in Bangladesh.},

Title = {Climate change mitigation opportunities based on carbon footprint
   estimates of dietary patterns in Peru},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Food consumption accounts for an important proportion of the world GHG
   emissions per capita. Previous studies have delved into the nature of
   dietary patterns, showing that GHG reductions can be achieved in diets
   if certain foods are consumed rather than other, more GHG intensive
   products. For instance, vegetarian and low-meat diets have proved to be
   less carbon intensive than diets that are based on ruminant meat. These
   environmental patterns, increasingly analyzed in developed nations, are
   yet to be assessed in countries liked Peru where food purchase
   represents a relatively high percentage of the average household
   expenditure, ranging from 38\% to 51\% of the same. Therefore, food
   consumption can be identified as a potential way to reduce GHG emissions
   in Peru. However, the Peruvian government lacks a specific strategy to
   mitigate emissions in this sector, despite the recent ratification of
   the Paris Accord. In view of this, the main objective of this study is
   to analyze the environmental impacts of a set of 47 Peruvian food diet
   profiles, including geographical and socioeconomic scenarios. In order
   to do this, Life Cycle Assessment was used as the methodological
   framework to obtain the overall impacts of the components in the dietary
   patterns observed and primary data linked to the composition of diets
   were collected from the Peruvian National Institute for Statistics
   (INEI). Life cycle inventories for the different products that are part
   of the Peruvian diet were obtained from a set of previous scientific
   articles and reports regarding food production. Results were computed
   using the IPCC 2013 assessment method to estimate GHG emissions. Despite
   variations in GHG emissions from a geographical perspective, no
   significant differences were observed between cities located in the
   three Peruvian natural regions (i.e., coast, Andes and Amazon basin). In
   contrast, there appears to be a strong, positive correlation between GHG
   emissions and social expenditure or academic status. When compared to
   GHG emissions computed in the literature for developed nations, where
   the average caloric intake is substantially higher, diet-related
   emissions in Peru were in the low range. Our results could be used as a
   baseline for policy support to align nutritional and health policies in
   Peru with the need to reduce the environmental impacts linked to food
   production.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1127-1144},

Abstract = {Jakarta, as the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, has long been
   known to be at risk from flood hazard. It is increasingly recognized
   that community responses and adaptation strategies are essential for
   planning future mitigation action. In order to investigate the community
   responses and adaptation strategies employed in Jakarta, in-depth
   interviews were performed in the flood-prone areas. The results reveal
   that vulnerability to flooding is increasing, and it is linked to
   several factors: (1) stakeholders, (2) environment, (3) communities, and
   (4) infrastructure and its maintenance. Various physical adaptation
   strategies have been adopted by the local communities, which include
   raising the housing level, building terraced housing, and building small
   dikes to prevent water entering the settlements. Several non-physical
   adaptations were also identified from the fieldwork. These adaptations
   tend to be conducted through communal work and the reuse of resources
   and materials left undamaged by flooding. However, uncoordinated
   responses during flood events produce greater exposure to the hazard,
   and it can be inferred that community responses remain below the ideal.
   This study highlights the need for urgent attention to be given to
   improving the institutional links between stakeholders, especially at
   the municipal level, which could provide more efficient disaster
   response.},

Title = {Climate adaptation to Multi-Hazard climate related risks in ten
   Indonesian Cities: Ambitions and challenges},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Abstract = {Indonesian coastal cities are faced with a double imperative to urbanize
   quickly and to adapt to climate-related disasters. These disasters
   include droughts, storms, regular floods, tidal waves, and water
   pollution. This article investigates how ten small- and medium-sized
   coastal cities in Indonesia are developing resilience strategies to cope
   with disaster risks. It approaches their level of exposure, the current
   impacts of climate change, and the existing, local resilience strategies
   or response. It identifies key discussion points related to the
   implementation and the feasibility of these strategies. We argue in this
   article that the priorities are severalfold, and that local governments
   are increasingly faced with trade-offs when selecting specific
   interventions and neighborhoods or districts to prioritize to the
   detriment of others. The current coping strategies seem insufficient to
   reduce, respond to, and recover from climate-related impacts as well as
   address the question of vulnerabilities. The population in the coastal
   areas and in informal settlements, mainly the poor population, is more
   directly exposed to these climate-related hazards. The local research
   highlights the difficulties of multi-stakeholder cooperation, the
   inevitable trade-offs or difficult choices, and the lack of adequate
   instruments in climate adaptation. Finally, this article calls for more
   specific timely research on climate adaptation in cities.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {The multi-model ensemble (MME) of 20 models from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase Five (CMIP5) was used to analyze surface
   climate change in the 21st century under the representative
   concentration pathway RCP2.6, to reflect emission mitigation efforts.
   The maximum increase of surface air temperature (SAT) is 1.86A degrees C
   relative to the pre-industrial level, achieving the target to limit the
   global warming to 2A degrees C. Associated with the
   ``increase-peak-decline{''} greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentration
   pathway of RCP2.6, the global mean SAT of MME shows opposite trends
   during two time periods: warming during 2006-55 and cooling during
   2056-2100. Our results indicate that spatial distribution of the linear
   trend of SAT during the warming period exhibited asymmetrical features
   compared to that during the cooling period. The warming during 2006-55
   is distributed globally, while the cooling during 2056-2100 mainly
   occurred in the NH, the South Indian Ocean, and the tropical South
   Atlantic Ocean. Different dominant roles of heat flux in the two time
   periods partly explain the asymmetry. During the warming period, the
   latent heat flux and shortwave radiation both play major roles in
   heating the surface air. During the cooling period, the increase of net
   longwave radiation partly explains the cooling in the tropics and
   subtropics, which is associated with the decrease of total cloud amount.
   The decrease of the shortwave radiation accounts for the prominent
   cooling in the high latitudes of the NH. The surface sensible heat flux,
   latent heat flux, and shortwave radiation collectively contribute to the
   especial warming phenomenon in the high-latitude of the SH during the
   cooling period.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation in Cambodia's coastal hotel sector: An
   analysis of adaptation measures and hotel characteristics},
Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {After decades of profound challenges Cambodia has seen twenty years of
   stability and a flourishing tourism industry, however, it has also been
   identified as highly vulnerable to climate change thus putting the
   country's long-desired economic development at risk. Sustainable
   Development Goal 13 `Climate Action' is critical for the continued
   economic success of Cambodia's vulnerable coastal tourism sector, but
   little is known about the hotel sector's adaptation responses and the
   differences between key hotel characteristics such as star rating, size,
   ownership and length of operation. This article examines the adaptation
   actions by 50 Cambodian coastal hotels by distinguishing between five
   adaptation categories. Subsequently, the analysis is deepened through a
   comparative analysis of key hotel characteristics. Although adaptation
   measures varied considerably between hotels they were more comprehensive
   and numerous than expected. Furthermore, patterns emerged that saw large
   hotels apply high levels of adaptation while budget and Khmer-owned
   hotels reported limited adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {Adaptation is a key strategy to reduce the severe impacts of climate
   change on the fishery. Adaptation strategies are unlikely to be
   effective without an understanding of the fishermen's perception on

   change perceptions and their climate change adaptation in response to
   the perceived impacts of climate change. A survey by interviewing
   randomly selected 90 marine capture fishermen was conducted in Bengkulu
   from March to June 2018. The results indicate that most fishermen
   understand climate change as a change of east and west monsoon that
   directly affect their fishing activities. In terms of climate change
   defined as a continuous change of temperature, humidity, and rainfall,
   most fishermen have no sufficient knowledge on climate change. The
   important adaptation strategies include diversification of household
   economic activities, augmenting of fishing gear, change the fishing
   ground, mobilization of family members to work, and fishing time
   adjustment.},

Title = {Continuous Monitoring and Future Projection of Ocean Warming,

   Japan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {As the ocean absorbs excessive anthropogenic CO2 and ocean acidification
   proceeds, it is thought to be harder for marine calcifying organisms,
   such as shellfish, to form their skeletons and shells made of calcium
   carbonate. Recent studies have suggested that various marine organisms,
   both calcifiers and non-calcifiers, will be affected adversely by ocean
   warming and deoxygenation. However, regardless of their effects on
   calcifiers, the spatiotemporal variability of parameters affecting ocean
   acidification and deoxygenation has not been elucidated in the subarctic
   coasts of Japan. This study conducted the first continuous monitoring
   and future projection of physical and biogeochemical parameters of the
   subarctic coast of Hokkaido, Japan. Our results show that the seasonal
   change in biogeochemical parameters, with higher pH and dissolved oxygen
   (DO) concentration in winter than in summer, was primarily regulated by
   water temperature. The daily fluctuations, which were higher in the
   daytime than at night, were mainly affected by daytime photosynthesis by
   primary producers and respiration by marine organisms at night. Our
   projected results suggest that, without ambitious commitment to reducing
   CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, such as by following the Paris
   Agreement, the impact of ocean warming and acidification on calcifiers
   along subarctic coasts will become serious, exceeding the critical level
   of high temperature for 3 months in summer and being close to the
   critical level of low saturation state of calcium carbonate for 2 months
   in mid-winter, respectively, by the end of this century. The impact of
   deoxygenation might often be prominent assuming that the daily
   fluctuation in DO concentration in the future is similar to that at
   present. The results also suggest the importance of adaptation
   strategies by local coastal industries, especially fisheries, such as
   modifying aquaculture styles.

Abstract = {Vulnerability to climate change, water scarcity, and food security in
   tropical Small Island Developing Sate (SIDS) are attracting increased
   attention. Water scarcity induced by climate change and variability
   could have serious consequences for economic development and food
   security and has led to calls for more efficient and sustainable
   adaptation measures. This research details the investigation of the
   economic impacts associated with adapting groundwater abstraction
   policies to address the sustainability of meeting competing needs for
   groundwater. An integrated optimization framework is developed that
   contains climate scenarios, land use, agronomy, groundwater, economic
   performance and an abstraction adaptation strategy with a numerical
   example of a tropical island. The findings indicate increased adverse
   economic impacts of climate change (being just a shift in the long-run
   average condition) on water availability, food security, and urban
   livelihoods as compared to those impacts associated with climate
   variability alone. Variability in precipitation associated with climate
   variability (no change in the climate baseline) tends to alleviate the
   negative impact of the climate change. Those economic impacts, however,
   are found to have an unequal distribution across the different competing
   sectors. Food producers and household users would bear the adverse
   consequences of climate change and variability. This is especially the
   case when an adaptation policy based on maintaining water sustainability
   is imposed. The framework provides a holistic tool for exploring the
   effectiveness of groundwater adaptation strategies and possible policy
   responses to climate change and variability.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions are recognised to be a problem of growing severity.
   Human pathogens, weeds or pests in terrestrial systems and dominant
   alien species in freshwater or marine aquatic systems all impose
   significant costs in terms of forgone output or costs of control in
   every major system. Like many of the other environmental consequences of
   globalisation, biological invasions require that decisions be taken
   under uncertainty. Decision-makers in such circumstances have to choose
   between two main strategies: mitigation and adaptation. This paper
   characterises invasive species problems in terms of the properties of
   the stochastic processes they induce. It considers how mitigation and
   adaptation strategies may be modelled, and identifies the conditions in
   which each approach may be efficient and effective. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {Climate change induced great challenges for agriculture, particularly
   implementation of new farming practices. Adaptation to climate change
   requires sustainable and environmentally friendly farm-level management
   practices and methods, and most promising of them are offered by an
   ecosystem approach and agroecological principles. The paper presents the
   results of the research, which has twofold aim: 1) to determine the most
   promising ecosystem based adaptation measures to climate change for
   Latvia's crop farms via evaluating recommendations; 2) to evaluate the
   implementation and possibilities of adaptation measures via assessing
   trends in Latvia, as well as comparing status among the countries in the
   Baltic Sea region. The data was obtained from the EU and national
   statistical database. The mixed research, combining suitable qualitative
   and quantitative research methods, was used. Most promising adaptation
   measures to climate change for implementation in the Latvia's crop farms
   could be combination of conservation agriculture practices (i.e. minimum
   soil disturbance, crop diversification, and permanent soil cover) with
   agroecological farm management practices. The results show that in
   Latvia, with the exception in the organic agriculture sector, in
   particular in the organic farming, the above mentioned climate
   adaptation measures at farm level have not yet been introduced and
   implemented sufficiently and effectively, especially compared to other
   EU countries in the Baltic Sea region.},

Title = {A Spatial Integrated SLR Adaptive Management Plan Framework (SISAMP)
   toward Sustainable Coasts},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) is known as a central part of the Earth's response
   to human-induced global warming and is projected to continue to rise
   over the twenty-first century and beyond. The importance of coastal
   areas for both human and natural systems has led researchers to conduct
   extensive studies on coastal vulnerability to SLR impacts and develop
   adaptation options to cope with rising sea level. Investigations to date
   have focused mostly on developed and highly populated coasts, as well as
   diverse ecosystems including tidal salt marshes and mangroves. As a
   result, there is less information on vulnerability and adaptation of
   less-developed and developing coasts to sea-level rise and its
   associated impacts. Hence, this research aimed at outlining an
   appropriate coastal management framework to adapt to SLR on the coasts
   that are in the early stage of development. A coastal area with a low
   level of development, located in southern Iran along the Gulf of Oman,
   was selected as a case study. The types of lands exposed to the high-end
   estimates of SLR by 2100 were identified and used as the primary
   criteria in determining the practical adaptation approaches for
   developing coasts. The result of coastal exposure assessment showed
   that, of five exposed land cover types, bare land, which is potentially
   considered for development, has the highest percentage of exposure to
   future sea-level rise. In order to protect the exposed coastal lands
   from future development and increase adaptive capacity of coastal
   systems, we developed a Spatial Integrated SLR Adaptive Management Plan
   Framework (SISAMP) based on an exposure reduction approach. Spatial land
   management tools and coastal exposure assessment models along with three
   other key components were integrated into the proposed conceptual
   framework to reduce coastal vulnerability through minimizing exposure of
   coastal communities to SLR-induced impacts. This adaptation plan
   provides a comprehensive approach for sustainable coastal management in
   a changing climate, particularly on developing coasts.},

Title = {Environmental impact of desalination processes: Mitigation and control
   strategies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {740},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Freshwater supplies are in shortage relative to the high demand for
   different human activities, making desalination of saline water a must.
   Desalination to extract water from saline water has been well
   established as a reliable non-conventional water supply. However,
   desalination as any human-based process has resulted in many impacts on
   the environment. Brine loaded with chemicals being discharged back to
   the environment, along with greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions being
   released to the atmosphere, are the most significant impacts, which has
   been extensively studied, with some efforts given to its mitigation and
   control.
   The current work discusses the mitigation and control strategies (M\&CS)
   to the different environmental impacts (Els) of desalination processes.
   The article compiles the M\&CS in one work, instead of the distributed
   and separate treatment of the Els of each desalination step and its
   respective M\&CS as currently present in literature. The article tracks
   the water flow in an intake-to-outfall approach exploring how to
   minimize the impacts at each step and as a whole process. This starts
   from intake, pretreatment processes, desalination technology, and
   finally, brine discharge. The Els associated with each desalination
   process element is thoroughly discussed with proposed M\&CS. The work
   shows clearly that many Els can be eliminated or minimized by
   incorporating specific design criteria and process improvements. The
   feedwater source has shown to have a great effect on Els. Similarly,
   desalination technology has shown a considerable effect on the Els
   related to brine characteristics and energy consumption. Hybrid and
   emerging desalination systems have shown reduced Els relative to
   conventional thermal and membrane desalination technologies, while the
   utilization of renewable and waste energy sources has shown a
   significant reduction in Els related to energy consumption. (C) 2020

Title = {Sea Level Rise and Coastal Impacts: Innovation and Improvement of the
   Local Urban Plan for a Climate-Proof Adaptation Strategy},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, the territorial impacts connected to sea level rise
   have prompted a reflection on the responsibilities of policy makers in
   transposing these issues into urban agendas. The need also emerged to
   both broaden and update the skills of urban planners and to improve
   territorial governance tools, with the aim of developing feasible
   regeneration and resilience strategies to face climate change. In this
   paper, a methodology for the production of Flood Risk Maps is presented,
   as applied to the Municipality of Ravenna, Italy, by only considering
   the static component of inundation hazard, i.e., the projected Mean Sea
   Level Rise, as a first step towards increased preparedness. The
   resulting Flood Risk Maps represent, in fact, an innovation with respect
   to the current cognitive framework that supports local urban planning,
   by providing information on a potential risk that has so far been
   overlooked. The method combines sea level rise projections under the
   pessimistic RCP8.5 scenario with georeferenced territorial data, aiming
   to identify the physical consistency of the urban-structure components
   which are potentially at risk. For successive time horizons (2030, 2050
   and 2100), our results show the progressive impairment and potential
   degradation of extensive urban areas that are disregarded in the urban
   planning regulations currently in force. This preliminary evaluation
   phase is aimed at prompting and supporting the necessary updating of the
   planning tools and regulations adopted by the public bodies responsible
   for territorial governance, by identifying priority areas for
   intervention, and helping define mitigation and adaptation actions.},

Abstract = {Maritime transportation has been a cost-effective option among other
   transport modes. Meanwhile, this demand has been increasing day by day
   because of the expanding global economy. The ships are one of the most
   important transport and trade vehicles in the world; 90\% of the world
   trade is carried out by maritime transport, and this sector plays a
   crucial role in climate change and global warming because it is one of
   the key sectors leading to emissions of carbon dioxide, the main
   greenhouse gas (GHG). In other sectors that lead to CO2 emissions, i.e.,
   energy production, manufacturing industry, and heating in residences,
   energy efficiency has been improved and emissions have been reduced
   significantly. However, there has been no net reduction in the transport
   sector; total CO2 emissions have also increased because of the
   continuous increase in freight and passenger traffic, although
   efficiency has increased. Increasing the energy efficiency of a ship
   allows for fuel consumption reduction and GHG emissions. In this study,
   the energy system of a chemical tanker ship was analyzed and then
   modeled by using the long-range energy alternatives planning system, a
   widely used platform for energy policy analysis and climate change
   mitigation assessment, including a comprehensive energy flow diagram,
   namely, reference energy system. A base scenario was developed, and the
   ship's energy system was convenient to be analyzed and evaluated in
   terms of technical, economic, and environmental aspects, including
   low-emission development strategies, to comply with marine engine
   regulations of the International Maritime Organization.},

Title = {Assessing Biofuel Crop Invasiveness: A Case Study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {Background: There is widespread interest in biofuel crops as a solution
   to the world's energy needs, particularly in light of concerns over
   greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite reservations about their adverse
   environmental impacts, no attempt has been made to quantify actual,
   relative or potential invasiveness of terrestrial biofuel crops at an
   appropriate regional or international scale, and their planting
   continues to be largely unregulated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a widely accepted weed risk
   assessment system, we analyzed a comprehensive list of regionally
   suitable biofuel crops to show that seventy percent have a high risk of
   becoming invasive versus one-quarter of non-biofuel plant species and
   are two to four times more likely to establish wild populations locally
   or be invasive in Hawaii or in other locations with a similar climate.
   Conclusions/Significance: Because of climatic and ecological
   similarities, predictions of biofuel crop invasiveness in Hawaii are
   applicable to other vulnerable island and subtropical ecosystems
   worldwide. We demonstrate the utility of an accessible and
   scientifically proven risk assessment protocol that allows users to
   predict if introduced species will become invasive in their region of
   interest. Other evidence supports the contention that propagule pressure
   created by extensive plantings will exacerbate invasions, a scenario
   expected with large-scale biofuel crop cultivation. Proactive measures,
   such as risk assessments, should be employed to predict invasion risks,
   which could then be mitigated via implementation of appropriate planting
   policies and adoption of the ``polluter-pays'' principle.},

Title = {Framing the application of adaptation pathways for rural livelihoods and

Abstract = {In developing countries adaptation responses to climate and global
   change should be integrated with human development to generate no
   regrets, co-benefit strategies for the rural poor, but there are few
   examples of how to achieve this. The adaptation pathways approach
   provides a potentially useful decision-making framework because it aims
   to steer societies towards sustainable futures by accounting for complex
   systems, uncertainty and contested multi-stakeholder arenas, and by
   maintaining adaptation options. Using Nusa Tenggara Barat Province,
   Indonesia, as an example we consider whether generic justifications for
   adaptation pathways are tenable in the local context of climate and
   global change, rural poverty and development. Interviews and focus
   groups held with a cross-section of provincial leaders showed that the
   causes of community vulnerability are indeed highly complex and dynamic,
   influenced by 20 interacting drivers, of which climate variability and
   change are only two. Climate change interacts with population growth and
   ecosystem degradation to reduce land, water and food availability.
   Although poverty is resilient due to corruption, traditional
   institutions and fatalism, there is also considerable system flux due to
   decentralisation, modernisation and erosion of traditional culture.
   Together with several thresholds in drivers, potential shocks and
   paradoxes, these characteristics result in unpredictable system
   trajectories. Decision-making is also contested due to tensions around
   formal and informal leadership, corruption, community participation in
   planning and female empowerment. Based on this context we propose an
   adaptation pathways approach which can address the proximate and
   systemic causes of vulnerability and contested decision-making.
   Appropriate participatory processes and governance structures are
   suggested, including integrated livelihoods and multi-scale systems
   analysis, scenario planning, adaptive co-management and `livelihood
   innovation niches'. We briefly discuss how this framing of adaptation
   pathways would differ from one in the developed context of neighbouring
   Australia, including the influence of the province's island geography on
   the heterogeneity of livelihoods and climate change, the pre-eminence
   and rapid change of social drivers, and the necessity to `leap-frog' the
   Millennium Development Goals by mid-century to build adaptive capacity
   for imminent climate change impacts. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published

Title = {Social connectivity and adaptive capacity strategies in large-scale
   fisheries},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Large-scale fisheries are important social-ecological systems that are
   increasingly being threatened by global climate change. Adaptive
   capacity is key for moving fisheries onto climate resilient pathways,
   however, implementing policies to improve adaptive capacity is
   challenging given the many diverse stakeholders involved in fisheries.
   Previous research suggests social networks are integral to adaptive
   capacity because social connectivity can enable, or constrain, knowledge
   and information sharing. We examine the network of communication among
   stakeholders in the Basque tropical tuna freezer purse seine fishery in
   the eastern Atlantic Ocean. We use cluster analysis, descriptive
   statistics, and exponential random graph models to assess whether
   different types of actors, occupying different network positions, value
   similar adaptive capacity strategies. The results indicate that many
   actor types are frequently connected within the fishery. Preferences for
   adaptive capacity strategies vary within and across actor types, and the
   preferences of highly central actors are generally more homogeneous and
   narrowly focused. All actors agree on the importance of the social
   organization domain from adaptive capacity, while fishing industry
   representatives tend to have the most holistic perspective on adaptive
   capacity overall. We discuss the implications of these findings as they
   relate to policies for supporting adaptive capacity and climate
   resilient fisheries.},

Title = {Adaptation and mitigation strategies for controlling stochastic water

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {337-347},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyse and compare the costs of two
   strategies against transboundary water pollution, mitigation and
   adaptation measures, which are linked with respect to risk. Chance
   constraint programming is applied, and the analytical results indicate
   that total costs for given probabilistic targets are higher (lower) than
   the costs without risk linkage for negative (positive) covariance
   between the two classes of measures. A comparison of two international
   policies-cooperation and national uniform standards-indicates that
   cleaning under non-cooperative uniform national standards can be
   increased when considering stochastic pollution and linkage in risk
   between mitigation and adaptation measures. The empirical application to
   the Baltic Sea shows that the risk linkage can increase or decrease
   minimum costs for a given probabilistic target under cooperative
   solutions by 17 or 13\%, and decrease the cost under national uniform
   policy for a given overall probabilistic target by approximately 10\%.

Abstract = {The current paper introduces an innovative multicriteria wind potential
   assessment study using fuzzy logic in decision making. Regarding the
   diverse conditions and lack of comprehensive studies, Iran was selected
   as a case study, and by applying the proposed framework, all the 559
   synoptic meteorological stations in the country were studied. Fourteen
   technical, eco-environmental, and social indicators were defined for the
   assessment. Each of the indicator's effectiveness was determined using
   related literature and interviews with local experts. Finally, using
   fuzzy logic in decision making, all the selected sites and the provinces
   were scored and ranked. Moreover, the priority maps of Iran provinces
   considering social and eco-environmental aspects were provided. The
   selected sites' final standing for the development of offshore and
   onshore wind power plant was also determined. The results indicate that
   taking just the technical conditions into account can result in
   misleading conclusions and social and eco-environmental criteria must
   also be considered for potential assessment studies. Moreover, it was
   shown that equal supportive policies for wind development throughout the
   country would mitigate their efficiency. Therefore, the energy
   strategies should be codified, considering local circumstances to
   organize investment resources, leading to higher legislation
   efficiencies and faster development.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions from peat lands are key sources of overall
   emissions in Indonesia. These emissions are mainly caused by fires and
   to a lesser extent decomposition of degraded peat lands which have been
   cleared for either food crop or palm productions. Land clearing has
   taken place since the colonial times; however, it had accelerated
   dramatically since the mid-90s, fuelled by palm oil expansion and poorly
   planned efforts to open peat land for food production.
   Fire activity is driven by clearing peat forest lands. Risk of fires
   increases significantly during drier than normal years, often linked to
   El Nino phenomena. Once fires are ignited in peat areas, they tend to be
   submerged, making them difficult to extinguish. This prompts the need
   for an anticipatory approach to fire management. Such an approach would
   enact anticipatory risk reduction actions 1-3 months ahead of an
   anticipated fire outbreak. These actions would be integrated into
   existing standard operating procedures for fire prevention, while at the
   same time mainstreaming fire risk reduction into spatial and development
   planning to address long-term fire vulnerability.
   The collaboration between the Earth Institute at Columbia University and
   the Institut Pertanian Bogor's (IPB) Centre for Climate Risk and
   Opportunity Management in Southeast Asia Pacific (CCROM SEAP), with
   support from the National REDD+ Agency and facilitated by the United
   Nations Office for REDD+ Coordination in Indonesia (UNORCID), has
   resulted in the development of a seasonal fire early warning system,
   known as the Fire Risk System (FRS), for managing fires at the
   provincial and district level, with particular focus on Central
   Kalimantan and Riau provinces. The system is designed to enhance
   capacity of national, provincial and local stakeholders to prevent fires
   and addressing underlying fire vulnerably by integrating anticipatory
   actions into planning processes.},

Abstract = {Emissions of exhaust gases and particles from oceangoing ships are a
   significant and growing contributor to the total emissions from the
   transportation sector. We present an assessment of the contribution of
   gaseous and particulate emissions from oceangoing shipping to
   anthropogenic emissions and air quality. We also assess the degradation
   in human health and climate change created by these emissions.
   Regulating ship emissions requires comprehensive knowledge of current
   fuel consumption and emissions, understanding of their impact on
   atmospheric composition and climate, and projections of potential future
   evolutions and mitigation options. Nearly 70\% of ship emissions occur
   within 400 km of coastlines, causing air quality problems through the
   formation of ground-level ozone, sulphur emissions and particulate
   matter in coastal areas and harbours with heavy traffic. Furthermore,
   ozone and aerosol precursor emissions as well as their derivative
   species from ships may be transported in the atmosphere over several
   hundreds of kilometres, and thus contribute to air quality problems
   further inland, even though they are emitted at sea. In addition, ship
   emissions impact climate. Recent studies indicate that the cooling due
   to altered clouds far outweighs the warming effects from greenhouse
   gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ozone from shipping, overall
   causing a negative present-day radiative forcing (RF). Current efforts
   to reduce sulphur and other pollutants from shipping may modify this.
   However, given the short residence time of sulphate compared to CO2, the
   climate response from sulphate is of the order decades while that of CO2
   is centuries. The climatic trade-off between positive and negative
   radiative forcing is still a topic of scientific research, but from what
   is currently known, a simple cancellation of global mean forcing
   components is potentially inappropriate and a more comprehensive

Abstract = {Understanding long-term, ecosystem-level impacts of climate change is
   challenging because experimental research frequently focuses on
   short-term, individual-level impacts in isolation. We address this
   shortcoming first through an interdisciplinary ensemble of novel
   experimental techniques to investigate the impacts of 14-month exposure
   to ocean acidification and warming (OAW) on the physiology, activity,
   predatory behaviour and susceptibility to predation of an important
   marine gastropod (Nucella lapillus). We simultaneously estimated the
   potential impacts of these global drivers on N. lapillus population
   dynamics and dispersal parameters. We then used these data to
   parameterize a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model, to investigate the
   consequences of OAW on the distribution of the species in the wider NE
   Atlantic region by 2100. The model accounts also for changes in the
   distribution of resources, suitable habitat and environment simulated by
   finely resolved biogeochemical models, under three IPCC global emissions
   scenarios. The experiments showed that temperature had the greatest
   impact on individual-level responses, while acidification had a
   similarly important role in the mediation of predatory behaviour and
   susceptibility to predators. Changes in Nucella predatory behaviour
   appeared to serve as a strategy to mitigate individual-level impacts of
   acidification, but the development of this response may be limited in
   the presence of predators. The model projected significant large-scale
   changes in the distribution of Nucella by the year 2100 that were
   exacerbated by rising greenhouse gas emissions. These changes were
   spatially heterogeneous, as the degree of impact of OAW on the
   combination of responses considered by the model varied depending on
   local-environmental conditions and resource availability. Such changes
   in macro-scale distributions cannot be predicted by investigating
   individual-level impacts in isolation, or by considering climate
   stressors separately. Scaling up the results of experimental climate
   change research requires approaches that account for long-term,
   multiscale responses to multiple stressors, in an ecosystem context.},

Volume = {55},

Pages = {342-352},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic influences on the biosphere since the advent of the
   industrial age are increasingly causing global changes. Climatic change
   and the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are
   ranking high in scientific and public agendas, and other components of
   global change are also frequently addressed, among which are the
   introductions of non indigenous species (NIS) in biogeographic regions
   well separated from the donor region, often followed by spectacular
   invasions. In the marine environment, both climatic change and spread of
   alien,species have been studied extensively; this review is aimed at
   examining the main responses of ecosystems to climatic change, taking
   into account the increasing importance of biological invasions.
   Some general principles on NIS introductions in the marine environment
   are recalled, such as the importance of propagule pressure and of
   development stages during the time course of an invasion. Climatic
   change is known to affect many ecological properties; it interacts also
   with NIS in many possible ways. Direct (proximate) effects on
   individuals and populations of altered physical-chemical conditions are
   distinguished from indirect effects on emergent properties (species
   distribution, diversity, and production). Climatically driven changes
   may affect both local dispersal mechanisms, due to the alteration of
   current patterns, and competitive interactions between NIS and native
   species, due to the onset of new thermal optima and/or different
   carbonate chemistry.
   As well as latitudinal range expansions of species correlated with
   changing temperature conditions, and effects on species richness and the
   correlated extinction of native species, some invasions may provoke
   multiple effects which involve overall ecosystem functioning (material
   flow between trophic groups, primary production, relative extent of
   organic material decomposition, extent of benthic-pelagic coupling).
   Some examples are given, including a special mention of the situation of
   the Mediterranean Sea, where so many species have been introduced
   recently, and where some have spread in very large quantities.
   An increasing effort by marine scientists is required, not only to
   monitor the state of the environment, but also to help predicting future
   changes and finding ways to mitigate or manage them. (C) 2006. Elsevier

Abstract = {Strategies for climate change adaptation are contingent on normative

   aquaculture provides an example of one such adaptation strategy with
   contested unequal outcomes. Focusing on the impacts of adaptation on the

   to technical solutions, can help ensure more equitable outcomes of

Abstract = {Sea level rise is becoming a threat to the coastal areas, and a number
   of coastal cities will face the risk of sea level rise in the near
   future (2050-2100). However, adaptation strategies for coastal areas,
   especially of Turkey, are lacking. This study aims to construct a
   general framework for denoting impacts of sea level rise due to climate
   change in coastal cities and to propose adaptation strategies against
   these effects. It evaluates different aspects and scales, with focus on
   geographical/morphological, administrative and spatial/functional
   aspects and global, regional, national, urban and architectural scales.
   The discussion on the coastal areas is elaborated through the case of
   Turkey. Figured out by the related literature on coastal cities and
   elaborated through the case of Turkey, this comprehensive framework is
   intended to be used also for different coastal cities having a risk of

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most polarized political issues facing the
   American electorate. Even in places like California, where the vast
   majority of the population believes that some action should be taken to
   protect people and property from the effects of climate change,
   Democrats and Republicans disagree on precisely what should be
   protected, the specific adaptive measures that should be taken, and who
   should pay. As warnings of catastrophic damage become louder, however,
   the urgency to find bipartisan solutions will increase. Using a novel
   survey of California adults, our research assesses the current level of
   disagreement over adaptive measures to sea level rise between Democrats
   and Republicans, and asks whether there are conditions under which
   partisans can come to closer agreement on them. Specifically, we
   consider the role of personal experiences in lessening the degree of
   polarization on how partisans think about and prioritize climate
   adaptation. We find that experiencing extreme events does lessen the
   partisan gap in many instances, offering hope that communities can find
   bipartisan solutions to climate change threats.},

Title = {Incorporating blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national
   climate policies},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The emissions reduction pledges made by individual countries through the
   2015 Paris Agreement represent the current global commitment to mitigate
   greenhouse gas emissions in the face of the enduring climate crisis.
   Natural lands carbon sequestration and storage are critical for
   successful pathways to global decarbonization (i. e., as a negative
   emissions technology). Coastal vegetated habitats maintain carbon
   sequestration rates exceeding forest sequestration rates on a per unit
   area basis by nearly two orders of magnitude. These blue carbon habitats
   and their associated carbon sequestration benefits are vulnerable to
   losses from land-use change and sea-level rise. Incorporation of blue
   carbon habitats in climate change policy is one strategy for both
   maintaining these habitats and conserving significant carbon
   sequestration capabilities. Previous policy assessments have found the
   potential for incorporation of coastal carbon sequestration in
   national-level policies, yet there has - to date - been little inclusion
   of blue carbon in the national-scale implementation of Paris
   commitments. Recently, sub national jurisdictions have gained attention
   as models for pathways to decarbonization. However, few previous studies
   have examined sub-national level policy opportunities for
   operationalizing blue carbon into climate decision-making. California is
   uniquely poised to integrate benefits from blue carbon into its coastal
   planning and management and its suite of climate mitigation policies.
   Here, we evaluated legal authorities and policy contexts addressing
   sequestration specifically from blue carbon habitats. We synthesized the
   progressive action in California's approaches to mitigate carbon
   emissions including statutory, regulatory, and non-regulatory
   opportunities to incorporate blue carbon ecosystem service information
   into state-and local-level management decisions. To illustrate how
   actionable blue carbon information can be produced for use in decision
   making, we conducted a spatial analysis of blue carbon sequestration in
   several locations in California across multiple agencies and management
   contexts. We found that the average market values of carbon
   sequestration services in 2100 ranged from \$7,730 to \$44,000 per
   hectare and that the social cost of carbon sequestration value was 1.3
   to 2.7 times the market value. We also demonstrated that restoration of
   small areas with high sequestration rates can be comparable to the
   sequestration of existing marshes. Our results illustrate how accessible
   information about carbon sequestration in coastal habitats can be
   directly incorporated into existing policy frameworks at the
   sub-national scale. The incorporation of blue carbon sequestration
   benefits into sub-national climate policies can serve as a model for the
   development of future policy approaches for negative emissions
   technologies, with consequences for the success of the Paris Agreement
   and science-based decarbonization by mid-century.},

Abstract = {Since 2008 many municipalities in the European Union have taken part in
   the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) initiative and have developed Sustainable
   Energy Action Plans (SEAP) to contribute to climate change mitigation.
   To respond to new policy goals for 2030, the CoM has expanded its focus
   and since 2018 requires municipalities to cover climate adaptation
   actions. The main aim of this paper is to analyse the first experiences
   of six municipalities from Spain, Portugal and Latvia in upgrading their
   existing Sustainable Energy Actions Plans to Sustainable Energy and
   Climate Action Plans (SECAP). SECAPs were developed through a
   participatory process involving all relevant local stakeholders, to gain
   maximum understanding and acceptance. Each municipality implemented
   climate adaption actions to demonstrate the need for adaptation and the
   ways it can be accomplished.},

Abstract = {Climates change impact on salt productions in Pati Regency. The salt
   farmer usually only shifts to aquaculture in the rainy season. Thus,
   while the climate becomes unpredictable, they adapted to extreme weather
   conditions. However, changes in weather such as dryer summers, rain in
   summer, more extended summer season, longer rainy season, and high
   tides. It made the salt production decrease. Salt farmer have their
   adaptation strategies during climate change. This research aims to
   analyze reasons for adaptation strategies regarding climate change. The
   research conducted in Pati Regency from 2011 to 2016. Pati Regency is
   the 3rd most significant salt production area in Indonesia. We
   interviewed the respondents, as well as confirmed the data to other
   farmers, extension officers, and agency officers in the district. The
   data used in this paper are the salt farmer perception is regarding
   climate change and their adaptation strategies. We also used content
   analysis to strengthen our data based on literature and other founding.
   We found that Salt farmers use their strategy to fasten production, such
   as using canvas, black stone, LDPE (Low-Density Poly Ethylene), and HDPE
   (High-Density Poly Ethylene). LDPE and HDPE were introduced by Ministry
   Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) in 2013 and turned out to be very
   helpful for the farmers. The technology introduced by MMAF increased
   production by 14\% and price by 144\% than before while working loads
   become lighter, especially in the harvesting process. Several adaptation
   strategies have implemented in other Regencies, such as MMAF technology.
   However, it still needs continuous persuasion because not all farmers
   wanted to apply it.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to quantify climate-induced increases in morbidity
   rates associated with food- and water-borne illnesses in the context of
   an urban coastal city, taking Beirut-Lebanon as a study area. A Poisson
   generalized linear model was developed to assess the impacts of
   temperature on the morbidity rate. The model was used with four climatic
   scenarios to simulate a broad spectrum of driving forces and potential
   social, economic and technologic evolutions. The correlation established
   in this study exhibits a decrease in the number of illnesses with
   increasing temperature until reaching a threshold of 19.2 degrees C.
   beyond which the number of morbidity cases increases with temperature.
   By 2050, the results show a substantial increase in food- and
   water-borne related morbidity of 16 to 28\% that can reach up to 42\% by
   the end of the century under A1FI (fossil fuel intensive development) or
   can be reversed to similar to 0\% under B1 (lowest emissions
   trajectory). highlighting the need for early mitigation and adaptation

Abstract = {In view of past environmental degradation and anticipated climate change
   impacts, we assessed the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation in the
   Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. In a workshop with staff from three
   Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) who had jurisdiction over three
   sub-basins, as well as technical experts, nine adaptation options were
   identified that ranged from environmental flows, restoring river channel
   habitat, reoperating infrastructure and controlling invasive species. A
   Catchment Adaptation Framework was developed and used to assess and
   compare these adaptation options with each of the CMAs, drawing on
   interviews with their key stakeholders, to identify the risks, benefits
   and costs. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation can augment
   catchment management programs and requires investment in a suite of
   different but complementary measures to lower risk. Our research found
   institutional challenges in implementing this approach, including the
   complexities of multi-agency management, constricting legal
   requirements, narrow funding arrangements, under-developed institutional
   capacity, difficulties of implementing catchment-scale programs on
   private property and the need to adhere to community expectations. These
   institutional issues are ubiquitous internationally and point to the
   wider issues of providing sufficient management capacity to support
   adaptation. The Catchment Adaptation Framework presented here enables
   river basin managers to systematically assess the adaptation options to
   better inform their decision-making.},

Abstract = {One inevitable consequence of climate change is the rising sea level,
   which could adversely affect critical infrastructures in the coastal
   regions. Thirteen percent of the world population and 39\% of the U.S.
   population resides in such coastal regions. Specifically, water
   resources and supporting water infrastructure in many coastal regions
   have become increasingly vulnerable to both quality and capacity issues.
   For example, nuisance-flooding events in low-lying coastal cities and
   salt-water intrusion into drinking water aquifers are becoming more
   frequent occurrences with rising sea levels. Several coastal states have
   already devised and implemented water infrastructure adaptation measures
   to effectively address the current and anticipated challenges of sea
   level rise. This paper presents the preliminary results of a
   comprehensive synthesis of water infrastructure adaptation practices in
   several coastal communities. A detailed review of policy documents
   published by various local, state and federal water infrastructure
   related agencies in the U.S. are reviewed to develop the database of
   water infrastructure adaptation strategies described in this paper.},

Title = {Adaptive management in context of MPAs: Challenges and opportunities for
   implementation},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Worldwide, MPA practitioners are increasing adopting evidence-based
   management over anecdote and intuition. One of the most commonly
   promoted approaches is to monitor the status and trends of performance
   indicators and modify management when the status of an indicator is
   inconsistent with a target. But the challenge with indicator-based
   approaches is interpretation in the absence of an experimental (true or
   quasi) design. A more structured approach with greater inferential
   strength because the implicit adoption of experimental elements into the
   sampling design is the adaptive management approach promoted by Walters
   (1986). Another difference between adaptive management and
   indicator-based approaches is that the latter leads to reactive
   management interventions rather than evaluating alternative management
   options even in the absence of management failure. Unfortunately,
   adaptive management can be challenging to adopt in a scientifically
   rigorous way for at least two reasons. First, the cost to undertake
   large-scale experimental manipulations can be substantial. Second,
   stakeholders, such as commercial fishers or traditional villagers, may
   be unwilling to modify their livelihoods for experimental purposes even
   if learnings may result in more sustainable and cost-effective use of
   resources. As argued convincingly by one proponent of evidence-based
   management, adaptive management may still be applied efficiently to
   routine management activities. Routine management activities inside MPAs
   can include enforcement, raising environmental awareness amongst
   visitors, guiding visitors, installing vessel moorings and developing
   snorkel trails or nature trails through sensitive coastal vegetation.
   Applying adaptive management to these activities could lead to more
   scientifically sound and efficient management outcomes.},

Volume = {1},
Pages = {249-273},
Abstract = {Presently about 40\% of the world's population lives within 100 km of a
   coastline. Climate Change and sea level rise being a relatively new
   policy challenge, experience as to the choice and design of appropriate
   response measures is scarce and fragmented in coastal areas. Increasing
   the availability and transfer of pertinent knowledge across national
   boundaries can assist in furthering coastal safety. This chapter focuses
   on the management of adaptation activities encompassed by the RADOST
   (Regional Adaptation Strategies for the German Baltic Sea Coast) project
   and its international partner regions. Attention is given to the
   operationalization of regional adaptation measures, ways to increase
   resilience, as well as to regional adaptive governance and learning
   processes. Success factors to increase the resilience of coastal areas
   include cooperation of a broad range of organizations and the engagement
   of stakeholders; carefully planning of a sequence of policies and
   measures over time; designating risk areas; revising principles for
   natural resources management along the coasts; awareness raising about
   preferred development practices; and integrating climate concerns with
   other social, economic and environmental objectives. This requires
   maintaining connections to existing policy and decision-making processes
   and building or strengthening partnerships among the relevant sectors of
   the local or regional communities.},

Title = {A review of the species, community, and ecosystem impacts of road salt
   salinisation in fresh waters},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1081-1097},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Freshwater ecosystems worldwide are threatened by salinisation caused
   by human activities. Scientific attention on the ecological impacts of
   salinisation from road deicing salts is increasing exponentially.
   2. Spanning multiple trophic levels and ecosystem types, we review and
   synthesise the ecological impacts of road salt in freshwater ecosystems
   to understand species-, community-, and ecosystem-level responses. In
   our review, we identify knowledge gaps that we hope will motivate future
   research directions.
   3. We found that road salts negatively affect species at all trophic
   levels, from biofilms to fish. The concentration at which road salt
   triggered an effect varied considerably. Species-level impacts were
   generally sub-lethal, leading to reductions in growth and reproduction,
   which can be magnified by natural stressors such as predation.
   Community-level impacts including reductions of biodiversity were
   common, leading to communities of salt-tolerant species, which may have
   implications for disease transmission from enhanced recruitment of
   salt-tolerant host species such as mosquitoes. At the ecosystem level,
   road salts alter nutrient and energy flow. Contaminated wetlands could
   see greater export of greenhouse gases, streams will probably export
   more nitrogen and carbon, and lakes will encounter altered hydrology and
   oxygen dynamics, leading to greater phosphorus release from sediments.
   4. While it is necessary to keep roads safe for humans, the costs to
   freshwater ecosystems may be severe if actions are not taken to mitigate
   road salt salinisation. Cooperation among policy makers, environmental
   managers, transportation professionals, scientists, and the public will
   be crucial to prevent a loss of ecosystem services including water
   clarity, drinkable water, recreation venues, and fisheries.},

   process perspective on coastal flood damage},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {559-576},
Abstract = {In contrast to recent advances in projecting sea levels, estimations
   about the economic impact of sea level rise are vague. Nonetheless, they
   are of great importance for policy making with regard to adaptation and
   greenhouse-gas mitigation. Since the damage is mainly caused by extreme
   events, we propose a stochastic framework to estimate the monetary
   losses from coastal floods in a confined region. For this purpose, we
   follow a Peak-over-Threshold approach employing a Poisson point process
   and the Generalised Pareto Distribution. By considering the effect of
   sea level rise as well as potential adaptation scenarios on the involved
   parameters, we are able to study the development of the annual damage.
   An application to the city of Copenhagen shows that a doubling of losses
   can be expected from a mean sea level increase of only 11 cm. In
   general, we find that for varying parameters the expected losses can be
   well approximated by one of three analytical expressions depending on
   the extreme value parameters. These findings reveal the complex
   interplay of the involved parameters and allow conclusions of
   fundamental relevance. For instance, we show that the damage typically
   increases faster than the sea level rise itself. This in turn can be of
   great importance for the assessment of sea level rise impacts on the
   global scale. Our results are accompanied by an assessment of
   uncertainty, which reflects the stochastic nature of extreme events.
   While the absolute value of uncertainty about the flood damage increases
   with rising mean sea levels, we find that it decreases in relation to
   the expected damage.},

   especially various mitigation and adaptation strategies. Particularly
   the coastal zone will feel the consequences of climate change and the
   associated effects like sea level rise, increased storminess and
   flooding. Thus there is an urgent need for local and regional spatial
   planners to include climate change in their planning efforts. Using
   modelling and simulation, we can increase our understanding of the
   future land-use system under influence of a changing climate and
   accordingly reduce uncertainty concerning decisions. The current paper
   describes how land-use simulations combined with climate change
   scenarios can facilitate the definition of adaptation strategies to
   counteract the consequences of potential climate changes.},

   Impacts, Adaptation Measures, and Implementation Challenges},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Expansive areas of low elevation in many densely populated coastal areas
   are at elevated risk of storm surges and flooding due to torrential
   precipitation, as a result of sea level rise. These phenomena could have
   catastrophic impacts on coastal communities and result in the
   destruction of critical infrastructure, disruption of economic
   activities and salt water contamination of the water supply. The
   objective of the study presented in this paper was to identify various
   impacts of sea level rise on civil infrastructures in coastal areas and
   examine the adaptation measures suggested in the existing literature. To
   this end, a systemic review of the existing literature was conducted in
   order to identify a repository of studies addressing sea level rise
   impacts and adaptation measures in the context of infrastructure
   systems. The study focused on three infrastructure sectors: water and
   wastewater, energy, and road transportation. The collected information
   was then analyzed in order to identify different categories of sea level
   rise impacts and corresponding adaptation measures. The findings of the
   study are threefold: (1) the major categories of sea level rise impacts
   on different infrastructure systems; (2) measures for protection,
   accommodation, and retreat in response to sea level rise impacts; and
   (3) challenges related to implementing adaptation measures.},

   communities under climate change impacts. Considerable research to date
   has focused on the application of risk management in identifying
   vulnerabilities and predicted worst-case scenarios. This approach often
   proposes `hard' infrastructure changes for climate change adaptation.
   However, little work has been done looking at the processes for
   implementing and supporting such adaptation strategies while addressing
   the inherent uncertainty of future climate change impacts. This
   so-called `soft' infrastructure is critical to building a community's
   ability to innovate and prosper while adapting to unforeseen challenges
   posed by a changing climate. It is argued that introducing concepts of
   resilience to municipal planning processes for vulnerable coastal
   settlements, particularly in development control plans (DCP's) may
   provide a more comprehensive approach to climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Exploring the potential of photoluminescence for urban passive cooling
   and lighting applications: A new approach towards materials'
   optimization},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {231},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Different passive strategies are investigated with the aim of reducing
   the overwhelming problem of energy consumption and greenhouse gases
   emissions in the built environment. A careful selection of the urban
   skin can mitigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon and,
   consequently, improve comfort conditions in indoors and outdoors, and
   reduce the ever-increasing energy consumption. In this context, the
   present study aims at investigating innovative cool materials with
   photoluminescent properties that may be exploited to increase energy
   saving thanks to the provided cost-free lighting contribution. A new
   methodology for the analysis of their thermo-optical and photometric
   behavior is proposed, combining existing techniques dedicated to both
   photoluminescence and traditional building materials. The luminous
   samples' performance is experimentally evaluated during both their
   charging and discharging phase. Furthermore, analyses of covariance are
   carried out in order to quantitatively assess the impact of samples'
   composition on their luminous and optical performances. Results
   demonstrate how the latter are mainly influenced by the time of
   excitation and the mixture of chemical compounds, and testify their
   promising potential as cool materials for UHI mitigation and energy
   saving strategy. Both these outcomes pave the way for exploiting and
   scaling up the potential of photoluminescence in highly reflective urban
   skins, with the ability to emit light as reliable passive lighting
   sources. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Limits to autonomous adaptation in response to coastal erosion in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {416-432},
Abstract = {Small-island developing states (SIDS) are particularly vulnerable to the
   effects of climate change, sea level rise and extreme weather events.
   Sea-level rise is expected to exacerbate coastal erosion. Adaptation
   measures in response to this in SIDS have the potential to reduce some
   of the adverse impacts, yet they have limitations. This article
   addresses the degree to which households on the island of Kosrae,
   Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), are affected by coastal erosion,
   the autonomous adaptation measures they have implemented, the
   limitations thereof, and the loss and damage incurred as a result. This
   analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative data. We found that
   70\% of the 363 households we interviewed experienced adverse effects of
   coastal erosion. Of those suffering from impacts, 60\% carried out
   adaptation measures. Yet, 92\% of those respondents who carried out
   adaptation measures indicated that these measures were insufficient,
   resulting in loss and damage to livelihoods, housing and culture. This
   empirical case study contributes to the critical debate on the impacts
   of climate change beyond adaptation.},

Title = {Economic evaluation of climate risk adaptation strategies: Cost-benefit
   analysis of flood protection in Tabasco, Mexico},
Journal = {ATMOSFERA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-120},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Economic losses as a result of natural hazards have been rising over the
   past few decades due to socio-economic development and perhaps climate
   change. This upwards trend is projected to continue, highlighting the
   need for adequate adaptation strategies. This raises the question of how
   to determine which adaptation strategies are preferred to cope with
   uncertain climate change impacts. This study shows how a
   multi-disciplinary cascade of hazard modelling, risk modelling, and a
   cost-benefit analysis can be applied to provide a first indicator of
   economically efficient adaptation strategies. We apply this approach to
   an analysis of flood risk and the desirability of flood protection in
   the state of Tabasco in Mexico, which faces severe flooding on an almost
   yearly basis. The results show that expected annual damage caused by
   coastal flooding is expected to increase from 0.53 billion USD today up
   to 4.12 billion USD in 2080 due to socio-economic development and
   climate change. For river floods, expected annual damages are estimated
   to increase from 1.79 billion USD up to 10.6 billion USD in 2080 if no
   adaptation measures are taken. Based on the estimated risk and
   cost-benefit analysis of installing flood protection infrastructure, we
   determined the economically optimal protection standards for both river
   and coastal floods as at least 100 years, if we take into account
   climate change. Our main conclusions are robust to key uncertainties
   about climate change impacts on flood risks, indirect damage caused by
   floods, the width of the protected floodplains, and the adopted social
   discount rate. We discuss how our multi-disciplinary approach can assist
   policy-makers in decisions about flood risk management, and how future
   research can extend our method to more refined local analyses which are
   needed to guide local adaptation planning.},

Abstract = {Climate change (CC) may have substantial impacts on the distribution of
   current tourist flows by changing patterns of seasonal volumes of
   tourist demand. Such impacts are of potential importance for the Spanish

   preference analysis in the design of CC adaptation policies. Using data
   from the 2005 Familitur Survey on summer domestic tourist flows, a
   destination choice model is implemented to: I) highlight the role of
   temperature and its relationship with other destination-specific
   attributes, 2) estimate CC-induced changes in travel market shares, and
   3) compute the economic value tourists assign to a set of destination
   assets as a way to better permit the recovery the expected market share
   losses by regional tourism authorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Projecting the effects of agricultural conservation practices on stream

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {747},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {How anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of
   present-day agricultural conservation practices remains a key
   uncertainty that could benefit water quality and biodiversity
   conservation planning. To explore this issue, we forecasted how the
   stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would
   respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice
   (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual
   conditions) during 2020-2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation
   Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology
   (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models,
   subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence
   fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models
   predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP
   implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs
   influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects
   outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis
   helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more
   extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied,
   cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also
   are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike,
   smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat forwarm-water, benthic
   species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g.,
   northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to
   increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these
   shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with
   costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing
   opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to
   consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate
   water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological
   modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning
   in a changing climate. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Coastal cities are increasingly vulnerable to flooding and shoreline
   erosion driven by sea-level rise and coastal storm events. Many
   communities face threats of environmental impacts associated with
   industrial development along the Texas coast, which places additional
   stress on residents, infrastructure, and natural resources. Such impacts
   are visible in the case-study for this project, Ingleside on the Bay
   (IOB), Texas, a small community located in close proximity to industrial
   sites in Corpus Christi Bay. In response to sea-level-rise and
   industrial growth in and around IOB, this interdisciplinary research
   project applies a participatory mixed-methods approach to (1) identify
   natural and built assets and challenges based on community input, (2)
   quantify current and future flood hazards, and (3) synthesize these into
   climate adaptation pathways. The resulting adaptation pathways highlight
   the importance of incorporating community input and considering both
   natural and human-caused drivers of vulnerability when evaluating
   potential adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Applying three distinct metrics to measure people's perceptions of
   resilience},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Resilience management is gaining support as resilience studies
   proliferate. Quantification of resilience could help decision makers
   understand the complex dynamics of resilience and adopt resilience
   management. However, most quantifications have focused on resilience as
   an attribute of social-ecological systems, such as thresholds and safe
   operating spaces. Although informative for planning and implementing
   effective resilience management, they do not inform decision makers if
   people accept and support this management. Therefore, it is necessary to
   understand how people perceive resilience. We applied three metrics to
   measure how people perceive resilience: (1) an economic valuation of
   resilience, (2) motivations behind valuing resilience, and (3) the
   relative importance of resilience compared with other ecosystem
   services. We adopted coral reef ecosystems in Okinawa, Japan for our
   analysis. Coral reef ecosystems, which are rich in marine genetic
   resources (hotspots), have become endangered because of increasing
   anthropocentric pressures, and resilience is becoming an accepted method
   in coral reef ecosystem management. Our study revealed that an ex-ante
   willingness to pay (WTP) for expected benefits from a resilience
   management program ranged from 3439 to 5663 JPY for mean WTP and from
   1615 to 2579 JPY for median WTP (cf. 100 JPY = 0.891 USD in 2017).
   Primary motivations, i.e., human values, underlying the valuation of
   resilience were conservation and self-transcendence, which overlap with
   some ecosystem services such as culture, bequest, education, coastal
   protection, sanitation, and habitat. Resilience is highly important
   compared with the other 10 coral reef ecosystem services. These findings
   could help decision makers plan and implement an effective, acceptable,
   and supported resilience management program.},

Abstract = {Climate change is presenting an ongoing and eminent threat to various
   regions, communities and infrastructure worldwide. In this study, the
   current and future climate impacts faced by Viet Nam due to Tropical
   Cyclones (TCs), specifically wind and surge, are evaluated, and
   different adaptation measures to manage this risk are appraised. The
   level of wind and storm surge risk was assessed focusing on three
   categories of assets: residential houses, agriculture, and people. The
   expected damage to these assets was then evaluated based on their
   exposure to the hazard under current and future climate scenarios.
   Physical adaptation measures such as mangroves, sea dykes, and gabions,
   and financial adaptation measures such as risk transfer via insurance
   were applied to the expected future risk and evaluated based on a
   socio-economic cost-benefit analysis. The output will give
   decision-makers the ability to make more informed decisions, prioritize
   the most cost-effective adaptation measures and increase physical and
   financial resilience. The results indicated significant TC exposure in
   future climate scenarios due to economic development and climate change
   that almost doubles the current expected damage. Surge-related damage
   was found to be many times higher than wind damage, and houses had more
   exposure (value in total) than agriculture on a national scale. The
   physical adaptation measures are successful in significantly reducing
   the future wind and especially surge risk and would form a resilient
   strategy along with risk transfer for managing TC risks in the region.},

Title = {CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN NO-TILLAGE SYSTEMS ON TROPICAL SOILS OF BRAZIL},
Booktitle = {NO-TILL FARMING: EFFECTS ON SOIL, PROS AND CONS AND POTENTIAL},
Series = {Agriculture Issues and Policies},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {111-127},
Abstract = {The soil contains a significant part of the global carbon (C) stock:
   3.5\% compared with to 1.7\% in the atmosphere, 8.9\% in fossil fuels,
   1.0\% in biota and 84.9\% in oceans. With increasing emission of
   greenhouse gases (GHG) there is a growing interest in assessing the soil
   role as a C sink in different management conditions. The replacement of
   natural to agricultural ecosystems, with annual crops and based on plow
   tillage has resulted in decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. In
   tropical regions, where high temperatures and rainfall can increase the
   soil degradation, the use of no tillage (NT) can reverse this process,
   favoring the recovery of SOC, decreasing CO2 emissions, and hence
   reducing the greenhouse effect. The widespread use of the NT in Brazil
   is characterized by sowing on to the crop residues from the previous
   cultivation, without any soil preparation. The dead biomass formed by
   the crop residues accumulated on the topsoil can help reduce erosion,
   temperature and moisture fluctuations at the surface, and the crops
   exposure to drought. These characteristics result in chemical, physical
   and biological alterations in soil properties affecting nutrient uptake
   by crops. In Brazil, the soils are dominated by variable-charge clay
   minerals such as kaolinite and, especially, Fe and Al oxides, which have
   a high flocculation capacity due to electrostatic interactions through
   their positive charges. The strong adsorption of SOC to active Al and Fe
   oxides is the cause for SOC stability in tropical soils; therefore, the
   interaction of organic compounds with clay in highly weathered oxidic
   soils can prevent SOC losses. In this context, soil C sequestration is a
   significant option to mitigate GHG emission in Brazilian tropical
   conditions},

Title = {Accelerated Sea-Level Rise Limits Vegetation Capacity to Sequester Soil
   Carbon in Coastal Wetlands: A Study Case in Southeastern Australia},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Estimates of global carbon stocks in coastal wetlands reveal that these
   are some of the most efficient carbon-sequestering environments in the
   world, which has prompted a renewed interest in conservation and
   restoration programs as an opportunity for greenhouse gas abatement.
   Accumulation of carbon in coastal wetlands is linked to diverse factors
   such as the type of vegetation, geomorphic setting, and sediment supply.
   Feedbacks between these factors and the tidal flow conditions drive the
   dynamics of carbon accumulation rates. Climate change-induced sea-level
   rise has been shown to increase the vulnerability to submergence of
   saltmarsh and mangroves in coastal wetlands, even if accommodation and
   landward colonization are possible. These potential losses of wetland
   vegetation combined with the reduced productivity of newly colonized
   areas will directly affect the capacity of the wetlands to sequester
   carbon from sediments and root growth. Here, we implement an
   eco-geomorphic model to simulate vegetation dynamics, soil carbon
   accumulation, and changes in soil carbon stock for a restored
   mangrove-saltmarsh wetland experiencing accelerated sea-level rise. We
   evaluate model outcomes for existing conditions and two different
   management scenarios aimed at mitigating sea-level rise effects and
   conserve wetland vegetation. Even though some management measures can
   result in partial conservation of wetland vegetation, they do not
   necessarily result in the best option for soil carbon capture. Our
   results suggest that accelerated sea-level can trigger accelerated
   wetland colonization resulting in wetland areas with limited
   opportunities for soil carbon capture from sediment and root
   mineralization, an issue that has not been considered in previous
   studies.},

Title = {Damming deltas: A practice of the past? Towards nature-based flood

Year = {2014},
Volume = {140},

Abstract = {There is extensive experience in adaptive management of exposed sandy
   coastlines through sand nourishment for coastal protection. However, in
   complex estuarine systems, coastlines are often shortened through
   damming estuaries to achieve desired safety levels. The Dutch Deltaworks
   illustrate that this approach disrupts natural sediment fluxes and harms
   ecosystem health, which negatively affects derived ecosystem services,
   such as freshwater availability and mussel and oyster farming. This
   heavily impacts local communities and thus requires additional
   maintenance and management efforts. Nevertheless, the discussion on
   coastline shortening keeps surfacing when dealing with complex coastal
   management issues throughout the world. Although adaptive delta
   management accompanied by innovative approaches that integrate coastal
   safety with ecosystem services is gaining popularity, it is not yet
   common practice to include adaptive pathways, a system-based view and
   ecosystem knowledge into coastal management projects. Here, we provide a
   first attempt to integrate ecosystem-based flood risk reduction measures
   in the standard suite of flood risk management solutions, ranging from
   structural to non-structural. Additionally, for dealing with the dynamic
   and more unpredictable nature of ecosystems, we suggest the adaptive
   delta management approach that consists of flexible measures, measurable
   targets, monitoring and intervention, as a framework for embedding
   ecosystem-based alternatives for flood risk mitigation in the daily
   practice of engineers and coastal planners. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {It is increasingly evident that climate change is having significant
   impacts on marine ecosystems and dependent fisheries. Yet, translating
   climate science into management actions and policies is an ongoing
   challenge. In particular, four aspects have confounded implementation of
   climate-resilient management: (i) regional management tools may not be
   well-suited for managing the same systems under climate change, (ii)
   individual management policies and climate research studies are often
   implicitly focussed on spatio-temporal scales that are rarely aligned,
   (iii) management approaches seldom integrate across spatio-temporal
   scales and are, therefore, maladapted to unidirectional change and
   extreme events, and (iv) challenges to modelling socio-economic
   implications of climate change impede projections of cumulative costs to
   society, disguise adaptive limits, and ultimately impact climate risk
   and management trade-off assessments. We suggest that addressing
   environmental change favours adaptive and dynamic management approaches,
   while addressing shifting socio-economic and political conditions
   favours fixed long-term measures; considering both jointly requires a
   combination of dynamic-adaptive-fixed approaches. We outline a framework
   to integrate climate-responsive tools into a unified climate-resilient
   management approach using nested dynamic-adaptive-fixed management
   portfolios that improve management effectiveness and efficiency. This
   approach may help reduce future conflict between marine resource
   extractive and conservation goals through more explicit characterization
   of management trade-offs and identification of social and ecological
   tipping points.},

Abstract = {This study conducts the first systematic literature review of climate
   change adaptation in aquaculture. We address three specific questions:
   (i) What is aquaculture adapting to? (ii) How is aquaculture adapting?
   and (iii) What research gaps need to be addressed? We identify,
   characterise and examine case studies published between 1990 and 2018
   that lie at the intersection of the domains of climate change,
   adaptation and aquaculture. The main areas of documented climate change
   impacts relate to extreme events and the general impacts of climate
   change on the aquaculture sector. Three categories of adaptation to
   climate change are identified: coping mechanisms at the local level
   (e.g. water quality management techniques), multilevel adaptive
   strategies (e.g. changing culture practices) and management approaches
   (e.g. adaptation planning, community-based adaptation). We identify four
   potential areas for future research: research on inland aquaculture
   adaptation; studies at the household level; whether different groups of
   aquaculture farmers (e.g. indigenous people) face and adapt differently
   to climate change; and the use of GIS and remote sensing as
   cost-effective tools for developing adaptation strategies and responses.
   The study brings essential practical and theoretical insights to the
   aquaculture industry as well as to climate change adaptation research
   across the globe.},

   coast erosion in Latvia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {238-249},
Abstract = {Purpose - In addition to climate changes, human activities in the sea
   coast area are also important in the context of coastal erosion. There
   is a need to consider possible measures of adaptation at a national
   level to solve this issue. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the
   findings of the interviews made by the author and come to conclusions
   about residents' attitude towards possible measures of adaptation to the
   coastal erosion in Latvia.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research was made by interviewing
   those seashore residents whose households are most influenced by sea
   coast erosion along the entire coastline of Latvia in the areas where
   erosion rate is projected to be at least 6 m until the year of 2025.
   Findings - Half of the interviewees consider hard coast defense
   structures as an effective adaptation measure to the sea coast erosion
   in households concerned. The other half would not support that because
   of either long-term ineffectiveness or other unwilling consequences.
   Retreat as a strategy is acceptable only for quite a small part of
   interviewees.
   Originality/value - The results of the research can be taken into
   consideration when making political decisions concerning adaptation to
   climate change.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {149},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {29-41},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The planning and phasing of adaptation responses are essential to tackle
   uncertainties and ensure positive outcomes while adapting to changing
   circumstances. Understanding the evolution of coping and adaptation
   responses and their capacities is a prerequisite for preparing an
   effective flood management plan for the future. The aim of this paper is
   to determine the effect of coping capacity on longer term adaptation
   responses in a flood risk management system. The objectives,
   requirements, targets, design, and performance of flood protection
   measures will have to be determined after taking into account, or in
   conjunction with, the coping capacities. A methodology has been
   developed and demonstrated based on an adaptation pathway approach to
   account for coping capacities and to assess the effect of these on flood
   protection measures. Application of this methodology for flood
   protection measures in Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta shows the effect
   of considering coping capacity for flood protection measures and the
   value in delaying the occurrence of tipping points. Coping measures such
   as elevating property floor levels can postpone the tipping points when
   dikes are no longer effective. Consideration of coping capacity in the
   system improves adaptation responses and leads to better adaptation
   outcomes.},

Title = {Climate Change Projections in CESM1(CAM5) Compared to CCSM4},

Pages = {6287-6308},

Abstract = {Future climate change projections for phase 5 of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are presented for the Community Earth
   System Model version 1 that includes the Community Atmospheric Model
   version 5 {[}CESM1(CAM5)]. These results are compared to the Community
   Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) and include simulations using
   the representative concentration pathway (RCP) mitigation scenarios, and
   extensions for those scenarios beyond 2100 to 2300. Equilibrium climate
   sensitivity of CESM1(CAM5) is 4.10 degrees C, which is higher than the
   CCSM4 value of 3.20 degrees C. The transient climate response is 2.33
   degrees C, compared to the CCSM4 value of 1.73 degrees C. Thus, even
   though CESM1(CAM5) includes both the direct and indirect effects of
   aerosols (CCSM4 had only the direct effect), the overall climate system
   response including forcing and feedbacks is greater in CESM1(CAM5)
   compared to CCSM4. The Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation
   (AMOC) in CESM1(CAM5) weakens considerably in the twenty-first century
   in all the RCP scenarios, and recovers more slowly in the lower forcing
   scenarios. The total aerosol optical depth (AOD) changes from similar to
   0.12 in 2006 to similar to 0.10 in 2100, compared to a preindustrial
   1850 value of 0.08, so there is less negative forcing (a net positive
   forcing) from that source during the twenty-first century. Consequently,
   the change from 2006 to 2100 in aerosol direct forcing in CESM1(CAM5)
   contributes to greater twenty-first century warming relative to CCSM4.
   There is greater Arctic warming and sea ice loss in CESM1(CAM5), with an
   ice-free summer Arctic occurring by about 2060 in RCP8.5 (2040s in
   September) as opposed to about 2100 in CCSM4 (2060s in September).},

   management of coral reefs},
Journal = {PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {126-132},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are one of the ecosystems most sensitive to climate change.
   The recent loss and degradation of coral reef ecosystems is expected to
   continue even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees C above
   pre-industrial levels. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new
   technologies and management approaches to coral reef conservation.
   Emerging technologies, however, bring new challenges for decision making
   as they are associated with novel risks and impacts on the reef system.
   We argue that accounting for multiple biophysical thresholds and
   identifying key decisions in the planning process are crucial to avoid
   perverse outcomes in coral reef conservation. We identify opportunities
   to apply an Adaptation Pathways (AP) framework combined with a `values,
   rules and knowledge' approach to facilitate long-term and large-scale
   coral reef conservation by explicitly considering uncertainty with
   climate change impacts in the decision-making process. The AP process
   can be used to reconcile the diverse values of stakeholders, scientific
   and cultural knowledge about the system, and the policy and regulatory
   context within which management must occur, in order to achieve robust
   long-term management.},

Abstract = {Geological CO2 sequestration is an effective approach to mitigate
   greenhouse gas emissions by permanently trapping CO2 in the subsurface.
   A large portion of injected CO2 is trapped by capillary forces in pores
   and eventually dissolves into the reservoir brine due to convective
   mixing to achieve permanent entrapment. In regions where convective
   mixing is slow, non-convective transport can play an important role in
   redistributing residually trapped CO2, but the mechanisms and timescales
   for redistribution have yet to be explored thoroughly. In previous work,
   we have shown that capillary pressure difference among residually
   trapped gas ganglia can induce Ostwald ripening, thereby redistributing
   the separate-phase gas through diffusion despite the gas phase remaining
   trapped over the entire course of equilibration. In this study, we show
   from a thermodynamic point of view that other natural gradients in
   geologic formations- hydrostatic pressure, geothermal gradients and
   capillary heterogeneity-can also redistribute CO2 by non-convective
   transport. Mechanisms for resulting non-convective transport include
   molecular diffusion, the sedimentation effect and potentially the Soret
   effect. Results show that hydrostatic pressure dominates redistribution
   such that the separate-phase gas is transported upward through molecular
   diffusion and accumulates under the seal at the steady state. A typical
   timescale for gas phase redistribution is 10(5) years/m; for a
   100-m-thick formation, redistribution is complete after similar to 10(7)
   years. Although non-convective transport is an extremely slow process,
   it causes local accumulation of the gas phase and in some settings may
   remobilize the trapped gas phase.},

Title = {Understanding the Local Perception, Adaptation to Climate Change and
   Resilience Planning Among the Farmers of Semi-Arid Tracks of South India},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {People all around the world have come into a consensus on climate change
   that is a fact with an increasing number of unusual climate-related
   events and extremities. The present study is an attempt to explore the
   views of local farmers on climate change and uncertainty and evaluating
   their prevalent coping strategies in the Chengalpet district of Tamil
   Nadu, a semi-arid expanse of South India. In order to achieve this
   objective, Rapid Rural Appraisals (RRAs), Focal Group Discussions (FGDs)
   and In-Depth Surveys (IDS) were conducted. Through RRA, this research
   identifies farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts and
   highlights how farmers respond to it through adaptations and brings to
   light the adaptation needs and obstacles faced by the vulnerable coastal
   agro ecosystems of the state. The study indicated that majority of the
   farmers have observed climatic variability and change through rises in
   temperature, extended dry spells, rise in heat stress on crops, etc. The
   study explored that the farmers are practicing autonomous adaptation
   strategies like varying planting dates, adoption of heat resistant crops
   and varieties, switch from conventional paddy cultivation to other cash
   crops, agroforestry, etc. Farmers are cultivating tree species such as
   eucalyptus, teak wood, Casuarinafor multipurpose use planted along with
   various annual crops like cereals, banana, jasmine, cluster beans,
   maize, etc. This supports them to abate short term risks, sustain their
   livelihood and works as a long-term investment. The farmers are facing
   various social hurdles to adaptation options like lack of timely
   information regarding effective adaptation options from extension
   officers, lack of crop-weather insurances and micro-financing
   facilities, etc., apart from climate change risks. With regards to the
   sources of information regarding adaptation options, there is a strong
   need to enhance agriculture extension services in the remote areas. SWOT
   analysis revealed dwindling crop area for cultivation/natural resources,
   poor dissemination of weather/climate forecasts, reluctance of the young
   generation to take up farming as their living, etc., as some of the
   major threats. In order to prioritize the best and viable adaptation
   that suits, the research zone pairwise ranking method was used. This
   study recommends modification of farming practices, switching over to
   different crops and efficient water management as site-specific
   adaptation interventions as per pair-wise ranking of adaptations. These
   site specific strategies have to be implemented in the region to meet
   the challenges that lie ahead due to future climatic change and
   livelihood insecurity.},

   World's Largest Mangrove Ecosystem},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal river delta and the
   largest uninterrupted mangrove ecosystem. A complex socio-ecological
   setting, coupled with disproportionately high climate-change exposure
   and severe ecological and social vulnerabilities, has turned it into a
   climate hotspot requiring well-designed adaptation interventions. We
   have used the fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM)-based approach to elicit and
   integrate stakeholders' perceptions regarding current climate forcing,
   consequent impacts, and efficacy of the existing adaptation measures. We
   have also undertaken climate modelling to ascertain long-term future
   trends of climate forcing. FCM-based simulations reveal that while
   existing adaptation practices provide resilience to an extent, they are
   grossly inadequate in the context of providing future resilience. Even
   well-planned adaptations may not be entirely transformative in such a
   fragile ecosystem. It was through FCM-based simulations that we realised
   that a coastal river delta in a developing nation merits special
   attention for climate-resilient adaptation planning and execution.
   Measures that are likely to enhance adaptive capabilities of the local
   communities include those involving gender-responsive and adaptive
   governance, human resource capacity building, commitments of global
   communities for adaptation financing, education and awareness
   programmes, and embedding indigenous and local knowledge into decision
   making.},

   Adaptation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal climate change impacts challenge policy and decision makers to
   adopt more effective adaptation measures. The ecosystem-based management
   approach can shift adaptation towards a more holistic, integrated and
   sustainable path. However, as countries work on strategies to adapt to
   climate change, the questions of if and how such agendas consider and
   operationalise ecosystem-based management remains. As one of the world's
   largest coastal countries, Brazil can have a prominent role in advancing
   the implementation of ecosystem-based management to coastal zones. By
   analysing two national Brazilian climate change adaptation institutions,
   this article evaluates and discusses the country's advances in promoting
   climate change adaptations based on ecosystem-based management
   principles. Our findings show that, although Brazil has incorporated
   many ecosystem-based management principles to climate change adaptation
   at the national level, greater attention should be given to
   operationalizing principles related to acknowledging uncertainties,
   sustainability, democracy and knowledge production and application. The
   challenges to implement these principles mirror historical challenges of
   Brazilian coastal management policies, such as balancing development and
   conservation, promoting social participation and implementing effective
   social-ecological assessments and monitoring programs. Policy makers,
   scientists and communities should be aware of the need to strengthen
   ecosystem-based management principles in the current adaptation agenda
   in order to enhance its capacity to foster adaptation and just coastal
   sustainability.},

Title = {Generic adaptation pathways for coastal archetypes under uncertain
   sea-level rise},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Adaptation to coastal flood risk is hampered by high uncertainty in the
   rate and magnitude of sea-level rise. Subsequently, adaptation decisions
   carry strong risks of under- or over-investment, and could lead to
   costly retrofitting or unnecessary high margins. To better allocate
   resources timely and effectively, and achieve long-term sustainability,
   planners could utilise adaptation pathways, revealing the
   path-dependencies of adaptation options. This helps to identify
   low-regret short-term decisions that preserve options in an uncertain
   future, while monitoring to detect signals to adapt. A major barrier to
   the application of adaptation pathways is limited experience. To
   facilitate this, here we generalize this pathways approach for six
   common coastal archetypes, resulting in generic pathways suitable to be
   adjusted to local conditions. This provides a much richer analysis of
   coastal adaptation than provided by any previous analysis, by assessing
   the solution space and options over time for a variety of coastal
   regions. Based on this analysis, we find that the number of adaptation
   options declines while sea-level rises. For some archetypes, it becomes
   clear that long-term thinking is needed now, about if, how and when to
   move to transformative options, such as planned retreat, which may
   presently not be considered or acceptable. Our analysis further shows
   that coastal adaptation needs to start earlier than anticipated,
   especially given time required for local debate and choice and to
   implement measures.},

Title = {The roles of governments and other actors in adaptation to climate

Journal = {AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {There is little question now about the reality of climate change and the
   importance of adaptation of human activities in reducing the negative
   impacts of climate change and variability (CCV) as well as the reduction
   of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in mitigating this unprecedented phenomenon.
   This article focuses on adaptation and the adaptive capacity of actors
   (decision-takers) of all sorts to adopt appropriate strategies and
   increase their adaptive capacity to cope with CCV by focusing on two
   types of human activity-agriculture and agricultural territories and
   coastal communities, both of which have very important roles to play in
   human society. Given the recent high profile given to the outcomes of
   COP21 and particularly the potential transfer of significant funding
   from developed to developing countries to support their battle against
   CCV, the emphasis has shifted again to the role of governments in this
   battle. We argue that governments have important roles to play both in
   developed and developing countries, but supporting funding of
   initiatives and for developing pertinent action plans is probably the
   least of our worries! Funding can be important but alone does not solve
   the challenges, it is what is accomplished with funding that is all
   important, and this requires the development of effective and pertinent
   adaptive capacities on the part of the different actors involved in what
   becomes a co-construction process. We argue that the roles of
   governments and other actors (collective as well as individual citizens
   and the activities that they are involved in) need to be better
   understood in order for this to happen. This is illustrated by research
   of different types on agriculture and coastal communities.},

Title = {Financing and implementation of adaptation measures to climate change
   along the Spanish coast},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {712},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Understanding how we are adapting to climate change in coastal areas is
   an essential issue in the long-term coastal planning. While most of
   existing studies focus on mapping the current state of adaptation plans,
   there is a significant lack of studies on the current implementation of
   adaptation strategies. This study addresses this challenge by assessing
   how coastal adaptation is being financed and implemented in Spain. In
   the absence of a detailed roadmap for implementing the Spanish Strategy
   for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change, we have analysed how
   adaptation has been and is currently being funded; which the rationale
   for investments along the territory is; how adaptation investments
   compare to regular coastal protection costs; and assessed when
   implemented measures are really adaptation ones Our results show that
   the financing source clearly conditions the type of measures
   implemented, with those funded under the Environment Promotion Plan for
   Climate Change Adaptation (PIMA Adapta initiative) being dominated by
   classical coastal engineering actions, whereas ecosystem-related actions
   are mostly funded under the LIFE programme. In territorial terms, the
   Mediterranean coastal regions present the most important problems under
   current conditions and attract most of the funding. Most of the funded
   actions have been designed to solve current coastal problems, and
   although they indirectly contribute to adaptation by improving the
   coastal base status, they are not specifically designed for climate
   change. This misuse of the concept of adaptation measure will tend to
   the society to be overconfident about adopted actions whereas we are not
   progressing to real adaptation. To overcome this risk, it is necessary
   to have a clear roadmap for implementing adaptation measures together a
   proper financing structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {VIE index is a tool to assess vulnerability of residential houses for
   people in case of flood. It aims to evaluate a potential number of
   deaths in ``dangerous houses{''} due to configuration and location of
   buildings. It allows to conduct cost-efficiency analysis of adaptation
   strategies to protect human lives.
   Successfully applied to seven municipalities impacted by Storm Xynthia
   (2010, in France), some limitations were identified as the index was
   only designed for centennial floods or the cost-efficiency was conducted
   comparing strategies one after the other.
   This paper shows that (i) preventionwarning and evacuation appears to be
   the only strategy for which efficiency increases with the flood
   intensity and that (ii) mixing adaptation strategies allows to enhance
   efficiency and decrease costs.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation in a Mediterranean Semi-Arid Catchment:
   Testing Managed Aquifer Recharge and Increased Surface Reservoir
   Capacity},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Among different uses of freshwater, irrigation is the most impacting
   groundwater resource, leading to water table depletion and possible
   seawater intrusion. The unbalance between the availability of water
   resources and demand is currently exacerbated and could become worse in
   the near future in accordance with climate change observations and
   scenarios provided by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
   In this context, Increasing Maximum Capacity of the surface reservoir
   (IMC) and Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) are adaptation measures that
   have the potential to enhance water supply systems resiliency. In this
   paper, a multiple-users and multiple-resources-Water Supply System (WSS)
   model is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of these two
   adaptation strategies in a context of overexploited groundwater under
   the RCP 4.5 and the RCP 8.5 IPCC scenarios. The presented a case study
   that is located in the Puglia, a semi-arid region of South Italy
   characterized by a conspicuous water demand for irrigation. We observed
   that, although no significant long-term trend affects the proposed
   precipitation scenarios, the expected temperature increase highly
   impacts the WSS resources due to the associated increase of water demand
   for irrigation purposes. Under the RCP 4.5 the MAR scenario results are
   more effective than the IMC during long term wet periods (typically 5
   years) and successfully compensates the impact on the groundwater
   resources. Differently, under RCP 8.5, due to more persistent dry
   periods, both adaptation scenarios fail and groundwater resource become
   exposed to massive sea water intrusion during the second half of the
   century. We conclude that the MAR scenario is a suitable adaptation
   strategy to face the expected future changes in climate, although
   mitigation actions to reduce green-house gases are strongly required.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {24},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {It has been understood that production of hydrogen from fossil and
   carbonaceous fuels with reduced CO2 emission to the atmosphere is key to
   the production of hydrogen-rich fuels for mitigating the CO2 greenhouse
   gas climate change problem. The conventional methods of hydrogen
   production from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas and biomass) include steam
   reforming and water gas shift mainly of natural gas (SRM). In order to
   suppress CO2 emission from the steam reforming process, CO2 must be
   concentrated and sequestered either in or under the ocean or in or
   underground tin aquifers, or depleted oil or gas wells). Up to about
   40\% of the energy is lost in this process. An alternative process is
   the pyrolysis or the thermal decomposition of methane, natural gas (TDM)
   to hydrogen and carbon. The carbon can either be sequestered or sold on
   the market as a materials commodity or used as a fuel at a later date
   under less severe CO2 restraints. The energy sequestered in the carbon
   amounts to about 42\% of the energy in the natural gas resource which is
   stored and not destroyed. A comparison is made between the well
   developed conventional SRM and the less developed TDM process including
   technological status, efficiency, carbon management and cost. The TDM
   process appears to have advantages over the well developed SRM process.
   It is much easier to sequester carbon as a stable solid than CO2 as a
   reactive gas or low temperature liquid. It is also possible to reduce
   cost by marketing the carbon as a filler or construction material, The
   potential benefits of the TDM process justifies its further efficient
   development. The hydrogen can be used as a transportation fuel or
   converted to methanol by reaction with CO2 from fossil fuel fired power
   plant stack gases, thus allowing reuse of the carbon in conventional IC
   automobile engines or in advanced fuel cell vehicles. (C) 1999

Title = {Evaluating a multispecies adaptive management framework: must
   uncertainty impede effective decision-making?},

Abstract = {Application of adaptive management to complex natural resource systems
   requires careful evaluation to ensure that the process leads to improved
   decision-making. As part of that evaluation, adaptive policies can be
   compared with alternative nonadaptive management scenarios. Also, the
   value of reducing structural (ecological) uncertainty to achieving
   management objectives can be quantified.
   A multispecies adaptive management framework was recently adopted by the
   Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission for sustainable harvest of
   Delaware Bay horseshoe crabs Limulus polyphemus, while maintaining
   adequate stopover habitat for migrating red knots Calidris canutus rufa,
   the focal shorebird species. The predictive model set encompassed the
   structural uncertainty in the relationships between horseshoe crab
   spawning, red knot weight gain and red knot vital rates. Stochastic
   dynamic programming was used to generate a state-dependent strategy for
   harvest decisions given that uncertainty. In this paper, we employed a
   management strategy evaluation approach to evaluate the performance of
   this adaptive management framework. Active adaptive management was used
   by including model weights as state variables in the optimization and
   reducing structural uncertainty by model weight updating.
   We found that the value of information for reducing structural
   uncertainty is expected to be low, because the uncertainty does not
   appear to impede effective management. Harvest policy responded to
   abundance levels of both species regardless of uncertainty in the
   specific relationship that generated those abundances. Thus, the
   expected horseshoe crab harvest and red knot abundance were similar when
   the population generating model was uncertain or known, and harvest
   policy was robust to structural uncertainty as specified.
   Synthesis and applications.The combination of management strategy
   evaluation with state-dependent strategies from stochastic dynamic
   programming was an informative approach to evaluate adaptive management
   performance and value of learning. Although natural resource decisions
   are characterized by uncertainty, not all uncertainty will cause
   decisions to be altered substantially, as we found in this case. It is
   important to incorporate uncertainty into the decision framing and
   evaluate the effect of reducing that uncertainty on achieving the
   desired outcomes.},

Title = {Improving cross-sectoral climate change adaptation for coastal
   settlements: insights from South East Queensland, Australia},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts affecting coastal areas, such as sea-level rise
   and storm surge events, are expected to have significant social,
   economic and environmental consequences worldwide. Ongoing population
   growth and development in highly urbanised coastal areas will exacerbate
   the predicted impacts on coastal settlements. Improving the adaptation
   potential of highly vulnerable coastal communities will require greater
   levels of planning and policy integration across sectors and scales.
   However, to date, there is little evidence in the literature which
   demonstrates how climate policy integration is being achieved. This
   paper contributes to this gap in knowledge by drawing on the example
   provided by the process of developing cross-sectoral climate change
   adaptation policies and programmes generated for three coastal
   settlement types as part of the South East Queensland Climate Adaptation
   Research Initiative (SEQCARI), a 3-year multi-sectoral study of climate
   change adaptation options for human settlements in South East
   Queensland, Australia. In doing so, we first investigate the benefits
   and challenges to cross-sectoral adaptation to address climate change
   broadly and in coastal areas. We then describe how cross-sectoral
   adaptation policies and programmes were generated and appraised
   involving the sectors of urban planning and management, coastal
   management, emergency management, human health and physical
   infrastructure as part of SEQCARI. The paper concludes by discussing key
   considerations that can inform the development and assessment of
   cross-sectoral climate change adaptation policies and programmes in
   highly urbanised coastal areas.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {233},
Pages = {291-301},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Resilience underpins the sustainability of both ecological and social
   systems. Extensive loss of reef corals following recent mass bleaching
   events have challenged the notion that support of system resilience is a
   viable reef management strategy. While resilience-based management (RBM)
   cannot prevent the damaging effects of major disturbances, such as mass
   bleaching events, it can support natural processes that promote
   resistance and recovery. Here, we review the potential of RBM to help
   sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for
   supporting resilience through existing management approaches and
   emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in
   a changing climate. We argue that for RBM to be effective in a changing
   world, reef management strategies need to involve both existing and new
   interventions that together reduce stress, support the fitness of
   populations and species, and help people and economies to adapt to a
   highly altered ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Global warming, also referred to as climate change, is the observed
   century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth and its
   related effects. Many scientific studies show that the climate system is
   warming. In 2013, the Fifth Assessment Report issued by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that ``It is
   extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the
   observed warming since the mid-20th century{''}. The largest human
   influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon
   dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to
   region around the globe. Negative effects include increasing global
   temperatures, rising sea levels, changing precipitation, and expansion
   of deserts in the subtropics. Warming is expected to be greater over the
   land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic, with the
   continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Other likely
   changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves,
   droughts, heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall, ocean
   acidification, and species extinctions due to shifting of temperature
   regimes.
   Considering the increase in extreme meteorological events related to
   this global warming, in the absence of preventive actions, climate
   change is likely to make the national energy infrastructure increasingly
   vulnerable. Considering this critical situation, the Italian Regulatory
   Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water System (AEEGSI) asked the
   Italian TSO (TERNA) and all the DSOs serving a minimum of 50.000
   consumers to work jointly for the implementation of the first National
   Resilience Plan (NRP).
   In particular, with Article 37 of Annex A of the Deliberation 653/2015/
   R/eel and with the Resolution 2/2017-DIEU ``Guidelines for Presentation
   of Work Plans{''}, the AEEGSI requested that this first NRP should focus
   on the resilience of the national grid referring to intense ice and snow
   events of the last 15 years.
   With a unique transparent process of involving stakeholders1 at every
   step, an ad-hoc round table lead by Terna has been launched to discuss
   in more details practical approaches, to build common position on
   specific objectives and the methodology.
   On March 2017, Terna successfully released the first version of the NRP
   structured as follow:
   The first section provides an analysis of the extreme events of the last
   years that have caused difficulties in the daily operation of the
   national transmission grid;
   The second section presents the definition of the Resilience of the
   grid;
   The third section reports the main different technological solutions for
   the resilience increase;
   Finally, in the last section, it's described how the methodology is
   applied and which are the technical solution identified by Terna in each
   critical area.},

Title = {Using urban climate modelling and improved land use classifications to
   support climate change adaptation in urban environments: A case study
   for the city of Klagenfurt, Austria},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {This study outlines the results of current and future climate scenarios,
   and potentially realizable climate adaptation measures, for the city of
   Klagenfurt, Austria. For this purpose, we used the microscale urban
   climate model (MUKLIMO\_3), in conjunction with the cuboid method, to
   calculate climate indices such as the average number of summer and hot
   days per year. For the baseline simulation, we used meteorological
   measurements from 1981 to 2010 from the weather station located at
   Klagenfurt Airport. Individual building structures and canopy cover from
   several land monitoring services were used to derive accurate properties
   for land use classes in the study domain. To characterize the
   effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies, we compared changes in
   the climate indices for several (future) climate adaptation scenarios to
   the reference simulation. Specifically, we considered two major
   adaptation pathways: (i) an increase in the albedo values of sealed
   areas (i.e., roofs, walls and streets) and (ii) an increase in green
   surfaces (i.e., lawns on streets and at roof level) and high vegetated
   areas (i.e., trees). The results indicate that some climate adaptation
   measures show higher potential in mitigating hot days than others,
   varying between reductions of 2.3 to 11.0\%. An overall combination of
   adaptation measures leads to a maximum reduction of up to 44.0\%,
   indicating a clear potential for reduction/mitigation of urban heat
   loads. Furthermore, the results for the future scenarios reveal the
   possibility to remain at the current level of urban heat load during the
   daytime over the next three decades for the overall combination of
   measures.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal areas globally suffer from serious erosion and sedimentation
   problems. The assessment of coastal erosion risk is fundamental for
   better coastal management. The main goal of the current study was to
   enhance coastal management by identifying the coastal erosion risk and
   suggest possible mitigation measures. The study was developed for the
   Egyptian Northern Coast. MIKE 21 was used to evaluate the erosion and
   test the proposed measures. First, a bathymetric survey of the study
   area was conducted. Then the tidal data, storm surge, and global sea
   rise data were collected. The offshore wave data, shoreline data were
   compiled. And then, the different nearshore wave modeling and wave
   propagation were modeled. The model was calibrated using measured data
   in 2014 and validated using measured data in 2016. Future shoreline
   changes for the years 2029, 2039, and 2049 were depicted. A suitable
   mitigation measure was used and tested for the same years. The groins
   with a specific size and arrangement were tested. The main goal of the
   study is to find a suitable solution to protect the coast and
   investigate its impact on the shoreline in the next 30 years. The
   proposed mitigation measure minimized the coastal erosion of the study
   area rigorously. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on

Abstract = {A large part of the Central Asian region is located within the inner
   flow of the Aral Sea basin. The water resources are formed from renewed
   superficial and underground waters of natural origin, and also with
   returnable waters. The intensive increase of water intake, that took
   place in the second half of the twentieth century caused practically
   complete assimilation of the river inflow. That was the main reason for
   the Aral Sea crisis. On the basis of the analysis of long periodical
   rows of observation by meteorological and hydrological stations, the
   estimation of regional water resources and calculations of changes of
   some components of the hydrological cycle due to the expected climate
   changes are presented. Measures for adaptation in the southern part of
   the Aral Sea region are considered.},

Abstract = {In the last couple of decades cool roofs, i.e. roof surfaces exposed to
   solar radiation characterized by high solar reflectance (albedo) and
   thermal emittance, are being intensively studied for their ability to
   reduce the roof temperature, which leads to a lower heat transfer into
   the building. This acknowledged phenomenon produces better indoor
   thermal comfort conditions and reduced energy requirement for cooling,
   resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, cool roofs
   are also studied and optimized for their larger scale effect as Urban
   Heat Island mitigation strategy in dense cities. In this perspective,
   several reflective coatings and materials were used for cool roof
   applications, e.g. light color paintings, roof tiles and waterproof
   membranes. Recent research developments were also focused on the
   analysis of natural and sustainable materials having these properties.
   In particular, stone aggregates were studied for their intrinsic cooling
   potential with varying grain size and stone typology. Roof covered by
   stone aggregates can be considered as a rigid frame porous material
   whose acoustic properties can lead to similar advantages to the thermal
   ones: (i) a small scale benefit, i.e. an increased sound reduction index
   of the roof with a consequent lower sound transfer into the building;
   (ii) a larger scale benefit, i.e. a reduction of the environmental noise
   thanks to the increased sound absorption coefficient. This paper reports
   the results of the measurement campaigns of sound absorption and
   transmission loss carried out on different samples of loose gravel with
   different grain size and thickness. To this aim, several experimental
   analyses by means of impedance tube according to the transfer function
   method described in ISO 10534-2 were carried out. Several comparative
   considerations between acoustic and thermal-energy experimental results
   represent the object of this contribution, with the final purpose to
   optimize this roof typology for its twofold potential.},

Title = {Technical, economic, and environmental assessment of liquid fuel
   production on aircraft carriers},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {256},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The supply chain to deliver fuels to aircraft carriers is complex,
   dangerous, and expensive, and one option to mitigate these risks is to
   produce fuel at sea. This work quantifies the costs, climate impacts,
   and physical characteristics of three technology pathways for fuel
   production onboard aircraft carriers: alkaline electrolysis and reverse
   water gas shift (AE + RWGS); solid oxide electrolysis and RWGS (SOEC +
   RWGS); and co-electrolysis of steam and CO2. Two design scenarios are
   evaluated: a small, infrequently operating plant using excess nuclear
   power (Scenario A); and a large, frequently operating plant with
   dedicated nuclear capacity (Scenario B). Fuel production costs are
   quantified using a Monte Carlo techno-economic analysis, ranging from
   1.91 to 4.49 and 3.25-4.23 \$/L in Scenarios A and B, respectively. The
   lowest cost technology pathway is AE + RWGS. All technology pathways are
   shown to offer reductions in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of
   82-86\% relative to petroleum JP-5. In Scenario B, the plant volume and
   weight are estimated at 50-67\% and 432\% of current aircraft carrier
   designs, respectively, highlighting challenges for technical
   feasibility. Furthermore, increasing plant production capacity and
   capacity factor is shown to reduce the unit cost of fuel production, but
   that this is largely offset by the additional costs of dedicated nuclear
   capacity required at larger scales. The results indicate that fuel
   production on an aircraft carrier may be technically feasible, cost
   competitive, and environmentally beneficial relative to the petroleum
   fuels currently in use. However, research to further reduce system cost,
   weight, and volume, including experimental validation, are still
   required.},

Title = {Predicting population consequences of ocean climate change for an
   ecosystem sentinel, the seabird Cassin's auklet},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1923-1935},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Forecasting the ecological effects of climate change on marine species
   is critical for informing greenhouse gas mitigation targets and
   developing marine conservation strategies that remain effective and
   increase species' resilience under changing climate conditions. Highly
   productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience
   substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for
   ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to
   examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California
   Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the
   planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a
   demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use
   future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling
   intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the
   population growth rate of the auklet population at the important
   Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that
   the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of
   11-45\% by the end of the century, placing this population on a
   trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling
   intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet
   foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a
   mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet
   range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been
   declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this
   century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate
   this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study
   species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic
   conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other
   important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted
   for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that
   ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this
   system.},

Title = {Modelling CO2 migration in aquifers; considering 3D seismic property

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {349-365},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Geological sequestration is one proposed measure for greenhouse gas
   mitigation; and deep, saline aquifers are considered to hold large
   storage potentials for CO2. The Johansen Formation has been suggested by
   Norwegian authorities as a potential reservoir candidate due to its
   relative proximity to land and point sources for CO2. Reservoir
   evaluations must consider the given premise of zero interference with
   ongoing gas production in the Troll Field, providing geographical
   constraints. Recent data contributions; new 3D seismic data, attribute
   analyses, and revision of the depositional model form the basis of this
   modelling study. Porosity distributions were generated from quantified
   relations with acoustic impedance. The reservoir quality varies
   according to sedimentary facies, and differentiated relative
   permeability curves were assigned accordingly. Effects of directional
   anisotropy and site-typical geological heterogeneities were considered
   through scenario-modelling. The potential for dissolution and residual
   trapping of CO2 varies according to migration paths; and was estimated
   to 50-80\% of injected CO2 after 150 years. Immobilisation was more
   efficient with increased sweep through reservoir zones with high
   irreducible gas fractions, and in scenarios where plume separation
   occurred. The main determinant, however, for improving trapping
   efficiency is the well location and injection scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Sustainable adaptation for resolving climate displacement issues of
   south eastern islands in Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Pages = {790-810},
Abstract = {Purpose - Climate change is affecting people displacement in Bangladesh
   by both sudden environmental events and gradual environmental change.
   This paper aims to assess the sustainable adaptation measures for
   resolving the displacement problem induced by climate change considering
   the socioeconomic differences between the past and the present location
   of living places for island dwellers of the south-eastern coast of
   Bangladesh.
   Design/methodology/approach - Both qualitative and quantitative
   approaches were adopted for conducting the study. The main tool of the
   household survey was a questionnaire survey. In addition to the estimate
   of displacement, the authors have used hazard impact analysis, weightage
   analysis and sustainable adaptation analysis with various ranking.
   Meaningful data were analyzed through SPSS software and presented
   through statistical techniques.
   Findings - Climate change-induced different natural disasters, such as
   cyclone, tidal surge, tidal flood and coastal erosion, were frequent in
   the study areas and responsible for mass displacement. After
   displacement, people lost not only their identity but also social and
   cultural harmony and faced different economic and environmental crises.
   However, nearly 20 types of adaptation options were identified for
   protection from the displacement of coastal people.
   Practical implications - The study prescribed 11 specific criteria and 4
   principles of sustainable adaptation options for resolving the climate
   displacement problem. Moreover, seven adaptation practices showed high
   sustainability, ten showed medium sustainability and five showed low
   sustainability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and implementation
   ability.
   Originality/value - The study would help to establish sustainable
   adaptation measures through the combination of environment, economic and
   social harmony with regard to the Sustainable Development Goals.},

Abstract = {Major changes consistent with the fingerprint of global warming have
   been reported for nearly every ecosystem on earth. Recently, studies
   have moved beyond correlation-based inference to demonstrate mechanistic
   links between warming and biological responses, particularly in regions
   experiencing rapid change. However, the assessment of climate change
   impacts and development of adaptation options that humans can undertake
   are at the earliest stages, particularly for marine systems. Here, we
   use trends in ocean temperature to characterize regions that can act as
   natural laboratories or focal points for early learning. These discrete
   marine `hotspots', where ocean warming is fastest, were identified based
   on 50 years of historical sea surface temperature data. Persistence of
   these hotspots into the future was evaluated using global climate
   models. This analysis provides insights and a starting point for
   scientists aiming to identify key regions of concern with regard to
   ocean warming, and illustrates a potential approach for considering
   additional physical drivers of change such as ocean pH or oxygenation.
   We found that some hotspot regions were of particular concern due to
   other non-climate stressors. For instance, many of the marine hotspots
   occur where human dependence on marine resources is greatest, such as
   south-east Asia and western Africa, and are therefore of critical
   consideration in the context of food security. Intensive study and
   development of comprehensive inter-disciplinary networks based on the
   hotspot regions identified here will allow earliest testing of
   management and adaptation pathways, facilitating rapid global learning
   and implementation of adaptation options to cope with future change.},

Title = {Assessing current and future heat risk in Dublin city, Ireland},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Populations in high-density urban areas are exposed to higher levels of
   heat stress in comparison to rural areas. New spatially explicit
   approaches that identify highly exposed and vulnerable areas are needed
   to inform current urban planning practices to cope with heat hazards.
   This study proposes an extreme heat stress risk index for Dublin city
   across multiple decades (2020s-2050s) and for two representative
   concentration pathways (RCPs). In order to consider the interactions
   between greenhouse gas emissions and urban expansion, a climate-based
   urban land cover classification and a simple climate model have been
   combined to compute air temperature values accounting for urban heat
   island effect. This allowed the derivation of an improved hazard
   indicator in terms of extreme heat stress which, when integrated with
   information on current levels of vulnerability (i.e., socioeconomic
   factors assessed using principal component analysis (PCA), provides a
   heat hazard risk index for Dublin city at a fine spatial scale. Between
   the 2020s and 2050s, urban areas considered at highest risk are expected
   to increase by about 70\% and 96\% under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 respectively.
   For the 2050s, enhanced levels of heat risk under the RCP 8.5 scenario
   are particularly visible in the core city centre and in the northern and
   western suburbs. This study provides a valuable reference for decision
   makers for urban planning and provides an approach to help prioritise
   management decisions for the development of heat resilient and
   sustainable cities.},

Volume = {100},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coral reef restoration is gaining considerable momentum globally in
   response to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on coral
   reefs. In Australia, as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation
   Program (RRAP), a range of unconventional interventions are currently
   being investigated to help the Great Barrier Reef resist, repair and
   recover from climate change. Many of these interventions are based on
   innovative approaches, such as assisted evolution. The regulatory
   environment is likely to be critical in determining the feasibility and
   viability of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It
   influences what, where and how to restore, who should be responsible
   for, engaged in, and benefit from restoration. This study explores the
   regulatory implications of proposed restoration and adaptation
   interventions in the context of the Great Barrier Reef. This includes
   mapping the existing regulatory and governance landscape, establishing
   an approach to account for regulatory requirements of restoration and
   adaptation interventions, and examining regulatory issues associated
   with their development and deployment. The study also scopes
   administrative capacity; i.e., the capacity of regulators in terms of
   resources and skills required to assess novel risks and impacts of reef
   restoration and adaptation interventions. It provides important insights
   that may prove useful for other jurisdictions, where ecosystem
   restoration and adaptation has become an imperative under a
   fast-changing climate.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {183},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Understanding why and where decision-makers choose to use different
   climate change adaptation strategies remains an important theoretical
   and practical question for coastal adaptation. This article provides an
   exploratory statistical analysis of three adaptation measures (shoreline
   armoring, property acquisitions, and beach nourishment) and their
   deployment with respect to metrics of risk exposure, socioeconomic
   markers, and critical infrastructure in North Carolina (U.S.). This
   exploratory analysis evaluates two propositions. First, adaptation
   measures are deployed relative to specific metrics of risk. Second,
   adaptation choice disproportionately correlates with socioeconomic
   attributes. The findings support both propositions and reveal that
   shoreline armoring correlates with higher home values, household
   incomes, and population density and low racial diversity. Property
   acquisitions are found to correlate with low home values, household
   incomes, and population density and high racial diversity. Furthermore,
   adaptation measures are interconnected. Acquisitions are more likely to
   occur in areas with low levels of armoring. Beach nourishment occurs
   exclusively in areas with shoreline armoring. The results find no
   correlation of adaptation deployment with critical infrastructure. This
   article provides the foundation for future research into how adaptation
   decisions are made and trade-offs among adaptation actions considered,
   whether decisions adequately protect critical infrastructure, and how
   deployment patterns affect social equity.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {254-265},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The recent increase of devastating floods in West Africa implies an
   urgent need for effective flood risk management. A key element of such
   management is understanding how perceptions affect the implementation of
   mitigation measures. This paper uses the technique of framework analysis
   in conjunction with the conceptual framework of protection motivation
   theory to interpret flood perceptions and mitigation actions of flood
   victims and public officials in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso as conveyed
   through in-depth semi-structured interviews. The results show that,
   despite the experience of a devastating flood in 2009 and clear
   understandings of flood causes, mitigation actions in Ouagadougou after
   the 2009 flood varied widely. This occurred due to adverse perceptions
   that mitigation actions are costly and that personal ability and
   responsibility to effect change is limited. These adverse perceptions
   offset neutral or positive perceptions that mitigation measures, if
   correctly implemented, are effective, and that the risk of flooding is
   high. The paper concludes with a comparative meta-analysis of West
   Africa flood perception and mitigation literature that reveals the need
   for actionable studies on the implementation of specific measures for
   flood risk management.},

Abstract = {Rapidly developing and complex climate change impacts have profound
   implications for coastal communities, demanding adaptation actions for
   both social and ecological systems. Along the coast of British Columbia,
   Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological
   system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the
   1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of
   colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how
   these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent
   people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge.
   Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their
   umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's
   perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate
   change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies
   emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening
   Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge
   sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3)
   promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4)
   developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive
   strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government,
   including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not
   prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts,
   indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are
   strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the
   social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of
   governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting
   Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require
   transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges
   Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to
   marine resources and territorial management rights.},

Title = {Mapping climate change-caused health risk for integrated city resilience

Volume = {77},

Pages = {67-88},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changes in climatic conditions, together with urban population growth,
   are making the development of tools to help disaster planners and policy
   makers select mitigation and adaptation measures a priority. The Coastal
   Cities at Risk (CCaR) project is a multidisciplinary team project
   involving four large coastal cities: Manila (The Philippines), Bangkok
   (Thailand), Lagos (Nigeria) and Vancouver (Canada). One of the project
   objectives includes development of a system dynamics simulation model to
   assess the resilience of the participating cities to climate change
   caused by sea level rise and riverine flooding. The resilience model is
   designed to integrate physical, economic, health, social and
   organizational impacts of climate change. This paper presents the
   methodology for providing spatial and temporal information on climate
   change health impacts for use in the resilience simulator. Basic
   population data, disease burden and physical conditions are integrated
   in the development of a composite health impact map. The output of this
   mapping exercise provides a more fully integrated view of population
   health to allow for the development of more targeted adaptive and risk
   reduction strategies at a local level for the City of Metro Vancouver.
   This methodology has been applied using data for 3 years, 2001, 2006 and
   2011 in order to give a dynamic simulation of health impacts using the
   resilience simulator. The final maps indicate that the Richmond and
   Delta regions of Metro Vancouver are more vulnerable to climate change
   caused by sea level rise and flooding compared to other municipalities.
   The paper demonstrates how composite health impact maps can be used both
   as an input for resilience modeling, as well as a ``stand-alone{''}
   product for the assessment and development of mitigation and adaptive
   strategies for coastal cities.},

Abstract = {Climate change might have direct impacts on water quantity in Egypt and
   lead to indirect effects on Mediterranean saltwater intrusion to
   groundwater, which exposes agriculture to vulnerability. This study
   investigated impacts of climate change on agriculture, with particular
   regard to food security and socioeconomy, and quantified the
   effectiveness of cropping pattern adaptation measures by integrating
   three mathematical models. The BlueM model was used for hydrological
   simulations of Nasser Lake under flooding scenarios to predict the water
   supply from the High Aswan Dam. The water and salinity balance (WB-SAL)
   model was adopted to estimate the water salinity in the Nile Delta. The
   simulated results from the BlueM and WB-SAL models were integrated with
   the agricultural simulation model for Egypt (ASME) to project cropping
   patterns, food security, and socioeconomy throughout the country. The
   results showed that future climate change will directly affect the total
   crop area; crop areas for 13 crop types; the self-sufficiency of wheat,
   rice, cereal, and maize supplies; and socioeconomic indicators. The
   proposed cropping pattern adaptation measures focus on fixing the crop
   areas of rice and orchards and providing half of the population with
   lentils, maize, onion, vegetables, milk, and meat. The adaptation
   measures have the potential to promote food security without causing
   deterioration of the socioeconomic situation. However, water
   availability has much more significant effects on food security and
   socioeconomy than cropping pattern adaptation measures do. Accordingly,
   the country should rationalize water use efficiency and increase water
   supply. (C) 2021 Hohai University. Production and hosting by Elsevier

Abstract = {PurposeAs global warming intensifies, climatic conditions are changing
   dramatically, potentially affecting specific businesses and cities'
   livability. The temperature increase in cities significantly affects
   urban residents whose percentage is to reach about 70\% by 2050. This
   paper aimed at highlighting the climate change risks in cities,
   particularly focusing on the threats to people's health due to a
   continuous temperature increase. Design/methodology/approachThis study
   was conducted in three main steps. First, the literature review on the
   effects of climate change, particularly on the continuous temperature
   rise in cities, was conducted based on the publications retrieved from
   PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Research Gate. Second, the
   survey was conducted for the sample cities for one month. Third, the
   questionnaire was used to assess possible climate change threats to the
   livability of cities. FindingsThe findings showed that urban areas are
   usually warmer than the surrounding rural areas, mainly due to the urban
   heat island effect, causing more hot days in metropolitan areas compared
   to rural areas. This paper outlines some mitigation and adaptation
   measures, which can be implemented to improve the livability in cities,
   their sustainability and the well-being of their populations.
   Originality/valueThis study reports on the climate change impacts on the
   health and livability of 15 cities, in industrialized and developing
   countries. It examines the average and maximum temperature and relative
   humidity of each city and its correlation with their livability. It was
   complemented by a survey focused on 109 cities from Africa, Asia,
   Europe, Latin America, North America and Oceania.},

   participatory research campaign (also known as ``citizen science{''}) to
   assess the City of Richmond's urban heat island effect, improved
   audience literacy and recall of adaptation and resilience solutions.
   When further nested within curriculum aligned with the National Oceanic

   hyper-localization produced additional learning and behavioral outcomes

Volume = {21},

Pages = {48-61},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cumulative pressures from global climate and ocean change combined with
   multiple regional and local-scale stressors pose fundamental challenges
   to coral reef managers worldwide. Understanding how cumulative stressors
   affect coral reef vulnerability is critical for successful reef
   conservation now and in the future. In this review, we present the case
   that strategically managing for increased ecological resilience
   (capacity for stress resistance and recovery) can reduce coral reef
   vulnerability (risk of net decline) up to a point. Specifically, we
   propose an operational framework for identifying effective management
   levers to enhance resilience and support management decisions that
   reduce reef vulnerability. Building on a system understanding of
   biological and ecological processes that drive resilience of coral reefs
   in different environmental and socio-economic settings, we present an
   Adaptive Resilience-Based management (ARBM) framework and suggest a set
   of guidelines for how and where resilience can be enhanced via
   management interventions. We argue that press-type stressors (pollution,
   sedimentation, overfishing, ocean warming and acidification) are key
   threats to coral reef resilience by affecting processes underpinning
   resistance and recovery, while pulse-type (acute) stressors (e.g.
   storms, bleaching events, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks) increase
   the demand for resilience. We apply the framework to a set of example
   problems for Caribbean and Indo-Pacific reefs. A combined strategy of
   active risk reduction and resilience support is needed, informed by key
   management objectives, knowledge of reef ecosystem processes and
   consideration of environmental and social drivers. As climate change and
   ocean acidification erode the resilience and increase the vulnerability
   of coral reefs globally, successful adaptive management of coral reefs
   will become increasingly difficult. Given limited resources,
   on-the-ground solutions are likely to focus increasingly on actions that
   support resilience at finer spatial scales, and that are tightly linked
   to ecosystem goods and services.},

Title = {Towards a Prevention-Driven Adaptation Strategy, as Applied to
   Indigenous Peoples' Internal Climate Migration: Some Inputs Based on a
   Rights-Based Approach},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE, HAZARDS AND ADAPTATION OPTIONS: HANDLING THE IMPACTS OF
   A CHANGING CLIMATE},
Series = {Climate Change Management},

Pages = {979-991},
Abstract = {Climate change-induced migration as a phenomenon is frequently reported
   and ever more evident. This phenomenon is expected to exacerbate as
   climate change impacts are susceptible to amplification. Against this
   background, some scholars contend that climate change induced migration
   is the result of a successful adaptation strategy. In this chapter, this
   claim is challenged for not taking into account climate migration
   diversity, such as the case of Indigenous Peoples being forced to leave
   their traditional lands or territories and resettle internally. The
   argument put forward is that a rights-based approach calls for
   preventative adaptation measures. This chapter builds on the
   Inter-American Court of Human Rights' case law and the Mexican case to
   illustrate the argument. Insights gained from engaging in this research
   are as follows. First, a rights-based approach calls for preventive
   adaptation measures based on Indigenous Peoples' relationship with their
   lands and territories which goes beyond lands and territories' mere
   geographical dimension but encompasses spiritual, cultural and
   historical dimensions. Second, a rights-based approach provides Guiding
   Principles that apply to preventative adaptation processes and the
   climate migration scenarios identified by Prof. Walter Kalin where a
   prevention approach applies (sudden-onset disasters, slow-onset
   environmental degradation, ``sinking{''} small islands, and ``unrest
   seriously disturbing public order, violence or even armed conflict{''}).
   Those Guiding Principles stem from the positive obligations and
   horizontal effect doctrines. Concretely, they range from environmental
   protection measures to natural resources management to avoid
   socio-environmental conflicts.},

   from fleeing the scene},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {109},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is an increasingly urgent priority for
   coastal managers. At the highest levels of governance, European Union
   and Member State adaptation policies and strategies are now well
   established, but meaningful adaptation interventions illustrating
   tangible gains in resilience remain scarce. A clear framework for
   generic adaptation processes, along with barriers to their smooth
   progress, have now been identified in the literature, and equally
   generic scenario analysis tools have been put forward to strengthen
   adaptation delivery by assisting coastal managers to overcome them.
   Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) is a relatively novel option in this
   respect, having yet to achieve the kind of widespread uptake and trial
   that more orthodox futures approaches such as intuitive logic scenarios
   have. FCM is however growing rapidly in its range of uses and breadth of
   uptake, and its utility in overcoming the barriers to adaptation among
   coastal managers is therefore worthy of analysis. This case study, in
   which FCM was employed in place of intuitive logic scenario analysis
   within an adaptation strategy development process, found FCM to carry a
   number of key strengths that intuitive logic scenario analysis has been
   found to lack. Through enabling a more detailed and granular level of
   participatory development of the `engine' of the futures process than
   possible under an intuitive logic approach, the level of buy-in and
   commitment to the adaptation strategy development process achieved among
   coastal managers and stakeholders was significantly greater.},

Title = {Assessing the merits of bioenergy by estimating marginal climate-change
   impacts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {841-852},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose Climate-change impacts can be mitigated through greater use of
   bioenergy, but the extent to which specific options actually reduce
   overall impacts needs to be assessed. Most bioenergy assessments have
   used proxy measures for assessing its merits. Here, a new approach is
   presented, whereby the contribution of bioenergy use is assessed through
   quantifying marginal changes in climate-change impacts that result from
   the implementation of a bioenergy option.
   Methods Marginal climate-change impacts were calculated for one specific
   example of a bioenergy option, conversion of an unutilised mature forest
   into a production forest harvested repeatedly for bioenergy over
   successive 25-year rotations. The overall benefit of the option was
   assessed by including stand-level carbon dynamics, global carbon-cycle
   feedback, progressively changing radiative efficiency and marginal
   impact sensitivity of warming. It also includes a differentiated
   assessment of three kinds of climatic impacts: direct-warming,
   rate-of-warming and cumulative-warming impacts. Marginal impacts were
   calculated and summed over 100 years to assess the overall marginal
   impact of this bioenergy option.
   Results and discussion Bioenergy use in this specific example led to a
   large initial loss of biomass carbon followed by an ongoing and
   accumulating benefit through fossil-fuel substitution. This caused
   adverse climatic impacts over the first two rotations as the effects of
   the on-site carbon loss dominated the overall impact, but the option
   became increasingly beneficial over longer time frames as the benefit of
   fossil-fuel substitution accrued and eventually dominated. Summed over
   100 years, the bioenergy option reduced direct-temperature and
   rate-of-warming impacts whilst increasing cumulative-warming impacts.
   The average of the three kinds of impacts showed a slight mitigation
   benefit by reducing overall impacts. In the particular example,
   bioenergy use was assessed to have a more beneficial effect if the
   analysis was carried out under the assumption of higher-emission
   concentrations pathways, or if it assumed a steeper relationship between
   climate perturbations and impacts.
   Conclusions The usefulness of any climate-change mitigation option
   ultimately relates to the marginal climate-change impacts it can avert.
   It is shown here that marginal impacts can be calculated in routine
   operation and that they can provide an objective and methodologically
   consistent assessment of the mitigation potential of bioenergy use.},

Title = {Reducing sea level rise with submerged barriers and dams in Greenland},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {779-794},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sea levels have been rising at an increasing rate in the past decades,
   due to the increased ocean temperatures and glacier melt caused by
   global warming. The continued increase in sea levels will result in
   large-scale impacts in coastal areas as they are submerged by the sea.
   Locations not able to bear the costs of implementing protection and
   adaptation measures will have to be abandoned, resulting in social,
   economic, and environmental losses. The most important mitigation goal
   for sea level rise is to reduce or possibly revert carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions. However, given the magnitude and long time lag between
   emissions and impacts, new adaptation measures to reduce sea level rise
   should be proposed, developed and if possible, implemented. This paper
   suggests that submerged barriers or dams built in front of ice sheets
   and glaciers would contribute to reducing the ice melt in Greenland. The
   ten proposed barriers or dams in this paper could prevent the
   contribution to sea level rise by up to 5.3m at a cost of US\$ 0.275
   billion a year. This is much lower when compared to adaptation measures
   to sea level rise around the world estimated to be US\$ 1.4 trillion a
   year by 2100.},

Abstract = {Land use change, coupled with rapid human population growth, has
   increased ecosystem degradation, giving rise to ecosystem restoration
   initiatives worldwide. We conducted an assessment and reflection using a
   feedback framework for strategic adaptive management in three woodland
   restoration initiatives in South Africa. This is because assessment and
   reflection are critical components for successful strategic adaptive
   management. We found that the three restoration initiatives have had a
   limited emphasis on sustainable livelihood driven outcomes, because the
   initiatives mainly aimed to restore biodiversity, ecosystem
   infrastructure and ecosystem services. Consequently, we propose a
   modified livelihood framework that suggests a more inclusive approach
   towards achieving positive human outcome-driven restoration of degraded
   woodlands. Based on the framework, we emphasise that restoration
   initiatives should seek to invest in ecosystem restoration in the
   context of sustainable development goals, to enhance people's
   livelihoods, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Harmonizing
   the competing needs for resource allocation, sustainable interventions
   and livelihoods sustenance will be important, given the limited extent
   of alternative locally based livelihood options in the rural
   disadvantaged areas. This is because most of the rural population is
   largely dependent on woodland ecosystem services for their livelihoods.
   We then suggest that to ensure that human-driven outcomes are also
   equally prioritised; the assessment, reflection and feedback framework
   and the livelihoods framework should form part of restoration
   initiatives.

Abstract = {Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to
   climate change impacts including sea level rise, invasive species, ocean
   acidification, changes in rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and
   changing hazard regimes including hurricanes, floods and drought. Given
   high dependencies in Caribbean SIDS on natural resources for
   livelihoods, a focus on ecosystems and their interaction with people is
   essential for climate change adaptation. Increasingly, ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) approaches are being highlighted as an approach to
   address climate change impacts. Specifically, EbA encourages the use of
   local and external knowledge about ecosystems to identify climate change
   adaptation approaches. This paper critically reviews EbA in Caribbean
   SIDS, focusing on the need to integrate local and external knowledge. An
   analysis of current EbA in the Caribbean is undertaken alongside a
   review of methodologies used to integrate local and external expertise
   for EbA. Finally key gaps, lessons learnt and suggested ways forward for
   EbA in Caribbean SIDS and potentially further afield are identified.},

   adaptation law is currently needed to lay the foundations for the
   required long-term strategy. Such an approach would establish processes
   by which adaptation objectives are agreed for each part of the coast,
   ensure land use planning that can accommodate future change and does not
   expose new communities to risk, integrate coastal adaptation with
   biodiversity and coastal zone policy, allocate regulatory responsibility
   in a way that promotes subsidiarity and consistency, and ensure that
   funds are available for future measures.},

Title = {Nature-based Solutions in Bangladesh: Evidence of Effectiveness for
   Addressing Climate Change and Other Sustainable Development Goals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of
   natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location
   and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate
   action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but
   conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be
   expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide
   cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack
   evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we
   focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones,
   relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat
   waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have
   been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the
   outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a
   systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and
   natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development
   goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory
   management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as
   conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap
   for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if
   well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to
   natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty,
   supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found
   short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and
   conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS
   benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors:
   support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving
   all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of
   secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines.
   More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed.
   Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high
   quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable
   development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a
   Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of
   protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial
   forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in
   national planning policies.},

Abstract = {The Systems Approach Framework is a methodological framework designed to
   enhance the efficacy of human decision-making processes within
   social-ecological systems with regard to sustainability. The objective
   of resilience adaptive management is to either maintain the system
   within the current regime such that the desired ecosystem goods and
   services continue to be delivered, or to move the system phase to a
   preferred regime. Although the objectives of the two frameworks are not
   exactly the same, there are considerable complementarities between them.
   Through application of the Systems Approach Framework in a case study
   regarding the urban beaches of Barcelona, Spain, we present some of the
   main findings revealed during the model construction and stakeholder
   participatory process. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Systems
   Approach Framework could be considered a useful step-by-step
   methodological guide that employs many of the vital components and
   processes of adaptive management.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is confronting terrible impacts of climate change on
   agriculture across the country, especially in low-lying area like Haor,
   coastal region, and islands. This socioeconomic study (N = 320) examines
   the perception and knowledge of farmers on climate-induced events and
   experiences, and explores the adaptation practices they adopt to protect
   crop production and livestock farming from the impact of climate change
   in the north-eastern Haor area of the country. Using triangulation
   method, it is detected that farmers of the study area have an erroneous
   idea on climate change and the causes of frequent climate extremes.
   Study results show that respondents' perception and experiences on
   climate-induced events are verified positively with the historical trend
   and time-series analysis of climate indicators as well as with the
   findings of researchers using Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP)
   and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools and techniques. This study
   explores the traditional and systematic adaptation approaches of farmers
   which are practised at the individual or community level. The rationale
   of each of the approaches from the respondents' side is also analysed in
   the study. It is statistically tested using Chi-square that some of the
   scientific and systematic adaptation options for crop production are
   predominantly influenced by the educational qualifications of the
   respondents. The study reveals that lack of proper information prevents
   subsistence farmers to find the most effective adaptation pathways.},

Title = {A Systematic Review on the Existing Research, Practices, and Prospects
   Regarding Urban Green Infrastructure for Thermal Comfort in a
   High-Density Urban Context},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban green infrastructures (UGI) have been suggested as a natural
   solution to tackle the problem of human thermal comfort as well as to
   reduce energy consumption in buildings under the pressures of rapid
   urbanization and global warming. However, the acceptance of UGI to
   mitigate the urban heat effect is not yet universal. The development of
   such an infrastructure is also not consistent across the regions,
   emphasizing the different objective parameters and methodologies. A
   systematic review has been conducted to analyze the published research
   work on UGI, targeting thermal comfort, in the past decade to identify
   the trends of UGI development around the world. The result shows that
   most of the studied locations were situated around the Mediterranean Sea
   region in a temperate climate, and most of the studied cities are within
   countries with a high gross domestic product, large urban area and urban
   population, primary energy consumption, and high greenhouse gas and
   carbon dioxide emissions. Extensive green roofs are the most popular
   type of UGI and mostly use Sedum plants. In the published studies,
   experimental setups are the most common methods by which to collect
   data. EnergyPlus is the most popular software used to conduct energy
   analysis for buildings, whereas ENVI-met is more commonly used for
   microclimate analysis. These results indicated that the direction of UGI
   studies is driven by climate characteristics and the socioeconomic
   factors of geographical location, which favor low construction cost and
   maintenance needs, with a minimal irrigation requirement for small-scale
   UGI projects. Understanding the trend of UGI approaches for thermal
   comfort allows researchers to standardize practices that help the
   decision-making process for future researchers while recognizing the
   limitations and potential of current UGI practices. It is recommended
   that future studies should include arid and equatorial climate regions,
   with more focus on large-scale projects including high-rise building
   environments to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of UGIs.},

Abstract = {Reactive Transport Modelling and Long Term Behaviour of CO2
   Sequestration in Saline Aquifers - Geological sequestration of CO2 in
   deep saline aquifers may offer numerous opportunities for the mitigation
   of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to ensure good containment, a
   correct understanding of the evolution of such systems after a massive
   injection of CO2 is compulsory. For this purpose, coupled reactive
   transport modelling can provide useful information, by simulating
   chemical reactions likely to occur in the system coupled to reactive
   transport, at large time and space scales.
   This study aimed at investigating the Possible benefits of reactive
   transport modelling in the context Of CO2 sequestration. Two deep saline
   aquifers have been chosen to test the performance and limitations of the
   codes: the carbonated aquifer of the Dogger (Paris Basin) and the
   sandstone aquifer of the Bunter (North Sea). The aquifers, with
   contrasting behaviours, have been chosen to illustrate the main expected
   phenomena: CO2 dissolution in the carbonated aquifer carbonate mineral
   precipitation in the sandstone aquifer.
   The simulations highlight the performance of the reactive transport
   codes, particularly the possibility to represent in detail a source (or
   sink) term with the dissolution of the CO2 bubble (or the precipitation
   of carbonated minerals), coupled to the transport of the dissolved CO2.
   Furthermore, flux assessment at various points of the system illustrates
   the storage capacity, of the systems. However several shortages have
   been identified: a lack of data on the aquifers and on the reactivity of
   CO2 under sequestration conditions. Finally, developments are advisable
   to better estimate the transport, dissolution and reactivity of the
   supercritical CO2: This involves a two-phase coupled reactive transport
   code, and a coupling with the exchange between phases.},

Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries in coral reef areas support the livelihoods of
   millions of people worldwide. Anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing
   and climate change increasingly threaten both the reef ecosystem and the
   livelihood security of the people that depend on the reefs. Adaptive
   management strategies are needed to adequately deal with these threats,
   but they require an understanding of the underlying drivers, which often
   originate and act on multiple levels. Using a social-ecological system
   approach, the coral reef fishery of the Spermonde Archipelago in South
   Sulawesi/Indonesia is assessed to identify key drivers and strategic
   leverage points for management. Under the influence of international
   markets and technological changes, several export-oriented fisheries
   have developed in the area that led to distinct subsequent peaks in
   fishing activity in a pattern of sequential marine resource
   exploitation. In response to stressors such as seasonality and
   overfishing of individual locations or species, a number of coping
   strategies have developed locally. These include extensive borrowing
   from fishing patrons, diversification of fishing methods, fishing
   migrations, and the crafting of local institutions to regulate fishing
   activity. However, the coping strategies hinder, and even decrease, the
   capacity of the system to adapt to future stressors and undermine the
   sustainability of the fishery. Potential strategies that target
   different levels of the fishery system in order to strengthen adaptive
   management are identified.},

Title = {Increasing the ambition of mitigation action in small emitters: the case
   of Mauritius},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {514-528},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {The objective of the Paris Agreement is to constrain the global
   temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C and to pursue efforts to
   limit it to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. It is undisputed
   that the collective mitigation actions proposed by Parties are largely
   insufficient to meet this objective. All Parties are expected to revise
   their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) prior to the 26th
   Conference of the Parties (COP 26) with the aim of increasing levels of
   mitigation ambition. This paper focuses on Mauritius which has no
   climate mitigation policy and no strategy for low-carbon development. In
   this context, a number of policy issues are considered, and propositions
   are made on how the level of ambition of its updated NDC can be
   increased. For this, energy-related emissions pathways to 2050 are used
   to argue for an equity-based, effort-sharing approach to CO2 emissions
   reductions by capitalizing on a developing country's ability to propose
   a combination of unconditional and conditional mitigation contributions.
   Such a proactive approach will place Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS) and developing countries in a better position to justify and
   attract technology transfer, capacity building and climate finance.
   Further, the energy-climate mitigation nexus is examined to highlight
   the co-benefits of increasing mitigation ambition. It is shown that, all
   else being equal, increasing the percentage share of renewables in the
   electricity mix is necessary but not sufficient for increasing the
   ambition of mitigation contributions. The insights in this paper are
   expected to be valuable for other SIDS and small developing countries.
   Key policy insights
   A multi-criteria approach is more appropriate for assessing the level of
   ambition of SIDS and other small emitters than absolute share of global
   emissions or the percentage share of renewable energies in the energy
   mix.
   Based on this approach, the climate change mitigation policy orientation
   of Mauritius is not ambitious.
   As Mauritius updates its NDC, it should apply a systemic approach to
   investigate emission reduction scenarios across sectors and covering
   time horizons up to at least 2050, in order to better link national
   climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is increasingly becoming a priority for
   policy action. In April 2009, the European Commission released a White
   Paper outlining a proposed framework for action to reduce vulnerability
   and adapt to climate change (European Commission, 2009). The White Paper
   refers to the importance of a climate adaptation strategy and
   sustainability that integrates all areas of regional and municipal
   development including agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, public
   infrastructure (incl. building, transport, energy and water supply),
   tourism, human, animal and plant health, water resources and ecosystem
   loss (including marine ecosystems and biodiversity). One of the main
   issues is how to and why integrating the green developments into urban
   policies. In this paper we show the main objectives of London's greening
   program, and some possible elements of the green developments in
   Csomor's adaptation strategy. Comparing the two examined cities there
   are differences according to their size, population, greening
   possibilities and financial backgrounds. However, it can be seen that
   the focus points of the adaptation strategies are more close to each
   other.},

Title = {Intercellular wiring enables electron transfer between methanotrophic
   archaea and bacteria},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {526},
Number = {7574},
Pages = {587-U315},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate controls the
   emission of the greenhouse gas methane from the ocean floor(1,2). In
   marine sediments, AOM is performed by dual-species consortia of
   anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria
   (SRB) inhabiting the methane-sulfate transition zone(3-5). The
   biochemical pathways and biological adaptations enabling this globally
   relevant process are not fully understood. Here we study the syntrophic
   interaction in thermophilic AOM (TAOM) between ANME-1 archaea and their
   consortium partner SRB HotSeep-1 (ref. 6) at 60 degrees C to test the
   hypothesis of a direct interspecies exchange of electrons(7,8.) The
   activity of TAOM consortia was compared to the first ANME-free culture
   of an AOM partner bacterium that grows using hydrogen as the sole
   electron donor. The thermophilic ANME-1 do not produce sufficient
   hydrogen to sustain the observed growth of the HotSeep-1 partner.
   Enhancing the growth of the HotSeep-1 partner by hydrogen addition
   represses methane oxidation and the metabolic activity of ANME-1.
   Further supporting the hypothesis of direct electron transfer between
   the partners, we observe that under TAOM conditions, both ANME and the
   HotSeep-1 bacteria overexpress genes for extracellular cytochrome
   production and form cell-to-cell connections that resemble the nanowire
   structures responsible for interspecies electron transfer between
   syntrophic consortia of Geobacter(9,10). HotSeep-1 highly expresses
   genes for pili production only during consortial growth using methane,
   and the nanowire-like structures are absent in HotSeep-1 cells isolated
   with hydrogen. These observations suggest that direct electron transfer
   is a principal mechanism in TAOM, which may also explain the enigmatic
   functioning and specificity of other methanotrophic ANME-SRB consortia.},

Title = {Coping with climate change related conflicts - The first framework to
   identify and tackle these emerging topics},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is supposed to exacerbate conflicts arising from resource
   scarcity and contrasting objectives. Some European authors highlighted
   already the need to look at conflicting interests when elaborating and
   applying adaptation and mitigation strategies. This study analysed the
   level of consideration of these emerging topics arising through
   increased competition of resources, contrasting interests, climate
   change adaptation as well as mitigation measures for Austria and
   Southern Germany in detail. Furthermore, it surveyed the application of
   possible approaches for conflict prevention and mitigation in an
   international perspective and additionally examined the particular role
   of SEA as one of the instruments to cope with conflicts related to
   climate change. The results express the strong need to look at emerging
   conflicts in cross-sectoral and sectoral adaptation early enough and a
   strategic perspective. Based on the content analysis of the Austrian and
   German adaptation and mitigation documents, expert interviews as well as
   the international literature review, a rather low consideration of these
   emerging topics as well as approaches to cope with them became evident.
   In response to these deficiencies, the paper introduces a first
   framework to identify and tackle emerging and exacerbated conflicts
   related to climate change. This novel framework is internationally
   applicable. In the final step of the framework approaches to prevent and
   minimize conflicts are the key topic. Among these approaches, SEA could
   take a leading role in case mandatory planning instruments cover the
   topics related to potential or existing exacerbated fields of conflicts.
   Overall a mix of formal and informal instruments and a more
   cross-sectoral perspective seems necessary. To this aim, the paper
   introduces four main guiding principles to consider and minimize
   up-coming conflicting topics.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {4-17},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to increase the resilience of building
   systems, especially roofs, in relation to climate changes. The focus is
   on Mediterranean cities, where, often, there is no regulation about
   these issues. Therefore, it is necessary to define resilience indicators
   through comparative studies of adaptive roof solutions to mitigate
   overheating in summer.\& para;\& para;Design/methodology/approach -
   Through software simulations and data comparison, a specific
   methodological approach is used to analyze the resilience levels of
   different roof solutions (phase change materials, aerogel, green and
   cool roof), starting from energy efficiency as a prerequisite of
   resilience. Moreover, a case study of a historic existing building in a
   southern Italian town is examined.\& para;\& para;Findings - The
   findings show the best strategies for building systems, especially for
   roofs, to dean urban heat island effects according to the defined
   resilience indicators against overheating mitigation.\& para;\&
   para;Research limitations/implications - Other building systems, such as
   facades, also have to be investigated in relation to climate change
   mitigation.\& para;\& para;Practical implications - The implementation
   of resilient solutions that can also affect neighborhood for urban heat
   island mitigation.\& para;\& para;Social implications - Because of
   resilience indicators definition, it is easier to introduce economic
   incentives according to reference thresholds and to increase community
   involvement.\& para;\& para;Originality/value - The paper provides a new
   approach for the evaluation of technological solutions for a building
   from a resilience point of view, which has energy efficiency as
   pre-condition.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to address the knowledge gaps on adaptive capacity of
   rural farming households to slow-onset hazards such as seawater
   intrusion. It defined household-level variables that can potentially
   explain adaptive capacity by using a principal component analysis and a
   regression model. In addition, it aimed to develop a measure-based index
   (MAI) to account for adaptation processes. The developed measure-based
   adaptation index addressed a number of shortcomings in previous studies
   and captured the variation in adaptation measures that rice farmers
   implement. The results indicated that adaptation takes place at
   different levels based on the propensity to adapt, the variety and
   diversity of adoption of various measures, the feasibility of the
   various measures, and the varying conditions of seawater intrusion. The
   research established a model of adaptation for seawater intrusion
   largely influenced by the rice farmers' economic capacity, which is
   crucial in optimizing the adaptation measures employed.},

Title = {A sequential model to link contextual risk, perception and public
   support for flood adaptation policy},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {122},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The economic damage from coastal flooding has dramatically increased
   over the past several decades, owing to rapid development in shoreline
   areas and possible effects of climate change. To respond to these
   trends, it is imperative for policy makers to understand individuals'
   support for flood adaptation policy. Using original survey data for all
   coastal counties of the United States Gulf Coast merged with contextual
   data on flood risk, this study investigates coastal residents' support
   for two adaptation policy measures: incentives for relocation and
   funding for educational programs on emergency planning and evacuation.
   Specifically, this study explores the interactive relationships among
   contextual flood risks, perceived flood risks and policy support for
   flood adaptation, with the effects of social-demographic variables being
   controlled. Age, gender, race and partisanship are found to
   significantly affect individuals' policy support for both adaptation
   measures. The contextual flooding risks, indicated by distance from the
   coast, maximum wind speed and peak height of storm surge associated with
   the last hurricane landfall, and percentage of high-risk flood zone per
   county, are shown to impact one's perceptions of risk, which in turn
   influence one's support for both policy measures. The key finding risk
   perception mediates the impact of contextual risk conditions on public
   support for flood management policies highlights the need to ensure that
   the public is well informed by the latest scientific, engineering and
   economic knowledge. To achieve this, more information on current and
   future flood risks and options available for mitigation as well as risk
   communication tools are needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Climate-induced decrease in biomass flow in marine food webs may
   severely affect predators and ecosystem production},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2608-2622},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts on marine life in the world ocean are expected to
   accelerate over the 21st century, affecting the structure and
   functioning of food webs. We analyzed a key aspect of this issue,
   focusing on the impact of changes in biomass flow within marine food
   webs and the resulting effects on ecosystem biomass and production. We
   used a modeling framework based on a parsimonious quasi-physical
   representation of biomass flow through the food web, to explore the
   future of marine consumer biomass and production at the global scale
   over the 21st century. Biomass flow is determined by three
   climate-related factors: primary production entering the food web,
   trophic transfer efficiency describing losses in biomass transfers from
   one trophic level (TL) to the next, and flow kinetic measuring the speed
   of biomass transfers within the food web. Using climate projections of
   three earth system models, we calculated biomass and production at each
   TL on a 1 degrees latitude x1 degrees longitude grid of the global ocean
   under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We show that the
   alterations of the trophic functioning of marine ecosystems, mainly
   driven by faster and less efficient biomass transfers and decreasing
   primary production, would lead to a projected decline in total consumer
   biomass by 18.5\% by 2090-2099 relative to 1986-2005 under the ``no
   mitigation policy{''} scenario. The projected decrease in transfer
   efficiency is expected to amplify impacts at higher TLs, leading to a
   21.3\% decrease in abundance of predators and thus to a change in the
   overall trophic structure of marine ecosystems. Marine animal production
   is also projected to decline but to a lesser extent than biomass. Our
   study highlights that the temporal and spatial projected changes in
   biomass and production would imply direct repercussions on the future of
   world fisheries and beyond all services provided by Ocean.},

Abstract = {This research develops and applies a system dynamics (SD) model for the
   strategic evaluation of environmental adaptation options for coastal
   communities. The article defines and estimates asset-based measures for
   community vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity with respect
   to the environmental, economic, social, and cultural pillars of the
   coastal community under threat. The SD model simulates the annual
   multidimensional dynamic impacts of severe coastal storms and storm
   surges on the community pillars under alternative adaptation strategies.
   The calculation of the quantitative measures provides valuable
   information for decision makers for evaluating the alternative
   strategies. The adaptation strategies are designed model results
   illustrated for the specific context of the coastal community of
   Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. The dynamic trend of the
   measures and model sensitivity analyses for Charlottetown-facing
   increased frequency of severe storms, storm surges, and sea-level

Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the
   state of knowledge of mangrove Vulnerability and responses to predicted
   climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available
   evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise
   may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface
   elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer
   term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising
   sea-level will have the greatest impact oil mangroves experiencing net
   lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward
   migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at
   high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainly over other
   climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed
   on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to
   effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are
   needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation.
   Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve
   resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt
   to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of
   activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the
   mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors oil
   mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in
   systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include
   mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation,
   replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options. (C) 2008

Abstract = {This study evaluates the environmental impact assessment of sustainable
   pig farm via management of nutrient and co-product flows in the farm.
   Manure management and biogas production are among the most promising
   pathways towards fully utilizing organic waste within a circular
   bioeconomy as the most environmentally friendly solution mitigating
   gaseous emissions and producing bioenergy and high-quality
   bio-fertilizers. The concept of farm management includes rearing pig,
   growing all the feeds needed, and managing the nutrients and co-product
   flows in the farm. A consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) was
   performed to examine three scenarios in which all the generated manure
   is used as fertilizer for barley cultivation and mineral fertilizer is
   used where necessary (SC1); produced surplus straw is used for thermal
   energy generation and maize is used for sale, substituting maize biomass
   in the market (SC2); and all co-products are circulated in a closed
   system (SC3). The functional unit (FU) was defined as a ``farm with 1000
   fattening pigs at farm gate{''}. The analysis showed that heat
   generation from wheat, barley and legumes straw has a significantly
   higher positive environmental impact than the use of these cereal straw
   for biogas production. The partial replacement of mineral fertilizers
   with digestate has positive environmental effects in terms of abiotic
   depletion, photochemical oxidation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater
   aquatic ecotoxicity, human toxicity, and marine aquatic ecotoxic
   aspects. The amount of digestate generated on a farm is not sufficient
   to completely eliminate the use of mineral fertilizers for plant
   fertilization. The generated pig manure (SC1) and digestate (SC2) is
   only enough for the fertilization of 8.3\% of the total cultivated land
   of farm applying 22.9 t/ha rate.},

Title = {Strengthening coastal adaptation planning through scenario analysis: A
   beneficial but incomplete solution},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is an increasing priority for coastal
   management. European Union and Member State adaptation policies and
   strategies have been promulgated but associated with minimal delivery of
   adaptation interventions and tangible gains in resilience. Generic
   stages of adaptation and barriers to adaptation have been identified:
   various tools or instruments have potential to strengthen adaptation
   delivery. Scenario analysis is one tool which provides a description of
   alternate possible future states and has been used to support adaptation
   planning. This work aims to assess how readily those engaged in coastal
   management decision-making are able to develop and utilise scenarios of
   change for adaptation and whether it represents a `best practice'
   approach for adaptation planning. The scenario analysis facilitated many
   aspects of the adaptation process, which ultimately led to a tractable
   adaptation strategy being produced. However, pathways for integrated
   approaches to co-deliver adaptation were less evident. The planning
   horizon, much beyond usual governmental budget and project cycles, the
   need for trade-offs and embedded institutional constraints meant that a
   majority of those who had started out on the scenario analysis became
   disengaged by its conclusion. The analysis undertaken concurs with
   theoretical work which projects a tail-off of the benefits of scenario
   analysis at the later stages of the adaptation cycle. The work concludes
   that scenario analysis offers the potential to overcome key barriers to
   adaptation progress. However, the gains may be limited as the
   institutional drivers for longer-term pro-active planning may be weak
   compared to present day roles, responsibilities and competitive
   pressures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Prioritising resilience policies to reduce welfare losses from natural
   disasters: A case study for coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Quantified flood risk assessments focus on asset losses, neglecting
   longer-term impacts to household welfare via income and consumption
   losses. The extent of welfare losses depends upon resilience - the
   ability to anticipate, resist, cope, recover and learn from a shock.
   Here, we use a novel welfare loss modelling framework and perform a
   high-resolution spatial analysis in coastal Bangladesh to quantify
   welfare losses from a tropical cyclone under present and future climatic
   and socio-economic conditions. We further test various adaptation
   options that are intended to enhance resilience. Results show that poor
   households experience, on average, 7\% of the asset losses, but 42\% of
   the welfare losses. Combining dike heightening, post-disaster support
   and stronger housing can reduce welfare losses by up to 70\%, and foster
   sustainable development by benefitting the poor, increasing resilience
   and demonstrating robustness under socio-economic and climatic
   uncertainties. Thus, a welfare orientated perspective helps to identify
   adaptation options that enhance resilience and leave no-one behind.},

Title = {The Role of Chitosan as a Possible Agent for Enteric Methane Mitigation
   in Ruminants},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Ruminant husbandry is one the largest contributors to
   greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector, particularly of
   methane gas, which is a byproduct of the anaerobic fermentation of
   structural and non-structural carbohydrates in the rumen. Increasing the
   efficiency of production systems and decreasing its environmental burden
   is a global commitment, thus methane mitigation is a strategy in which
   to reach these goals by rechanneling metabolic hydrogen (H-2) into
   volatile fatty acids (VFA) to reduce the loss of energy as methane in
   the rumen, which ranges from 2\% (grain rations) to 12\% (poor-quality
   forage rations) of gross energy intake. A strategy to achieve that goal
   may be through the manipulation of rumen fermentation with natural
   compounds such as chitosan. In this review, we describe the effects of
   chitosan on feed intake and rumen fermentation, and present some results
   on methanogenesis. The main compounds with antimethanogenic properties
   are the secondary metabolites, which are generally classified into five
   main groups: saponins, tannins, essential oils, organosulfurized
   compounds, and flavonoids. Novel compounds of interest include chitosan
   obtained by the deacetylation of chitin, with beneficial properties such
   as biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and chelation of
   metal ions. This compound has shown its potential to modify the rumen
   microbiome, improve nitrogen (N) metabolism, and mitigate enteric
   methane (CH4) under some circumstances. Further evaluations in vivo are
   necessary at different doses in ruminant species as well as the economic
   evaluation of its incorporation in practical rations.
   Abstract: Livestock production is a main source of anthropogenic
   greenhouse gases (GHG). The main gases are CH4 with a global warming
   potential (GWP) 25 times and nitrous oxide (N2O) with a GWP 298 times,
   that of carbon dioxide (CO2) arising from enteric fermentation or from
   manure management, respectively. In fact, CH4 is the second most
   important GHG emitted globally. This current scenario has increased the
   concerns about global warming and encouraged the development of
   intensive research on different natural compounds to be used as feed
   additives in ruminant rations and modify the rumen ecosystem,
   fermentation pattern, and mitigate enteric CH4. The compounds most
   studied are the secondary metabolites of plants, which include a vast
   array of chemical substances like polyphenols and saponins that are
   present in plant tissues of different species, but the results are not
   consistent, and the extraction cost has constrained their utilization in
   practical animal feeding. Other new compounds of interest include
   polysaccharide biopolymers such as chitosan, mainly obtained as a marine
   co-product. As with other compounds, the effect of chitosan on the rumen
   microbial population depends on the source, purity, dose, process of
   extraction, and storage. In addition, it is important to identify
   compounds without adverse effects on rumen fermentation. The present
   review is aimed at providing information about chitosan for dietary
   manipulation to be considered for future studies to mitigate enteric
   methane and reduce the environmental impact of GHGs arising from
   livestock production systems. Chitosan is a promising agent with methane
   mitigating effects, but further research is required with in vivo models
   to establish effective daily doses without any detrimental effect to the
   animal and consider its addition in practical rations as well as the
   economic cost of methane mitigation.},
