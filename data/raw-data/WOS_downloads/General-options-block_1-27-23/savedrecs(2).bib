Title = {Adapting wastewater treatment plants to sea level rise: learning from
   land subsidence in Tohoku, Japan},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Abstract = {Past studies have projected that global mean sea levels could be up to
   between 0.98 and 2.92 m higher by the year 2100 than pre-industrial
   levels, which could seriously affect wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs). However, there is currently a lack of guidelines regarding how
   these types of installations can adapt to sea level rise (SLR). The
   present research analyzes how SLR might affect WWTPs that are situated
   near the coastline and how they can adapt by using experiences of land
   subsidence as a proxy. The Tohoku region in northern Japan experienced
   severe land subsidence (up to - 1.14 m in Ishinomaki city) after the
   2011 Tohoku earthquake. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with
   staff from three significant WWTPs in the area to elucidate the effects
   that land subsidence had on their operations and how they could adapt to
   an increase in land subsidence or SLR. The results suggest that for land
   subsidence of - 0.53 m (equivalent to a SLR of + 0.53 m), the surveyed
   WWTPs were considered to be able to operate normally, without
   undertaking any major adaptation actions. Critical levels that influence
   the vulnerability and adaptation strategies of WWTPs to SLR were
   identified. These critical levels can help differentiate between the
   three types of SLR-induced flooding that can affect the plants, namely
   coastal flooding, discharge flooding and groundwater inundation. WWTPs
   utilizing combined sewage systems may face more difficulties when
   adapting to SLR. Finally, the authors proposed limit-state adaptation
   pathways for WWTPs situated in low-lying coastal areas, including a
   sequence of possible countermeasures and a timeline for specific actions
   to take place.},

Title = {Implications of sea-level rise for overwash enhancement at South
   Portugal},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Volume = {109},
Number = {3},
Pages = {2221-2239},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Overwash is one of the most prominent hazards affecting coastal zones,
   and the associated consequences are expected to increase because of both
   sea-level rise and intensification of coastal occupation. This study
   used a 23-year data set of wave heights and tide-surge levels to define
   return periods of overwash potential for current and future sea-level
   conditions, namely 2055 and 2100, at two sites from South Portugal. A
   relevant intensification of both frequency and magnitude of the overwash
   is expected to occur by mid-century if adaptation measures are not taken
   and further aggravated by 2100. Current overwash levels with a return
   period of 100-years can reach a return period lower than 20-years by
   2055 and 10-years by 2100. However, these values are rather variable
   from site to site, highlighting the urgency to develop detailed local
   studies to identify climate change impacts along coastal sectors, based
   on validated equations and long-term time series. These could be easily
   carried by replicating and adapting the here proposed methodology to
   sandy coasts worldwide. Understating the impact that climate change
   (namely sea-level rise) may have at the local level is key to contribute
   to effective management plans that include adaptation measures to
   minimize risks associated with coastal floods.},

Title = {Geodesign Approaches to City Resilience Planning: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The increased frequency of extreme events facing society is placing
   mounting pressure on cities and regions that need more robust resilience
   planning against growing uncertainty. Data augmented participatory
   methods, such as geodesign, offer much promise in supporting strategic
   planning to make our cities and regions more resilient. In that context,
   this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of geodesign
   practices in resilience planning, through a systematic review of the
   selected 487 studies available from various bibliographic databases. The
   results indicate that a total of 75 studies were connected to resilience
   thinking, with a focus on climate change, floods, and sea level rise
   risks. A significant cluster of those resilience-related studies worked,
   especially, on improving sustainability. A detailed analysis of 59
   relevant geodesign case studies revealed a strong underlying emphasis on
   disaster risk reduction and management activities. This study also
   noticed two prominent approaches among the analysed case studies to
   future city scenario planning: computational (41 studies), and
   collaborative (18 studies). It is recommended that an explicit
   integration of these two approaches into the geodesign approach can
   assist future city resilience planning endeavours. Thus, future research
   should further investigate the utility of integrating data-driven
   modelling and simulation within a collaborative scenario planning
   process, the usability of digital tools such as planning support systems
   within a collaborative geodesign framework, and the value of the plan's
   performance evaluation during resilience decision-making. Another area
   for future work is increased community engagement in city resilience
   practices. The geodesign approach can provide a comprehensive framework
   for bringing communities, decision-makers, experts, and technologists
   together to help plan for more resilient city futures. Finally, while
   geodesign's explicit role in empirical resilience implementations has
   been found to be low in this systematic review study, there are
   significant opportunities to support evidence-based and collaborative
   city resilience planning and decision-making activities.},

Title = {Heat in courtyards: A validated and calibrated parametric study of heat
   mitigation strategies for urban courtyards in the Netherlands},
Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {108-124},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Outdoor thermal comfort in urban spaces is an important contributor to
   pedestrians' health. A parametric study into different geometries and
   orientations of urban courtyard blocks in the Netherlands was therefore
   conducted for the hottest day in the Dutch reference year (19th June
   2000 with the maximum 33 degrees C air temperature). The study also
   considered the most severe climate scenario for the Netherlands for the
   year 2050. Three urban heat mitigation strategies that moderate the
   microclimate of the courtyards were investigated: changing the albedo of
   the facades of the urban blocks, including water ponds and including
   urban vegetation. The results showed that a north-south canyon
   orientation provides the shortest and the east-west direction the
   longest duration of direct sun at the centre of the courtyards.
   Moreover, increasing the albedo of the facades actually increased the
   mean radiant temperature in a closed urban layout such as a courtyard.
   In contrast, using a water pool and urban vegetation cooled the
   microclimates; providing further evidence of their promise as strategies
   for cooling cities. The results are validated through a field
   measurement and calibration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {On 25 October 2011 very intense rainfall affected a wide area between
   eastern Liguria and northern Tuscany (NW Italy) causing thousands of
   landslides and floods. The Vernazza catchment (Cinque Terre) suffered
   very severe damages that affected both the road network and the
   historical village of Vernazza, where a disastrous debris flood
   occurred. After the disaster, in the framework of the land management of
   the Vernazza municipality, some local structural works aimed to secure
   the exposed buildings and roads, have been carried out by emergency
   procedure. This paper describes the different executed works, affecting
   only problematic slopes and stream segments. It is believed that
   geo-hydrological risk mitigation measures able to ensure long-term
   effects are needed at basin scale. Detailed studies aimed to hazard
   assessment and to the evaluation of vulnerable areas are required for
   the choice of proper risk mitigation strategies. Considering the high
   environmental and cultural value of Cinque Terre, characterized by a
   man-made terraced landscape, that currently is mainly abandoned, the
   issue of sustainable land management can be crucial both for risk
   mitigation and socio-economic development.},

Title = {Solutions to blue carbon emissions: Shrimp cultivation, mangrove
   deforestation and climate change in coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {68-75},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Bangladesh, export-oriented shrimp farming is one of the most
   important sectors of the national economy. However, shrimp farming in
   coastal Bangladesh has devastating effects on mangrove forests.
   Mangroves are the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics, and blue
   carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions from
   mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation are accumulating. These
   anthropogenic carbon emissions are the dominant cause of climate change,
   which in turn affect shrimp cultivation. Some adaptation strategies
   including Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA), mangrove
   restoration, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest
   Degradation (REDD +) could help to reduce blue carbon emissions.
   Translocation of shrimp culture from mangroves to open-water IMTA and
   restoration of habitats could reduce blue carbon emissions, which in
   turn would increase blue carbon sequestration. Mangrove restoration by
   the REDD + program also has the potential to conserve mangroves for
   resilience to climate change. However, institutional support is needed
   to implement the proposed adaptation strategies.},

   this study is to introduce a theoretical model about the climate change
   resilience concept to facilitate and enhance future climate change
   resilience-related researches. The model proposed in this study is named
   as the climate change resilience of place (C-CROP) model, a geo-based
   model which is designed to assess climate change resilience for any
   geographic region with an approach to the incorporation of nature-based
   solution (NBS). C-CROP model considers vulnerability, exposure,
   sensitivity to climate change on one side; another side is co-benefit,
   climate proofing, and disservices of proposed NBS. An operational
   framework of the C-CROP model is also proposed, that allows spatially
   explicit assessment of climate change resilience in real world by
   developing an indicator-based framework and comprehensive mapping using
   the geospatial approach. Therefore, this model includes vulnerability
   hotspots identification; better understanding of the pathways of
   resilience; and solutions (i.e., NBS) to infer the impacts and
   effectiveness of resilience-building interventions.},

Title = {Harmful Algal Blooms: Identifying Effective Adaptive Actions Used in
   Fishery-Dependent Communities in Response to a Protracted Event},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {The ``blob{''} of anomalously warm surface water that persisted in the
   North Pacific Ocean from 2013 to 2016 resulted in a massive harmful
   algal bloom (HAB) of Pseudo-nitzschia along the entire United States
   West Coast. The bloom produced record-breaking concentrations of domoic
   acid, a marine neurotoxin, that contaminated seafood and necessitated
   fisheries harvest closures beginning in May 2015. The subsequent
   closures were unprecedented in length and geographic extent, generating
   an economic shock for fishing communities. We sought to identify
   effective adaptive actions used in fishery-dependent communities in
   response to this event. Using survey data collected across 16 fishing
   communities following the 2015 HAB event, we empirically identified
   factors affecting an individual's: (1) absolute magnitude of income
   loss, (2) likelihood of income loss recovery, and (3) severity of
   emotional stress. Our findings indicate that individuals who suffered
   greater absolute income losses were exposed to longer fisheries
   closures, more dependent on shellfish as a source of income, and
   employed in the fishing industry. Income diversification was an
   effective strategy for reducing and/or recovering HAB related income
   losses. Advertising was also found to be an effective income recovery
   strategy, but for fishers it was associated with increased emotional
   stress. If increasing the adaptive capacity of fishery-dependent coastal
   communities to HAB events is a policy goal, then costs to adaptive
   action such as emotional stress, limited access to alternate fisheries,
   new fishing gear, a lack of alternate job skills or access to job
   networks, and a lack of advertising know-how will need to be addressed.},

Title = {``What are you going to do, Protest the Wind?{''}: Community Perceptions

   Community of St. Paul, Alaska},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-66},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The state of Alaska is experiencing increased coastal erosion due to
   climatic changes that threaten shoreline, infrastructure, and Alaska
   Native ways of life. While several Alaska Native villages have been
   impacted by severe erosion, additional communities face burgeoning
   erosion concerns. St. Paul, a remote island located in the Bering Sea,
   Alaska, and home to similar to 450 Unangan, or Aleut, residents, is
   experiencing relatively new erosion and associated flooding issues. This
   study aimed to inform St. Paul's erosion monitoring and climate
   adaptation strategies by documenting community perceptions of coastal
   erosion as an ecological and social threat within a broader context of
   multiple established climate stressors. We interviewed 21 residents to
   answer: (1) what are the community's perceptions of erosion on St. Paul
   in the context of the island's other environmental concerns?; (2) do
   current perceptions of erosion affect how local governing and management
   entities address erosion impacts?; and (3) how does erosion relate to
   and impact Unangan cultural traditions and heritage? Residents
   identified six locations of primary concern, owing to how erosion of
   those areas impact their culture, subsistence practices, and sense of
   place. We suggest methods in which local entities can better support
   proactive climate adaptation and mitigation measures and utilize
   resources for community-driven adaption planning. By documenting
   perspectives in Indigenous communities on emergent climate impacts, as
   well as perceptions of adaptation planning and implementation, it can
   establish the foundation for more collaborative, culturally relevant,
   and successful community-driven climate adaptation planning.},

Title = {Suitability pre-assessment for decoupling in-sewer captured streams to
   support urban blue-green climate adaptation measures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The application of nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation
   in cities has increased in recent years. To improve microclimatic
   conditions and to preserve the natural components of related assets,
   water supply is necessary. As an alternative to drinking water, stream
   water might serve as a natural source for irrigation. However, due to
   continuous urbanisation, water courses have often been banned
   underground in pipes or integrated in the combined sewer network, both
   making them not directly available for further usage. This article
   focuses on the perspectives of decoupling captured streams from
   underground infrastructure to support nature-based urban climate
   adaptation measures. It introduces a method to identify suitable
   locations for practical implementation considering the hydrological
   potential of the stream and the urban microclimatic sensitivity of the
   concerned area. The approach was applied in a case study in the
   north-western part of Vienna, including 16 streams with a total length
   of about 39 km covering an area of approximately 95 km(2) with about
   half a million inhabitants. This work proved the general practicality of
   the suggested method. It also revealed that about one-third of the
   investigated stream lengths appears high or medium suitable to support
   climate adaption measures, leading to notable cost savings for
   irrigation (for the substitution of drinking water) and wastewater
   treatment. Concluding, the decoupling of captured streams could
   contribute to a more sustainable and nature-based urban water
   management. The introduced method for suitability pre-assessment is
   applicable with rather easily available input data, which makes it
   transferable to other cities.},

Title = {Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local
   government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change
   adaptation},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {29-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many countries are implementing Integrated Coastal Management (ICM, also
   known as Integrated Coastal Zone Management or ICZM) as a means to
   promote the sustainable use, development and protection of coastal
   environments. It has also been shown that there is a policy and
   institutional relationship between ICM and climate change adaptation.
   This paper examines the relationship between ICM and climate change
   preparedness of local government with reference to empirical studies
   conducted in two developing nations, Mozambique and South Africa. Using
   a mixed-methods approach (content analysis of local government planning
   documents and semi structured interviews with key informants), results
   demonstrate the level of integration of coastal management, disaster
   management and climate change adaptation in local development planning;
   and assess the state of implementation of ICM and climate change
   adaptation by selected local governments in the two countries. The paper
   makes recommendations on how to improve ICM development and
   implementation for coastal adaptation. The results suggest the need for
   closer integration between coastal management, disaster management and
   climate adaptation frameworks; highlight the need for enhanced support
   for local governments from provincial and national government; and
   greater clarity with regards to the coastal management mandate of local
   government (especially in Mozambique).},

Title = {Using resilience assessments to inform the management and conservation
   of coral reef ecosystems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {277},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is causing the decline of coral reef ecosystems globally.
   Recent research highlights the importance of reducing CO2 emissions in
   combination with implementing local management actions to support reef
   health and recovery, particularly actions that protect sites which are
   more resilient to extreme events. Resilience assessments quantify the
   ecological, social, and environmental context of reefs through the lens
   of resilience, i.e., the capacity of a system to absorb or withstand
   stressors such that the system maintains its structure and functions and
   has the capacity to adapt to future disturbances and changes. Resilience
   assessments are an important tool to help marine managers and decision
   makers anticipate changes, identify areas with high survival prospects,
   and prioritize management actions to support resilience. While being
   widely implemented, however, there has not yet been an evaluation of
   whether resilience assessments have informed coral reef management.
   Here, we assess the primary and gray literature and input from coral
   reef managers to map where resilience assessments have been conducted.
   We explore if and how they have been used to inform management actions
   and provide recommendations for improving the likelihood that resilience
   assessments will result in management actions and positive conservation
   outcomes. These recommendations are applicable to other ecosystems in
   which resilience assessments are applied and will become increasingly
   important as climate impacts intensify and reduce the window of
   opportunity for protecting natural ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Regime shift often results in large, abrupt, and persistent changes in
   the provision of ecosystem services and can therefore have significant
   impacts on human wellbeing. Understanding regime shifts has profound
   implications for ecosystem recovery and management. China's coastal
   ecosystems have experienced substantial deterioration within the past
   decades, at a scale and speed the world has never seen before. Yet,
   information about this coastal ecosystem change from a dynamics
   perspective is quite limited. In this review, I synthesize existing
   information on coastal ecosystem regime shifts in China and discuss
   their interactions and cascading effects. The accumulation of regime
   shifts in China's coastal ecosystems suggests that the desired system
   resilience has been profoundly eroded, increasing the potential of
   abrupt shifts to undesirable states at a larger scale, especially given
   multiple escalating pressures. Policy and management strategies need to
   incorporate resilience approaches in order to cope with future
   challenges and avoid major losses in China's coastal ecosystem services.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal planning of urban neighborhoods in the context of global
   climate change: Lessons for urban form design in Tehran, Iran},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {51},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is a growing concern in recent years about temperature rise
   resulting from climate change, especially in high-density urban areas,
   where it is exacerbated in urban heat islands (UHI). In hot and dry
   climates, this concern makes it necessary to find a practical solution
   to adapt to climate change. Rapidly developed cities with large
   populations, due to ignoring the creation of UHI in planning, mostly
   have fallen into severe trouble. So, finding the influence of decisions'
   impacts on urban climate before implementing them would inform planners
   about the consequences of their decisions. Advanced 3D-4D numerical
   models like ENVI-met are becoming a frequent way of investigating
   climatic impacts of decisions and regulations. However, full-scale
   modeling of a neighborhood or a city cannot be widely possible at
   present. Therefore, a practical solution is simplification of
   small-scale models to calculate the consequences of decisions in
   developments. In this study, we systematically propose some solutions
   for cooling urban neighborhoods, and then, after analyzing them,
   possible scenarios for UHI mitigation are presented. The goal is to find
   the most effective urban form and design strategies across a typical
   range of Tehran urban development at a high-density urban fabric. Our
   results provide insight into the impact of urban form and design on
   microclimate in hotter and drier future cities by considering water
   shortage and utilizing mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Transboundary fisheries, climate change, and the ecosystem approach:
   taking stock of the international law and policy seascape},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The ecosystem approach to fisheries management is a conceptual and
   practical framework consistent with, and supportive of, climate change
   adaptation at the national and regional level. Implementing an ecosystem
   approach can contribute to climate change adaptation by improving
   ecosystem resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, by
   providing planning strategies and tools to monitor and assess the
   impacts of climate change on fisheries, and by relying on precautionary,
   flexible, and adaptive approaches that account for the uncertainties,
   surprises, unpredictability, and dynamism of ecosystems in a changing
   climate.
   In this article, I provide an overview of some key considerations
   framing the mandate and capacity of regional fisheries management
   organizations and arrangements to implement ecosystem approaches in the
   context of climate change. The article first addresses the extent to
   which international law of the sea, and in particular the 1995 United
   Nations Fish Stock Agreement, endorses and implements an ecosystem
   approach to fisheries for the management of straddling and highly
   migratory stocks. It then addresses the barriers to more effective
   implementation of an integrated and adaptive ecosystem approach to
   fisheries in transboundary settings, including the decentralized and
   consensus-based nature of international law, stationary visions of
   ecosystems, and principles of certainty and stability. This analysis is
   then expanded to focus on specific challenges of adapting to
   climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks distribution and
   abundance. I address preparing and planning for climate change,
   responsive decision-making procedures, regulation of new fisheries,
   jurisdictional challenges, enhancing marine resilience, and revisiting
   allocation agreements, highlighting legal provisions and policy
   developments that may support or enhance the adaptive capacity of
   transboundary fisheries arrangements. I conclude that, despite some
   supportive legal provisions and practices, structural, legal, and
   political barriers severely hinder the pace and the scope of required
   governance and management responses to climate-induced changes to
   transboundary stocks.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We use the Northeast US Urban Climate Archipelago as a case study to
   explore three key limitations of planning and policy initiatives to
   mitigate extreme urban heat. These limitations are: (1) a lack of
   understanding of spatial considerations-for example, how nearby urban
   areas interact, affecting, and being affected by, implementation of such
   policies; (2) an emphasis on air temperature reduction that neglects
   assessments of other important meteorological parameters, such as
   humidity, mixing heights, and urban wind fields; and (3) too narrow of a
   temporal focus-either time of day, season, or current vs. future
   climates. Additionally, the absence of a direct policy/planning linkage
   between heat mitigation goals and actual human health outcomes, in
   general, leads to solutions that only indirectly address the underlying
   problems. These issues are explored through several related atmospheric
   modeling case studies that reveal the complexities of designing
   effective urban heat mitigation strategies. We conclude with
   recommendations regarding how policy-makers can optimize the performance
   of their urban heat mitigation policies and programs. This optimization
   starts with a thorough understanding of the actual end-point goals of
   these policies, and concludes with the careful integration of scientific
   knowledge into the development of location-specific strategies that
   recognize and address the limitations discussed herein.},

Title = {Climate change and n-3 LC-PUFA availability},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN LIPID RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) are
   essential fatty acids for the growth, development and survival of
   virtually all organisms. There is increasing evidence that anthropogenic
   climate change has a direct and indirect impact on the availability of
   natural n-3 LC-PUFA. However, this information is fragmented and not
   well organized. Therefore, this article reviewed published data from
   laboratory experiments, field experiments and model simulations to
   reveal the impact of climate change on the global supply of natural n3
   LC-PUFA and how this will limit the availability of n-3 LC-PUFA in the
   future food web. In general, climate change can significantly reduce the
   availability of natural n-3 LC-PUFA in grazing food webs in the
   following ways: 1) decrease the total biomass of phytoplankton and shift
   the plankton community structure to a smaller size, which also reduce
   the biomass of animals in higher trophics; 2) reduce the n-3 LC-PUFA
   content and/or quality (n-3: n-6 ratio) of all marine organisms; 3)
   reduce the transfer efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA in grazing food web. In
   addition, as an anthropogenic climate adaptation measure, this review
   also proposed some alternative sources of n-3 LC-PUFA and determined the
   direction of future research. The information in this article is very
   useful for providing a critical analysis of the impact of climate change
   on the supply of natural n-3 LC-PUFA. Such information will aid to
   establish climate adaptation or management measures, and determine the
   direction of future research.},

Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Thailand plays a central economic and policy-making role in Southeast
   Asia. Although climate change adaptation is being mainstreamed in
   Thailand, a well-organized overview of the impacts of climate change and
   potential adaptation measures has been unavailable to date. Here we
   present a comprehensive review of climate-change impact studies that
   focused on the Thai water sector, based on a literature review of six
   sub-sectors: riverine hydrology, sediment erosion, coastal erosion,
   forest hydrology, agricultural hydrology, and urban hydrology. Our
   review examined the long-term availability of observational data,
   historical changes, projected changes in key variables, and the
   availability of economic assessments and their implications for
   adaptation actions. Although some basic hydrometeorological variables
   have been well monitored, specific historical changes due to climate
   change have seldom been detected. Furthermore, although numerous future
   projections have been proposed, the likely changes due to climate change
   remain unclear due to a general lack of systematic multi-model and
   multi-scenario assessments and limited spatiotemporal coverage of the
   study area. Several gaps in the research were identified, and ten
   research recommendations are presented. While the information contained
   herein contributes to state-of-the-art knowledge on the impact of
   climate change on the water sector in Thailand, it will also benefit
   other countries on the Indochina Peninsula with a similar climate.},

Title = {Storm impacts along European coastlines. Part 1: The joint effort of the

Abstract = {The current paper discusses the topic of marine storm impact along
   European coastlines, presenting results from two FP7 Projects currently
   focusing on this topic, one working on the physical aspects of the
   problem (MICORE) and the other one on the socio-economic implications
   (ConHaz).
   The MICORE Project aims to provide on-line predictions of storm-related
   physical hazards (hydrodynamic as well as morphodynamic). The ConHaz
   Project addresses the socio-economic implications should these (or
   other) hazards actually materialize. Together these projects aim to
   deliver crucial information for emergency response efforts, while
   realizing the practical limitations for information processing and
   dissemination during crisis situations.
   The MICORE Project has developed and demonstrated on-line tools for
   reliable predictions of the morphological impact of marine storm events
   in support of civil protection mitigation strategies. The project
   specifically targeted the development of early warning and information
   systems to support short term emergency response in case of an extreme
   storm event. The current paper discusses in detail the outcome of an
   activity of databasing historical storm data. No clear changes in
   storminess were observed, except for some storm proxies (e.g. surges)
   and only at some locations (e.g. northern Adriatic, southern Baltic,
   etc.).
   The ConHaz Project undertook a desktop study of the methods normally
   used for evaluating the impact of marine storms and the associated
   coastal hazards considering direct costs, costs due to disruption of
   production processes, indirect costs, intangible costs, and costs of
   adaptation and mitigation measures. Several methods for cost estimation
   were reviewed. From the review it emerged that normally end-users only
   evaluate direct costs after the storms, while the cost of adaptation and
   mitigation measures is only done strategically in the context of
   Integrated Coastal Zone Management plans. As there is no standardized
   method for cost evaluations in this field, it is suggested that clear
   guidelines should be produced on the basis of simplicity for use by
   end-users. The integration between historical databases of the physical
   parameters of storms and detailed cost evaluation information would
   support the development of a knowledge background in end-users and
   justify the development of adaptation strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {South Florida is home to about 8 million people. The region is
   characterized by low relief, flat topography, and hydrology driven by a
   delicate balance between rainfall and evapotranspiration, high
   surface-water and groundwater interaction, presence of urbanized areas
   along the coast, significant agricultural areas, and a protected natural
   area-the Everglades. The water resources of this complex region is
   managed by the South Florida Water Management District (District). The
   district operates this system for flood control, water supply, water
   quality treatment, and ecosystem restoration. The hydrology of this
   region is driven mainly by rainfall and evapotranspiration. Thus,
   knowledge of changes in future climate parameters that affect these
   hydrologic components is critical for (i) projecting water resources
   availability, (ii) identifying water management system vulnerability,
   and (iii) designing adaptation measures. In an attempt to evaluate
   future water resources availability of the region, downscaled daily
   bias-corrected and constructed analogs of precipitation, minimum
   temperature and maximum temperature projections from the World Climate
   Research Programme'sCoupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
   (CMIP5) multi-model dataset were analyzed. Data analysis included (i)
   identification of future trends in precipitation and temperature based
   on a total of 119 models and three climate forcing scenarios, (ii)
   evaluation of future seasonal water availability of the region, and
   (iii) assessing the impact of changes in precipitation, temperature and
   sea level on south Florida's water management system. The results of
   this study will be beneficial for water resources planners to design
   climate change adaptation measures that enhance the resiliency of the
   water management system.},

Title = {Ecological-economic sustainability of the Baltic cod fisheries under
   ocean warming and acidification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Pages = {110-118},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Human-induced climate change such as ocean warming and acidification,
   threatens marine ecosystems and associated fisheries. In the Western
   Baltic cod stock socio-ecological links are particularly important, with
   many relying on cod for their livelihoods. A series of recent
   experiments revealed that cod populations are negatively affected by
   climate change, but an ecological-economic assessment of the combined
   effects, and advice on optimal adaptive management are still missing.
   For Western Baltic cod, the increase in larval mortality due to ocean
   acidification has experimentally been quantified. Time-series analysis
   allows calculating the temperature effect on recruitment. Here, we
   include both processes in a stock-recruitment relationship, which is
   part of an ecological-economic optimization model. The goal was to
   quantify the effects of climate change on the triple bottom line
   (ecological, economic, social) of the Western Baltic cod fishery. Ocean
   warming has an overall negative effect on cod recruitment in the Baltic.
   Optimal management would react by lowering fishing mortality with
   increasing temperature, to create a buffer against climate change
   impacts. The negative effects cannot be fully compensated, but even at 3
   degrees C warming above the 2014 level, a reduced but viable fishery
   would be possible. However, when accounting for combined effects of
   ocean warming and acidification, even optimal fisheries management
   cannot adapt to changes beyond a warming of + 1.5 degrees above the
   current level. Our results highlight the need for multi-factorial
   climate change research, in order to provide the best available, most
   realistic, and precautionary advice for conservation of exploited
   species as well as their connected socio-economic systems.},

Title = {Climate Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Concerns in Urban Areas: A
   Systematic Review of the Impact of IPCC Assessment Reports},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban areas continue to be the center of action for many countries due
   to their contribution to economic development. Many urban areas, through
   the urbanization process, have become vulnerable to climate risk,
   thereby making risk mitigation and adaptation essential components in
   urban planning. The study assessed the impacts of IPCC Assessment
   Reports (ARs) on academic research on risk mitigation and adaptation
   concerns in urban areas. The study systematically reviewed literature
   through searches of the Web of Science and Scopus databases; 852 papers
   were retrieved and 370 were deemed eligible. The results showed that the
   East Asia and Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia regions were most
   interested in IPCC ARs, while Sub-Saharan Africa showed little interest.
   Several urban concerns, including socio-economic, air quality, extreme
   temperature, sea level rise/flooding, health, and water supply/drought,
   were identified. Additionally, studies on negative health outcomes due
   to extreme temperatures and air pollution did not appear in the first
   four IPCC ARs. However, significant studies appeared after the launch of
   the AR5. Here, we must state that climate-related problems of
   urbanization were known and discussed in scientific papers well before
   the formation of the IPCC. For instance, the works of Clarke on urban
   structure and heat mortality and Oke on climatic impacts of
   urbanization. Though the IPCC ARs show impact, their emphasis on
   combined mitigation and adaptation policies is limited. This study
   advocates more combined risk mitigation and adaptation policies in urban
   areas for increased resilience to climate risk.},

   Studies on Mesoscale},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With rapid urbanization, population growth and anthropogenic activities,
   an increasing number of major cities across the globe are facing severe
   urban heat islands (UHI). UHI can cause complex impacts on the urban
   environment and human health, and it may bring more severe effects under
   heatwave (HW) conditions. In this paper, a holistic review is conducted
   to articulate the findings of the synergies between UHI and HW and
   corresponding mitigation measures proposed by the research community. It
   is worth pointing out that most studies show that urban areas are more
   vulnerable than rural areas during HWs, but the opposite is also
   observed in some studies. Changes in urban energy budget and major
   drivers are discussed and compared to explain such discrepancies. Recent
   studies also indicate that increasing albedo, vegetation fraction and
   irrigation can lower the urban temperature during HWs. Research gaps in
   this topic necessitate more studies concerning vulnerable cities in
   developing countries. Moreover, multidisciplinary studies considering
   factors such as UHI, HW, human comfort, pollution dispersion and the
   efficacy of mitigation measures should be conducted to provide more
   accurate and explicit guidance to urban planners and policymakers.</p>},

Abstract = {The anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 that drives global warming
   and ocean acidification raises serious concerns regarding the future of
   corals, the main carbonate biomineralizers. Here we used transcriptome
   analysis to study the effect of long-term gradual temperature increase
   (annual rate), combined with lowered pH values, on a sub-tropical Red
   Sea coral, Stylophora pistillata, and on a temperate Mediterranean
   symbiotic coral Balanophyllia europaea. The gene expression profiles
   revealed a strong effect of both temperature increase and pH decrease
   implying for synergism response. The temperate coral, exposed to a twice
   as high range of seasonal temperature fluctuations than the Red Sea
   species, faced stress more effectively. The compensatory strategy for
   coping apparently involves deviating cellular resources into a massive
   up-regulation of genes in general, and specifically of genes involved in
   the generation of metabolic energy. Our results imply that sub-lethal,
   prolonged exposure to stress can stimulate evolutionary increase in
   stress resilience.},

Title = {Towards resilient flood risk management for Asian coastal cities:
   Lessons learned from Hong Kong and Singapore},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {576-589},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Many coastal cities are experiencing growing risk to hydrological
   hazards through the combination of uncontrolled urban development and
   exposure to natural phenomena linked to climate change, including rising
   sea levels, intensified storms, and amplified storm surges. This growing
   risk is particularly acute in Asian coastal mega-cities, many of which
   have yet to develop adequate adaptation policies to address plausible
   impacts of climate change. In this analysis, we review how Hong Kong and
   Singapore, two of the most affluent coastal cities in East Asia, have
   initiated many flood mitigation strategies policies that have allowed
   them to reduce the impacts flooding. These strategies, once relying
   largely on building flood control structures, have now evolved to
   include holistic flood risk management approaches that include
   socio-economic factors. Arguably these two success stories provide
   inspiration for other coastal Asian cities. However, as climate change
   and uncontrolled development are likely to increase urban flooding in
   the future, general improvements could be made to improve knowledge
   transfer: e.g., develop means to work across policy silos and strike
   compromises between conflicting sectoral responsibilities, and develop
   long-term integrated strategies using planning tools and practices to
   address growing risk. While knowledge transfer cannot be direct because
   of different geographical settings, socio-economic situations, and
   political situations, we encourage governments to look beyond
   engineering-based flood control structures as to develop flood
   governance programs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change has serious implications on our environment. Examples of
   such natural risks are massive rainfalls and the rise of ocean levels.
   Millions of people are exposed to the risk of extreme floods and storms.
   It is therefore crucial to develop analytical tools that allow us to
   evaluate the threats of floods and to investigate the influence of
   mitigation and adaptation measures, such as stronger dikes, adaptive
   spatial planning, and flood disaster plans. The objective of our work is
   to present a flood management system that aims to model and visualize
   floods. It provides realistic images to help users in understanding and
   interpreting these disaster scenarios. In order to investigate the
   applicability in practice, we illustrated the use of our system for
   real-world data in a case study for the city of Paris, France.},

Title = {Observed and model simulated twenty-first century hydro-climatic change
   of Northern Ethiopia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Study region: This study focuses on Tekeze river basin of northern
   Ethiopia, and it is characterized by a typical dry biogeophysical
   environment.
   Study focus: In recent years, recurrent droughts are having an adverse
   impact on agricultural production and water resources in northern
   Ethiopia. Climate change through changes on temperature, precipitation
   and streamflow, may further strain this critical situation. This study
   has investigated the observed (1961-2014) and potential (2006-2099)
   hydro-climatic changes in Tekeze river basin of northern Ethiopia.
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used to downscale temperature and
   precipitation predicated by 30 General Circulation Models (GCMs) as well
   as the projected streamflow changes for two Representative Concentration
   Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenario.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Results indicate that the
   variability of climatic factors as temperature and precipitation was
   observed to be both spatially and temporally diverse for the considered
   Tekeze river basin. Accordingly, the response of streamflow was also
   spatiotemporally complex. GCMs were evaluated with several performance
   indictors regarding patterns in hydroclimatic variables. The analysis
   showed the superiority of the multimodel ensemble means compared with
   individual GCM output. GCM projections for the 21century indicate a
   gradual reductions in streamflow attributed to the combined effect of
   increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. The persistent
   increase of temperature and decrease of precipitation will have negative
   impacts on water availability and agriculture, hence site specific
   adaptation strategies are necessary.},

Title = {Oyster reef restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Extent, methods
   and outcomes},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {20-28},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Shellfish reef restoration to support ecological services has become
   more common in recent decades, driven by increasing awareness of the
   functional decline of shellfish systems. Maximizing restoration benefits
   and increasing efficiency of shellfish restoration activities would
   greatly benefit from understanding and measurement of system responses
   to management activities. This project (1) compiles a database of
   northern Gulf of Mexico inshore artificial oyster reefs created for
   restoration purposes, and (2) quantitatively assesses a subset of reefs
   to determine project outcomes. We documented 259 artificial inshore
   reefs created for ecological restoration. Information on reef material,
   reef design and monitoring was located for 94, 43 and 20\% of the reefs
   identified. To quantify restoration success, we used diver surveys to
   quantitatively sample oyster density and substrate volume of 11 created
   reefs across the coast (7 with rock; 4 with shell), paired with 7
   historic reefs. Reefs were defined as fully successful if there were
   live oysters, and partially successful if there was hard substrate. Of
   these created reefs, 73\% were fully successful, while 82\% were
   partially successful. These data highlight that critical information
   related to reef design, cost, and success remain difficult to find and
   are generally inaccessible or lost, ultimately hindering efforts to
   maximize restoration success rates. Maintenance of reef creation
   information data, development of standard reef performance measures, and
   inclusion of material and reef design testing within reef creation
   projects would be highly beneficial in implementing adaptive management.
   Adaptive management protocols seek specifically to maximize short and
   long-term restoration success, but are critically dependent on tracking
   and measuring system responses to management activities. Published by

Title = {Global Lessons for Adapting Coastal Communities to Protect against Storm
   Surge Inundation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {790-801},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal inundation as a result of global sea-level rise and storm surge
   events is expected to affect many coastal regions and settlements.
   Adaptation is widely accepted as necessary for managing inundation risk.
   However, managing inundation risk is inherently contentious because of
   many uncertainties and because a large number of stakeholder interests
   and values are mobilised. For these reasons, among others, adaptation
   progress in many countries has been slow. Despite progress in adaptation
   research, a critical knowledge gap remains regarding the appropriateness
   and applicability of various adaptation options, including their
   transferability between different coastal settings. We review the
   international literature on coastal adaptation options (including
   options to defend, accommodate, or retreat) to manage inundation risk,
   focusing on developed, liberal economies of Western Europe, North
   America, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand. In doing so, we identify
   the favoured strategies adopted by these nations, probe the influence of
   physical and institutional context on the selection of these options,
   and identify what lessons might be exchanged or future directions
   inferred. The review places particular emphasis on the Australian
   experience as a comparative device to highlight some important
   distinctions. These distinctions focus on how government responsibility
   is exercised, including the degree of centralisation; the ``fit{''} of
   options to local coastal environments and social values (i.e. their
   suitability and acceptability); and the transferability of different
   adaptation options in international contexts.},

Abstract = {In the 3rd Millennium, Climate Change (CC) constitutes a huge,
   multidimensional and largely impacting challenge for society as a whole,
   rating at the top of the global policy agenda. It is strongly associated
   with vulnerability of various types of regions and their capacity to
   cope with predicted but also largely unknown or not yet fully assessed
   CC repercussions. Insular territories, in this respect, despite their
   quite small contribution to CO2 emissions, seem to be cruelly affected
   by CC impacts in the years to come. This holds especially true for
   Mediterranean insular territories, since Mediterranean as a whole
   constitutes a CC hot spot in the global scenery. Coping with the ominous
   CC impacts on the spatial capital and socio-economic structure of
   Mediterranean islands implies the deployment and implementation of
   comprehensive mitigation and proactive adaptation pathways. The latter
   is the focus of this paper, attempting to: highlight the contribution of
   contemporary planning approaches in support of proactive strategic
   planning for setting up CC adaptation plans; and critically comment on
   methodological aspects for CC adaptation and related deficits in case of
   two distinct Greek insular territories - Regions of Ionian and Northern
   Aegean islands - in order for more robust approaches to emerge to the
   benefit of addressing CC vulnerabilities in such fragile territorial
   systems.},

Title = {Quantifying coastal flood vulnerability for climate adaptation policy
   using principal component analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With increasing population growth and urban sprawl, many coastal
   lowlands are unprecedentedly vulnerable to climate change and its
   impacts, such as rising sea levels, increasing extreme storm events, and
   coastal flooding. Quantifying coastal flood vulnerability serves as a
   tool to identify a system's weakness, monitor its change, and support
   making targeted climate adaptation policies. The assessment framework
   proposed in this research uses principal component analysis (PCA) and a
   weighting method to build a composite indicator of flood vulnerability
   index and evaluate the vulnerability for 256 coastal census tracts and
   24 municipalities along the coast of Connecticut, USA. The research uses
   Keiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity to test
   sample adequacy and performs data standardization for all indicators.
   Through PCA, 30 coastal vulnerability-related indicators were grouped
   into four major dimensions: hazard exposure, socio-economic,
   physical/land use and land cover, and natural. The findings highlight
   the variations of flood vulnerability across highly ur-banized areas,
   suburban areas, and rural areas; and the gradient from coastal
   low-elevation region to high-elevation inland area. This variance is
   unevenly caused by different dimensions although they may trade-off with
   each other when aggregated, the dominant dimensions play a significant
   or decisive role in the vulnera-bility assessment. This research built
   an automatic and objective assessment framework that is flexible enough
   to be applied at a smaller scale so as to obtain detailed analysis and
   it can be used as a decision-making support system.},

Title = {Geophysical and social vulnerability to floods at municipal scale under
   climate change: The case of an inner-city suburb of Sydney},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Assessments of vulnerability to flooding can generate useful data for
   planners and policy makers. To the best of the authors knowledge, no
   flood-vulnerability study has combined geophysical modelling of floods
   with socioeconomic assessments of vulnerability at finer municipal or
   household scale. In addition, the extent to which vulnerability
   assessments actually feed into flood adaptation policies remains largely
   unknown.
   A new flood vulnerability index, and associated methodology, is
   proposed, combining high-resolution hydrological-hydraulic modelling
   with built-environment and socio-economic indicators at the smallest
   spatial scale at which socio-economic data is available. The main
   advantage of the methodology is its ability to incorporate
   place-specific data, hence yielding more refined simulations of floods
   and the capacity to make projections into climate futures at local
   scale. The index is built and applied to the inter-city suburb of
   Marrickville in Sydney and used to assess the effects of future climate
   change on vulnerability mapping in the suburb. Finally, the results of
   the assessment are presented to, and discussed with, the local
   government authority responsible for implementing flood adaptation
   policies for Marrickville.
   Locally specific modelling of floods, combined with socio-economic and
   built-environment mapping, has yielded a rich set of information on
   flood vulnerability and significant variability within a single suburb.
   Flood duration is projected to increase by more than 100\% under some
   climate change scenarios, as a result of reduced drainage caused by sea
   level rise. Feedback from municipal council has highlighted the
   potential usefulness of the knowledge generated by the assessment,
   especially for emergency services.},

Title = {Assessing the climate-related risk of marine biodiversity degradation
   for coastal and marine tourism},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Coastal and marine tourism faces multiple climate risks. The degradation
   of marine ecosystems may have pro-found implications for destinations,
   especially if marine activities are the main attraction. This study aims
   to assess the climate-related risk of marine habitat degradation to
   coastal and marine tourism. Risk analysis is undertaken through a
   blended methods approach by adapting the IPCC AR6 concept of climate
   risk, the Impact Chain framework and hierarchical multi-criteria
   analysis with stakeholders' participation. The study is based on
   representative European islands, allowing comparison of risk as a
   composite of hazard, vulnerability (sensitivity and adaptive capacity),
   and the exposure of the tourism system to the hazard. The analysis is
   undertaken across diverse tourism areas that share the challenge of
   developing tourism-based economies that are more resilient to climate
   change. Results indicate that the most relevant factor explaining the
   level of risk is adaptive capacity. The study captures islands'
   heterogeneities from the local perspective that might inspire
   collaborative policy-design. Different scenarios regarding the islands
   under study highlight specific adaptation policy areas that might be
   prioritised in each case to more effectively respond to the threat. The
   study demonstrates the validity of the blended methods approach for
   adaptation planning in coastal tourism areas.},

Title = {Summer urban heat island mitigation strategy development for
   high-anthropogenic-heat-emission blocks},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The negative impacts of urban heat island (UHI) have attracted more and
   more academic attention. Currently, few studies have considered the
   effects of anthropogenic heat emission (AHE) in different urban
   districts. To explore the spatial and temporal differences in
   microclimate in high-AHE areas, five high-anthropogenic-heatemission
   blocks in Xi'an, China were selected, and the microclimatic indices of
   air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH) were measured in 33
   urban points in the five typical urban blocks. Meanwhile, the urban
   morphological indices of 33 points were calculated in the 20 m and 50 m
   buffer areas (BAs). Results show that the green cover ratio (GCR), the
   impervious surface area ratio (ISAR), sky view factor (SVF) and
   reflectivity (REF) were important variables affecting microclimate.
   These indices explained up to 35\% and 31\% of the changes in AT and RH,
   respectively. In addition, the ISAR should be controlled within 44\% and
   the REF should be controlled above 21.5\%, in order to ensure that the
   maximum AT remained less than 37 degrees C (high-temperature orange
   warning) inside the block on a typical summer day. This study improves
   the prediction method of high summer temperatures in high-AHE blocks and
   provides hints for developing UHI mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Cultural dimension and adaptation to floods in a coastal settlement and
   a savannah community in Ghana},
Journal = {GEOJOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {81},
Number = {4},
Pages = {615-624},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although there have been a lot of studies on climate change adaptation,
   the cultural dimension has generally been left out of the debate. This
   study uses household surveys and focus group discussion to methodically
   assess cultural dimensions (using Hofstede) of communities, and how
   these dimensions influence preference for adaptation options to floods
   in a coastal settlement (James Town) and a savannah community (Dungu) in
   Ghana. The results show that first, inequalities in rank and traditional
   hierarchical governance structures in Dungu are relatively lower than in
   James Town, second, that there is considerable gender bias in favour of
   males in Dungu, third, there is high level of avoidance of unstructured
   and unpredictable situations in both communities, fourth, members in
   both communities are at present very willing to sacrifice their time and
   resources in order to achieve a better life in the future, and fifth,
   community members in Dungu perceive themselves as a single unit, and
   will do their best to come to the aid of members who need help during
   environmental disasters. The analysis further shows that cultural
   dimensions in the two communities generally influence the choice of
   adaptation options to floods. It has been recommended that specific
   local research such as this one which provides opportunities to analyse
   the cultural dimensions of adaptation within communities should be
   encouraged. This is because an understanding of the local cultural
   context has the potential to assist with the design of effective
   adaptation options in communities.},

Title = {Climate change induced socio-economic tipping points: review and
   stakeholder consultation for policy relevant research},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Tipping points have become a key concept in research on climate change,
   indicating points of abrupt transition in biophysical systems as well as
   transformative changes in adaptation and mitigation strategies. However,
   the potential existence of tipping points in socio-economic systems has
   remained underexplored, whereas they might be highly policy relevant.
   This paper describes characteristics of climate change induced
   socio-economic tipping points (SETPs) to guide future research on SETPS
   to inform climate policy. We review existing literature to create a
   tipping point typology and to derive the following SETP definition: a
   climate change induced, abrupt change of a socio-economic system, into a
   new, fundamentally different state. Through stakeholder consultation, we
   identify 22 candidate SETP examples with policy relevance for Europe.
   Three of these are described in higher detail to identify their tipping
   point characteristics (stable states, mechanisms and abrupt change): the
   collapse of winter sports tourism, farmland abandonment and sea-level
   rise-induced migration. We find that stakeholder perceptions play an
   important role in describing SETPs. The role of climate drivers is
   difficult to isolate from other drivers because of complex interplays
   with socio-economic factors. In some cases, the rate of change rather
   than the magnitude of change causes a tipping point. The clearest SETPs
   are found on small system scales. On a national to continental scale,
   SETPs are less obvious because they are difficult to separate from their
   associated economic substitution effects and policy response. Some
   proposed adaptation measures are so transformative that their
   implementations can be considered an SETP in terms of `response to
   climate change'. Future research can focus on identification and impact
   analysis of tipping points using stylized models, on the exceedance of
   stakeholder-defined critical thresholds in the RCP/SSP space and on the
   macro-economic impacts of new system states.},

Title = {Understanding tourism leaders' perceptions of risks from climate change:
   an assessment of policy-making processes in the Maldives using the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Coastal tourism destinations are highly vulnerable to climate change
   risks, including sea-level rise, inundation, and extreme weather events.
   While such risks pose major challenges to the sustainability of these
   destinations, they have been insufficiently examined in tourism
   research. This study uses the social amplification of risk framework as
   a basis for understanding how climate change risks are perceived and
   what processes lead to an amplification or attenuation of risk
   perceptions at management and governance levels. In the context of the
   extremely low-lying Maldives, 12 leading tourism stakeholders, including
   representatives of government, industry, and NGOs, were interviewed to
   gather empirical data on risk perceptions. Results indicate that, while
   climate change risks are amplified for international audiences, several
   factors lead to an attenuation of risks for domestic audiences. As a
   result, local tourism stakeholders are not immediately concerned, and
   adaptation measures are woefully inadequate to cope with future climate
   risks. Detailed reference is made to the policy inertia found, the
   conflicts inherent in playing down risk in order to attract jobs,
   profitable tourism investment and tourists, and the equally pressing
   need to stress risks in order to attract expertise and funds to enable
   adaptation policies to be designed and funded.},

Title = {Flood risk and adaptation strategies under climate change and urban
   expansion: A probabilistic analysis using global data},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {538},
Pages = {445-457},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {An accurate understanding of flood risk and its drivers is crucial for
   effective risk management. Detailed risk projections, including
   uncertainties, are however rarely available, particularly in developing
   countries. This paper presents a method that integrates recent advances
   in global-scale modeling of flood hazard and land change, which enables
   the probabilistic analysis of future trends in national-scale flood
   risk. We demonstrate its application to Indonesia. We develop 1000
   spatially-explicit projections of urban expansion from 2000 to 2030 that
   account for uncertainty associated with population and economic growth
   projections, as well as uncertainty in where urban land change may
   occur. The projections show that the urban extent increases by
   215\%-357\% (5th and 95th percentiles). Urban expansion is particularly
   rapid on Java, which accounts for 79\% of the national increase. From
   2000 to 2030, increases in exposure will elevate flood risk by, on
   average, 76\% and 120\% for river and coastal floods. While sea level
   rise will further increase the exposure-induced trend by 19\%-37\%, the
   response of river floods to climate change is highly uncertain. However,
   as urban expansion is the main driver of future risk, the implementation
   of adaptation measures is increasingly urgent, regardless of the wide
   uncertainty in climate projections. Using probabilistic urban
   projections, we show that spatial planning can be a very effective
   adaptation strategy. Our study emphasizes that global data can be used
   successfully for probabilistic risk assessment in data-scarce countries.

Title = {The response of deltas to sea-level rise: Natural mechanisms and
   management options to adapt to high-end scenarios},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {122-130},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The response of deltas to sea level rise (SLR) has mostly been studied
   from a perspective of human impacts like global warming and impoundment,
   or from a perspective of natural changes associated with glacial cycles.
   Here we synthesize the response of deltas to SLR by integrating research
   looking at past and future evolution to improve the potential to manage
   deltas to adapt to high rates of SLR. We hypothesize that
   fluvial-dominated deltas can be managed to survive high rates of SLR (>1
   cm year(-1)) that characterized the post-glacial period and will likely
   characterize coming centuries due to global warming. There are three
   known mechanisms for deltas to cope with SLR that are self-reinforcing
   as the rates increase, tending to enhance the efficiency of the deltaic
   sedimentary trap:
   (a) an increase in the frequency of delta lobe switching with
   accelerated SLR leading to the formation of new lobes in shallow areas
   (b) an increase in the frequency and magnitude of flood events in the
   delta plain as a consequence of an increased crevassing through the
   river natural levees, leading to enhanced sediment deposition
   (c) an increase in the frequency and magnitude of overwash events in the
   delta fringe enhancing the ability of sandy beaches to adapt to SLR.
   The current view by much of the management community is that coastal
   protection is the best strategy for future SLR up to 2-5 m, and beyond 5
   m that retreat would be the best (or the only) strategy. However, for
   the case of deltas a more functional adaptation strategy based on
   restoration can be envisioned provided that natural processes and
   ecosystem functions can be managed to increase system's resilience. The
   central element of this alternative strategy is the idea of ``rising
   grounds{''} (vertical aggradation), instead of ``rising dikes{''}, but a
   combination of both can also be foreseen and may be needed in many
   cases. This means that ``rising dikes{''} will be only feasible if
   ``rising grounds{''} is also implemented; if not, retreat will be the
   only long-term alternative. We propose that ``rising grounds{''} is the
   best adaptation strategy inmost deltas for high-end scenarios of SLR,
   though in some cases the option of retreating may be necessary in
   combination with structural and functional measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {The effect of a warmer climate on the salmon lice infection pressure

Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1849-1859},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change can hamper sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry
   by amplifying and adding to other environmental challenges. In Norway,
   salmon lice-induced mortality in wild salmonid populations is identified
   as a major risk factor for further expansion. Higher temperatures will
   induce increased production of salmon lice larvae, decreased
   developmental time from non-infective nauplii to infectious copepods,
   and higher infectivity of copepodids. In a warmer climate, a modelling
   exercise shows how these three factors lead to a significant increase in
   the infection pressure from farmed to wild salmonids, where the
   infectivity of copepodids is the term with the highest sensitivity to
   temperature changes. The total infection pressure gradually increases
   with increasing temperature, with an estimated twofold if the
   temperature increases from 9 degrees C to 11 degrees C. Thus, making it
   even harder to achieve a sustainable expansion of the industry with
   rising water temperature. This study demonstrates how bio-hydrodynamic
   models might be used to assess the combined effects of future warmer
   climate and infection pressure from salmon lice on wild salmonids. The
   results can be used as an early warning for the fish-farmers,
   conservation stakeholders and the management authorities, and serve as a
   tool to test mitigation strategies before implementation of new
   management plans.},

Abstract = {Continuity of marine port operations and recovery in the event of
   disaster and flooding are dependent upon planning for acute or chronic
   disruptions. Ports are developing the capacity to integrate climate
   change adaptation with strategic planning and making capital investments
   in infrastructure. Geospatial risk assessments have demonstrated utility
   for planning marine port terminal facilities. Such assessments have
   tended to be coarse and comprehensive (whole port cities) or narrow,
   site-specific and single-hazard approaches (single terminal or site
   scale). This study develops a methodology for major container port
   terminals on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States to advance a
   screening approach to sea level rise, identify exposure to terminals and
   associated surface transportation, and enable comparative assessment.
   The study leverages geospatial data, elevation, imagery, transportation
   databases, tide gauges, and sea level rise projections. The approach
   extends prior methods to quantify exposure across multiple ports and
   terminals. Hypsographs and modelled future tidal flooding are derived
   for each port. Results highlight the need for port planning to develop
   GIS, monitor sea level rise trends, engage in integrative assessments,
   and optimize mitigation and adaptation actions. Results show
   similarities across yet also differentially increasing threats of
   relative sea level rise and tidal flooding at individual terminals.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses worldwide challenges, perhaps most in coastal
   areas. Governments on different scales respond with planning and policy
   measures, many with drastic impact. In this paper we assess the role of
   cultural heritage in planning for climate change on the former island
   Goeree-Overflakkee in the Netherlands. We do so by exploring the
   theoretical discourse on thenexusof climate change and heritage
   discourses and relating these to an analysis of mitigation and
   adaptation measures on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the Dutch
   river delta. It appears that the scale and political urgency of climate
   change induces involvement of many different governments, resulting in
   an inconsistent integration of cultural heritage in these plans and
   policies. These outcomes demonstrate that in order to integrate heritage
   in climate adaptation and mitigation planning, governments cannot rely
   on established planning traditions for other spatial challenges.},

Abstract = {Whale watching has become an economically valuable tourism sector. The
   whale-watching industry is complex, involves multiple stakeholders and
   can involve multilevel governance. This paper uses the concept of
   adaptive management to underpin an investigation of industry knowledge
   and information exchange between two key stakeholder groups in whale
   watching in Australia - whale-watching operators and environmental
   resource managers. Twenty commercial operators and nine environmental
   resource managers were interviewed using both quantitative and
   open-ended questions. Findings showed key differences between
   stakeholders involved, and inconsistent perspectives across the
   industry. Resource managers found biological issues, species health and
   numbers and interpretation important; operators sought clear and
   consistent knowledge on compliance, legislation and rules. Only half of
   the operators had direct access to research and researchers. Managers
   found the industry to be relatively unprofessionally qualified,
   especially small and non-specialised operators. Whale-watching operators
   did not specify that any information (about new knowledge, regulations
   or policy) was obtained from environmental resource managers through
   information exchanges. There was inconsistent contact between
   stakeholders, limiting information exchange and the knowledge-building
   potential of the industry. Improved dialogue between these groups may
   not only address existing uncertainties, but also lead to more
   sustainable outcomes across the industry.},

Abstract = {Understanding mechanisms that promote social-ecological resilience can
   inform future adaptation strategies. Among seafood dependent
   communities, these can be illuminated by assessing change among
   fisheries portfolios. Here, in collaboration with a Coast Salish Nation
   in British Columbia, Canada, we used expert Indigenous knowledge and
   network analyses to chronicle differences in fisheries portfolios pre
   and post a social-ecological regime shift. We then evaluated key drivers
   of change using semi-structured interviews. We found that while
   portfolios decreased in diversity of seafood types harvested and
   consumed among individuals overtime, portfolios increased in their
   diversification at the community level because more similar seafoods
   within less diverse individual portfolios were more commonly harvested
   and consumed by the Nation as a whole. Thus, diversity can operate
   simultaneously in opposing directions at different scales of
   organization. Experts identified four key mechanisms driving these
   changes, including commercial activities controlled by a centralized
   governance regime, intergenerational knowledge loss, adaptive learning
   to new ecologi-cal and economic opportunities, and the trading of
   seafood with other Indigenous communities. Unexpectedly, increased
   predation by marine mammals was also flagged as a key driver of change.
   Adaptation strategies that support access to and governance of diverse
   fisheries, exchange of seafoods among communities, and knowledge
   transfer among generations would promote social-ecological resilience,
   food security, and community well-being.},

Abstract = {An environmental risk assessment model was developed to evaluate the
   environmental risk associated with the construction of tourism projects
   along the Red Sea coast of Egypt. The model estimates the risk of
   causing environmental harm to existing ecological receptors, while
   considering the cumulative effect of different stressors and impacts. It
   combines risk assessment and environmental impact assessment (EIA) into
   a unified analysis process. It assists planners, cooperating with the
   EIA team, in the analysis of different planning alternatives,
   construction methods, and mitigation measures. It also assists decision
   makers in evaluating the submitted EIAs before issuing construction
   permits. The model is based on a specially designed network diagram that
   describes the intermediate links between construction activities and
   existing ecological receptors. Based on the model results, activities
   responsible for high risk levels could be tracked backward for better
   management, where the effect of different mitigation measures could be
   investigated.},

Booktitle = {TRANSPORT AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Series = {Transport and Sustainability},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {105-136},
Abstract = {Purpose - To investigate the potential impacts of future climate change
   in the United Kingdom on its road and rail networks.
   Methodology/approach - The climate change impacts of increasing summer
   temperatures, decreasing winter temperatures, increased heavy
   precipitation, greater numbers of extreme weather events and rises in
   sea level are reviewed.
   Findings - Surface transportation is the most exposed element to the
   localised impacts of climate change. High summer temperatures will
   result in road rutting, rail buckling and decreased thermal comfort,
   whereas more intense winter precipitation will cause flooding, landslips
   and bridge scour across all modes. For all impacts, it is the extreme
   events (e.g. heat waves and storms) that are potentially the most
   devastating. As shown, there are some positive climate change impacts.
   For example, in the case of winter maintenance, all transport networks
   stand to benefit.
   Originality/value - In order for transport to react appropriately to the
   potential changes in climate, it is essential to understand how the road
   and rail networks may be affected and to build strategies for both
   adaptation and mitigation into plans for future developments for both
   modes.},

Title = {Simulating the effects of cool roof and PCM (phase change materials)
   based roof to mitigate UHI (urban heat island) in prominent US cities},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {103-117},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {UHI (Urban Heat Island) has become a serious concern within major cities
   due to the increased threat of climate change over time. As UHI
   intensifies, the energy consumed in urban areas increases through an
   increase in the cooling demand, and restricts the overall comfort and
   quality of life in urban regions. UHI mitigation approaches have been
   widely studied over the past few decades. However, the work presented
   here evaluates and compares how cool roof and PCM (Phase Change
   Materials) based roof technologies may perform as UHI mitigation
   strategies. Detailed thermal energy simulations were conducted with
   these two strategies over a range of seven climatic zones within the
   United States. For each mitigation strategy, five different roof types
   were chosen for the analysis. The results indicate that a higher albedo
   led to superior energy saving and UHI mitigation for all types of
   roofing materials. Also, asphalt roofs produced the best results of all
   the roof types. It was found that insulation did not play a significant
   role in the reduction of UHI effects. The maximum TRHG (through roof
   heat gain) flux was 54\% lower for the PCM roof than the cool roof at a
   wide range of albedo. Similarly, the maximum sensible heat flux for the
   PCM roof type 40\% lower than the cool roof technology for varying
   albedo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Existing environmental management approaches relevant to deep-sea mining},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Volume = {103},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Deep-sea mining (DSM) may become a significant stressor on the marine
   environment. The DSM industry should demonstrate transparently its
   commitment to preventing serious harm to the environment by complying
   with legal requirements, using environmental good practice, and
   minimizing environmental impacts. Here existing environmental management
   approaches relevant to DSM that can be used to improve performance are
   identified and detailed. DSM is still predominantly in the planning
   stage and will face some unique challenges but there is considerable
   environmental management experience in existing related industries.
   International good practice has been suggested for DSM by bodies such as
   the Pacific Community and the International Marine Minerals Society. The
   inherent uncertainty in DSM presents challenges, but it can be addressed
   by collection of environmental information, area-based/spatial
   management, the precautionary approach and adaptive management. Tools
   exist for regional and strategic management, which have already begun to
   be introduced by the International Seabed Authority, for example in the
   Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Project specific environmental management,
   through environmental impact assessment, baseline assessment,
   monitoring, mitigation and environmental management planning, will be
   critical to identify and reduce potential impacts. In addition,
   extractive companies' internal management may be optimised to improve
   performance by emphasising sustainability at a high level in the
   company, improving transparency and reporting and introducing
   environmental management systems. The DSM industry and its regulators
   have the potential to select and optimize recognised and documented
   effective practices and adapt them, greatly improving the environmental
   performance of this new industry.},

Title = {Resilience Gentrification: Environmental Privilege in an Age of Coastal
   Climate Disasters},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Climate change is exacerbating storms at the same time that humans are
   increasingly settling in areas most affected by such storms. In theory,
   post-disaster recovery offers opportunities to rebuild for sustainable
   development. However, in reality, responses to climate events often
   result in greater inequality through a process we term resilience
   gentrification. Three possible resolutions to the coastal resilience
   dialectic are managed retreat, denial, and structural mitigation.
   Structural mitigation has become the most popular response in the
   Anthropocene. This response raises the cost of coastal redevelopment,
   giving capital greater access and control over development decisions.
   These changes make coastal areas more expensive and more exclusive. We
   illustrate this process in the post-disaster recovery of two very
   different communities: Gowanus, Brooklyn and the Caribbean island of
   Barbuda. In both cases, attempts to build it back ``green{''}-using
   selective aspects of ``sustainable development{''} as a guide-come at
   the cost of exacerbating existing housing inequality. In this way,
   ``resilience{''} gets equated with wealth, thus reinforcing a cycle of
   climate injustice. To achieve a ``just sustainability,{''} government
   responses must consider and address the equity impacts of climate change
   resilience policies. Managed retreat and degrowth strategies for climate
   resilience offer greater potential for a just sustainability in the
   Anthropocene.},

Title = {Review: Climate change resilience disconnect in rural communities in

   pandemic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {The world has been hit by consequential pandemics in the past two
   millennia. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken center stage, paralyzing
   vulnerable communities in the global south impacted by unprecedented
   climate vagaries. The focus of this study is COVID-19 and climate
   resilience communication rhetoric. In this context, we embed this study
   in response to the resilience of rural livelihoods to the COVID-19
   crisis and climate resilience education communication rhetoric. We posit
   our review based on the following questions: Has COVID-19 worsened the
   climate resilience pathway for rural communities in coastal Kenya? Is
   the COVID-19 pandemic a proxy for climate resilience in rural
   livelihoods? How does COVID-19 communication rhetoric undermine climate
   resilience for vulnerable coastal communities in Kenya? Through a
   resilient theoretical paradigm, we enclose our view based on the
   existing literature along with climate resilience and COVID-19
   proliferation. In light of the current state of COVID-19, the focus has
   shifted to the pandemic that will cover climate resilience. From the
   review, climate resilience pathway has been impacted by corona virus
   with noted funding response variations, in addition, even with the
   corona virus pandemic, climate resilience communication should be
   on-going rather than sporadic. Increasing the discursive process about
   climate change challenges is critical among Kenyan coastal communities.
   We recommend inclusion of climate resilience communication in existing
   policy frameworks as a salient solution to notable information discourse
   bottlenecks.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {9-13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Global environmental changes, driven by the consequences of human
   activities and population growth, are altering our planet in ways that
   pose current threats to human health, with the magnitude of these
   threats projected to increase over coming decades if additional,
   proactive actions are not taken. Global changes, unprecedented in their
   geospatial and temporal scales, include climate change, marine
   pollution, ozone layer depletion, soil degradation, and urbanization.
   Climate change is the best studied. The health risks of a changing
   climate will become increasingly urgent as climate change affects the
   quantity and quality of food and water, increases air pollution, alters
   the distribution of vectors/pathogens and disease transmission dynamics,
   and reduces eco-physical buffering against extreme weather and climate
   events. Health systems urgently need to be improved to effectively
   address these emerging challenges. This paper provides an overview of
   the health consequences of climate change, and discusses how health
   risks can be minimized and avoided via mitigation and adaptation
   pathways.},

   on agricultural sector in the future are not understood in any great
   depth. There are many uncertainties as to how changes in temperature,
   rainfall and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will interact in
   relation to agricultural productivity. The consequences of climate
   change on various important aspects of agriculture such as crop
   production, livestock, availability of water, pest and diseases etc. are
   discussed and summarized. Each of this aspect of agriculture sector will
   have certain impact which may be positive or negative. The chapter also
   discusses on the possible mitigation measures and adaptations for

Title = {Climate Change and Risk Perceptions in Two French Coastal Communities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {95},
Pages = {875-879},
Abstract = {Understanding public perception of climate change risks in coastal
   communities is a prerequisite for effective climate adaptation. This
   study aimed at evaluating the potential impacts of climate change on two
   coastal communities on the northern coast of France by producing
   prospective maps of the coastline by 2065 and at assessing the local
   inhabitants' risk perception and preferred strategies for facing future
   coastal risks through a survey of 285 households. The solutions
   inhabitants considered the more appropriate to preserve their living
   environment while adapting to the potential impacts of climate change
   were analyzed. A vast majority of the inhabitants is aware of coastal
   risks in their municipality, but their feeling of exposure is
   spatially-influenced depending on the distance to the hazard source.
   Conversely, no relationship was found between preferred strategies for
   facing future coastal risks and proximity to the shoreline. In the
   municipality where only soft defense structures are present, more
   inhabitants opt for the ``hold the line{''} solution, while in the other
   municipality where a portion of the coast is protected by a seawall, a
   much larger proportion of the surveyed residents prefer the adaptation
   option.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between changes in land cover and the
   time-series trend of temperature using 40 years' worth of data
   (1980-2019) from 38 weather stations in South Korea to establish
   mitigation strategies for the rising temperature and heat island effect
   in urban areas. Changes in temperature were estimated by analyzing the
   time-series trend slope using daily mean temperature data. Stations with
   a high trend slope showed a mean temperature rise of 2 degrees C over
   the study period, and those with a low trend slope had a mean
   temperature rise of 0.5 degrees C. In land cover change, each study site
   was classified into three categories: areas with heavy urbanization,
   areas with few land-cover changes, and decreased rural and forest areas.
   A correlation analysis between the landcover change and temperature
   trend slope revealed a positive correlation between urban areas and the
   trend slope and a negative correlation between forest areas and the
   trend slope. The expansion of urban areas resulting from the development
   of forest areas was identified as the cause of the long-term increase in
   the urban temperature. These results will serve as useful data in the
   urban and environmental planning phase for mitigating urban heat island
   effects.},

Title = {Applying traditional knowledge to resilience in coastal rural villages},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) pointed out that since 1950, observations of various
   aspects of the climate system have revealed many changes in extreme
   weather events. Global climate change has increased both the intensity
   and frequency of disaster events, causing serious impacts worldwide.
   Because most people and economic activities are clustered in urban
   areas, most studies focus on how to enhance the resilience of urban
   areas, often overlooking the practicable resilience in rural areas,
   especially in radically different areas, such as coastal and alpine
   areas. There should be a fundamentally different resilience approaches
   in areas with low population densities, weak institutional capacities,
   and limited financial feasibility. The application of local and
   indigenous knowledge as an adaptation strategy for climate change to
   achieve the goal of balance between humans and nature has also received
   considerable attention. Therefore, this study applied in-depth
   interviews in the coastal rural village of Guogou in Taiwan. The results
   showed that practices utilizing local and indigenous knowledge have
   helped locals effectively mitigate the impacts of disasters and
   encouraged residents to live in areas with high flood exposure. Overall,
   the application of local and indigenous knowledge in such rural areas
   might be a possible solution to enhance local resilience.},

Abstract = {The expected effects of climate change and economic and population
   growth have motivated the Netherlands government to reformulate its
   policies on flood protection and water management. Flood protection and
   drainage are needed to make this low-lying country habitable and
   suitable for agriculture and other land uses: more than 65\% of the
   Netherlands is protected by dykes against flooding. The likely impacts
   of climate change in combination with socio-economic developments call
   for proactive and innovative plans. The new policies and standards are
   based on an innovative approach: instead of focusing only on prevention,
   the new standards take into account both the probability of flooding as
   well as the potential impacts and risks of flooding, for example the
   individual risk of being hit by a flood. Based on these new standards,
   conservation, adaptation and mitigation actions are used to create a
   multi-layer safety approach that focuses on the water management system
   as well as spatial planning. Examples are presented of changes in
   perspectives and how flood protection, water management and spatial
   planning are being combined. These examples can be a basis for further
   adaptation measures in both the Netherlands as well as in other
   low-lying countries worldwide. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Ecological consequences of sea level rise and flood protection
   strategies in shallow coastal systems: A quick-scan barcoding approach},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {210},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Shallow coastal ecosystems have high ecological value and contribute to
   flood protection. Their stability is, however, sensitive to the amount
   and rate of future sea level rise (SLR), their ability to trap sediment
   which allows them to grow with rising sea level, and human response to
   SLR. So far, studies have focused on assessing SLR impacts using
   resource-intensive tools. Here, we present an approach for a first-order
   assessment and easily accessible `barcode' visualization to rapidly
   assess potential impacts of both SLR and adaptation strategies on
   coastal ecosystems in a spatially explicit way. Our approach relates
   habitat types (ecotopes) to water level, morphology and salinity,
   allowing users to determine shifts in spatial arrangements of ecological
   zones under different SLR rates and strategies. We illustrate this
   approach for a transect in the Dutch Wadden Sea. We find that beyond a
   critical rate of SLR, major changes in ecotope distribution are
   projected to occur as this part of the Wadden Sea starts to drown due to
   insufficient sediment import. Even larger impacts arise from adaptation
   strategies. Closing the barrier islands will turn the Wadden Sea into a
   freshwater lake-system with the absence of intertidal areas, infilling
   of channels and bank erosion. A strategy that allows for inland
   migration of the shoreline, results in a deep tidal basin with large
   subtidal habitats, and a shifted intertidal zone. Our case study shows
   that the barcoding approach provides a rapid, quantitative and spatially
   explicit overview of the potential implications for coastal ecosystems
   under different SLR scenarios, adaptation strategies and time horizons.
   This can then be used to screen adaptation strategies before going into
   a more comprehensive analysis. The barcode visualization allows for easy
   dissemination of potential ecological impacts to a broad community.},

Abstract = {The UK's eight proposed new nuclear power stations are all to be sited
   on the coast. With a total cradle-to-grave life cycle of at least 160
   years, and heightened awareness of inundation risk following the failure
   of the Fukushima I nuclear plant in Japan this year Britain's nuclear
   developers have to show how they plan to cope with the possibility of
   rising sea levels, higher sea temperatures and more extreme weather
   events over the next two centuries. This paper describes the adaptation
   options for new nuclear and other major long-lived coastal developments.
   Despite uncertainty about climate scenarios for the 2200s, it explains
   how flexibility of design and safety margins can be incorporated from
   the outset and, when combined with routine environmental monitoring, how
   sites can be adaptively managed throughout their life cycles.},

Abstract = {Changes in the climatic system introduce uncertainties in the supply and
   management of water resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) predicts an increase of 2 to 4 degrees C over the next 100
   years. Temperature increases will impact the hydrologic cycle by
   directly increasing the evaporation of surface water sources.
   Consequently, changes in precipitation will indirectly impact the flux
   and storage of water in surface and subsurface reservoirs (i.e., lakes,
   soil moisture, groundwater, etc.). In addition, increases in temperature
   contribute to increases in the sea level, which may lead to sea water
   intrusions, water quality deterioration, potable water shortages, etc.
   Climate change has direct impacts on the surface water and the control
   of storage in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, which indirectly controls
   the groundwater recharge process. The main and direct impact of climate
   change on groundwater is changes in the volume and distribution of
   groundwater recharge. The impact of climate change on groundwater
   resources requires reliable forecasting of changes in the major climatic
   variables and accurate estimations of groundwater recharge. A number of
   Global Climate Models (GCMs) are available for understanding climate and
   projecting climate change. These GCMs can be downscaled to a basin
   scale, and when they are coupled with relevant hydrological models, the
   output of these coupled models can be used to quantify the groundwater
   recharge, which will facilitate the adoption of appropriate adaptation
   strategies under the impact of climate change.},

Abstract = {Replacing recently extinct endemic giant tortoises with extant,
   functional analogues provide the perhaps best examples of island
   rewilding to date. Yet, an efficient future application of this
   conservation action is challenging in an era of climate change. We here
   present and discuss a conceptual framework that can serve as a roadmap
   for the study and application of tortoise rewilding in an uncertain
   future. We focus on three main ecological functions mediated by giant
   tortoises, namely herbivory, seed dispersal and nutrient cycling, and
   discuss how climate change is likely to impact these. We then propose
   and discuss mitigation strategies such as artificial constructed shade
   sites and water holes that can help drive and maintain the ecosystem
   functions provided by the tortoises on a landscape scale. The
   application of the framework and the mitigation strategies are
   illustrated with examples from both wild and rewilded populations of the
   Aldabra giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, in the Western Indian
   Ocean.

Abstract = {Climate change and sea level rise (SLR) pose risks to coastal
   communities around the world, but societal understanding of the
   distributional and equity implications of SLR impacts and adaptation
   actions remains limited. Here, we apply a new analytic tool to identify
   geographic areas in the contiguous United States that may be more likely
   to experience disproportionate impacts of SLR, and to determine if and
   where socially vulnerable populations would bear disproportionate costs
   of adaptation. We use the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) to identify
   socially vulnerable coastal communities, and combine this with output
   from a SLR coastal property model that evaluates threats of inundation
   and the economic efficiency of adaptation approaches to respond to those
   threats. Results show that under the mid-SLR scenario (66.9 cm by 2100),
   approximately 1,630,000 people are potentially affected by SLR. Of
   these, 332,000 (similar to 20\%) are among the most socially vulnerable.
   The analysis also finds that areas of higher social vulnerability are
   much more likely to be abandoned than protected in response to SLR. This
   finding is particularly true in the Gulf region of the United States,
   where over 99\% of the most socially vulnerable people live in areas
   unlikely to be protected from inundation, in stark contrast to the least
   socially vulnerable group, where only 8\% live in areas unlikely to be
   protected. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the
   equity and environmental justice implications of SLR in climate change
   policy analysis and coastal adaptation planning.},

Title = {CO2 storage potential of offshore oil and gas fields in Brazil},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {112},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {CO2 storage is an important climate change mitigation strategy and a
   relevant part of the storage activity results from selecting the most
   suitable geological regions. Brazil's size and international economic
   participation justify the global interest in its emission mitigation
   actions. The use of depleted oil and gas fields presents several
   advantages such as availability of technical data, economic aspects,
   partially available infrastructure, and lower environmental impacts.
   Therefore, this article presents an estimate of 85 Brazilian offshore
   oil and gas fields' storage capacity, linking available infrastructure
   and CO2 emissions location criteria. These fields have the potential to
   store at least 1040 MtCO(2) and can go up to 3121 MtCO(2). The biggest
   Brazilian metropolises are on the coast with high levels of CO2
   emissions, and therefore allocating offshore fields to dispose of these
   gases favours shorter transport distances. The use of the storage
   capacity analysis associated with information on emissions and
   infrastructure availability are criteria that can assist in selecting
   the most suitable regions for CO2 storage in the Brazilian offshore
   area.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the adaptive capacity of static and dynamic
   hedging operating policies to shore up the performance, i.e. reliability
   and vulnerability, in irrigation water supply of Pong reservoir in
   India, during climate change. The policies were developed using genetic
   algorithm optimisation and used to force reservoir simulations for
   different climate change perturbed inflow series, whence derive the
   performance. For static hedging, the hedging fraction remains constant
   throughout the year while for dynamic hedging, this fraction varies
   monthly or seasonally. Results showed that static hedging was effective
   at tempering the systems vulnerability from its high of >= 60\% to lower
   than 25\%, while maintaining an acceptable volume-based reliability.
   Further simulations with dynamic hedging provided only modest
   improvements in these two indices. The significance of this study is its
   demonstration of the effectiveness of hedging as a climate change
   adaptation measure by limiting water shortage impacts. It also
   demonstrates that simple static hedging can match more complex dynamic
   hedging policies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Marine social-ecological conditions in the Arctic are rapidly changing.
   With many transboundary issues, such as shifting ranges of fisheries,
   biodiversity loss, sea ice retreat, economic development and pollution,
   greater pan-Arctic assessment and co-management are necessary. We
   adapted the Ocean Health Index (OHI) to compile pan-Arctic data and
   evaluate ocean health for nine regions above the Arctic Circle to assess
   the extent to which pan-Arctic assessment is possible and identify broad
   social-ecological trends. While the quality and availability of data
   varied, we assessed and scored nine OHI goals, including the pressures
   and resilience measures acting upon them. Our results show the Arctic is
   sustainably delivering a range of benefits to people, but with room for
   improvement in all goals, particularly tourism, fisheries, and protected
   places. Successful management of biological resources and short-term
   positive impacts on biodiversity in response to climate change underlie
   these high goal scores. The OHI assesses the past and near-term future
   but does not account for medium- and long-term future risks associated
   with climate change, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring,
   dynamic management, and strong action to mitigate its anticipated
   effects. A general increase in and standardisation of monitoring is
   urgently needed in the Arctic. Unified assessments, such as this one,
   can support national comparisons, data quality assessments, and
   discussions on the targeting of limited monitoring capabilities at the
   most pressing and urgent transboundary management challenges, which is a
   priority for achieving successful Arctic stewardship.},

Title = {Management strategies for coral reefs and people under global
   environmental change: 25 years of scientific research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {209},
Pages = {462-474},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems and the people who depend on them are increasingly
   exposed to the adverse effects of global environmental change (GEC),
   including increases in sea-surface temperature and ocean acidification.
   Managers and decision-makers need a better understanding of the options
   available for action in the face of these changes. We refine a typology
   of actions developed by Gattuso et al. (2015) that could serve in
   prioritizing strategies to deal with the impacts of GEC on reefs and
   people. Using the typology we refined, we investigate the scientific
   effort devoted to four types of management strategies: mitigate,
   protect, repair, adapt that we tie to the components of the chain of
   impact they affect: ecological vulnerability or social vulnerability. A
   systematic literature review is used to investigate quantitatively how
   scientific effort over the past 25 years is responding to the challenge
   posed by GEC on coral reefs and to identify gaps in research. A growing
   literature has focused on these impacts and on management strategies to
   sustain coral reef social-ecological systems. We identify 767 peer
   reviewed articles published between 1990 and 2016 that address coral
   reef management in the context of GEC. The rate of publication of such
   studies has increased over the years, following the general trend in
   climate research. The literature focuses on protect strategies the most,
   followed by mitigate and adapt strategies, and finally repair
   strategies. Developed countries, particularly Australia and the United
   States, are over-represented as authors and locations of case studies
   across all types of management strategies. Authors affiliated in
   developed countries play a major role in investigating case studies
   across the globe. The majority of articles focus on only one of the four
   categories of actions. A gap analysis reveals three directions for
   future research: (1) more research is. needed in South-East Asia and
   other developing countries where the impacts of GEC on coral reefs will
   be the greatest, (2) more scholarly effort should be devoted to
   understanding how adapt and repair strategies can deal with the impacts
   of GEC, and (3) the simultaneous assessment of multiple strategies is
   needed to understand trade-offs and synergies between actions. (C) 2018

Title = {How do climate change and associated hazards impact on the resilience of
   riparian rural communities in Bangladesh? Policy implications for
   livelihood development},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {7-18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite the increasing recognition of the need for building resilience
   among poor farmers in developing countries in the face of changing
   climate conditions, there is a lack of information on the various
   factors influencing their resilience capacity. This paper develops an
   indicator-based Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) aimed at a better
   understanding of the factors influencing resilience capacity of the most
   hazard-prone riparian rural households in Bangladesh, as a case study in
   a developing country. The RCI is a relative measure and the value ranges
   between 0 and 1, where the higher the value the higher the resilience
   capacity. The index value of 0.297 for riverine mainland households is
   significantly higher than that for char (island) households (0.201).
   However, the lower index values in both locations infers the households'
   inability to cope with and adapt to the impacts of climate change and
   associated hazards due to a lack of adaptation options along with their
   poor socio-economic conditions. The main drivers of the resilience
   capacity include livelihood strategies, level of education, and access
   to food, water and health services. Creating employment opportunities,
   increasing the level of education, and ensuring access to food, water
   and health services are potential climate-resilient strategies that are
   likely to enhance the resilience capacity of most vulnerable riparian
   households across Bangladesh, with some experiences which may be
   replicable elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Increasing awareness of the urban heat island (UHI) effect has raised
   attention about the outdoor thermal comfort in cities worldwide. Several
   studies in the last decades have revealed how critical the UHI effect
   can be in a cold climate, such as in Canadian cities. As a result, in
   Toronto, one of the cities experiencing the highest rate of building
   development in developed countries, UHI mitigation strategies are
   currently the object of extensive debates. This study evaluates
   different UHI mitigation strategies in different urban neighbors of
   Toronto, selected according to their building density. The effects of
   cool surfaces (on the roofs, on the street pavements or as vegetation
   areas) are evaluated through numerical simulations using the software
   ENVI-met. Having obtained the surface temperature, outdoor air
   temperature, mean radiant temperature, and physiologically equivalent
   temperature, this study compares the possible mitigation of net surface
   radiation and thermal radiative power. The results demonstrate that the
   duration of direct sun and the mean radiant temperature, which are
   strongly influenced by the urban form, play a significant role in urban
   thermal comfort. Finally, this research supports new policies for
   promoting sustainable urban development in Toronto, and suggests design
   strategies for a more resilient urban planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {A number of published studies have demonstrated that the human
   habitability of the primary urban areas in the Middle East, especially a
   number of areas in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, will be affected
   by extreme heat waves and elevated wet-bulb temperatures by the end of
   the 21st century. This could lead to chaos and extensive socioeconomic
   loss caused by climate change-related disasters in the rapidly expanding
   urban areas of the Middle East. The main scope of this study is to
   review the key impacts of climate change in urban areas of the Middle
   East, the vulnerability of critical urban infrastructure and systems,
   and to develop climate change adaptation strategies to create more
   robust urban environments that are resilient to both gradual climate
   change-driven events and extreme events. By efficiently preparing for
   the imminent threats posed by climate change, social and economic
   stability can be preserved, enabling growth in a changing environment.
   Due to the vulnerability of Doha to both extremes of dry-bulb and
   wet-bulb temperatures, its status is highlighted in terms of a projected
   future climate.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change will be a necessity for coastal zones in
   decades and even centuries to come. Although adaptation to climate and
   environmental changes has been a feature of human societies since the
   evolution of modern humans, current challenges posed by climate change
   and sea level rise in a crowded and developed world are of a vaster
   nature of those faced by humanity before and will necessitate new
   approaches, new techniques and new strategies. A conceptual framework is
   being developed, centered on the notions of vulnerability, adaptation
   and resilience. Adaptation to climate change will necessitate
   international cooperation and coherent strategies, although solutions
   will need to be developed with respect to local circumstances. The main
   strategies-protection, accommodation, retreat and precaution, are
   declined in various tools of technical, scientific, legislative,
   administrative, social or physical nature.},

Title = {Operationalizing ecosystem-based adaptation: harnessing ecosystem
   services to buffer communities against climate change},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Ecosystem-based approaches for climate change adaptation are promoted at
   international, national, and local levels by both scholars and
   practitioners. However, local planning practices that support these
   approaches are scattered, and measures are neither systematically
   implemented nor comprehensively reviewed. Against this background, this
   paper advances the operationalization of ecosystem-based adaptation by
   improving our knowledge of how ecosystem-based approaches can be
   considered in local planning (operational governance level). We review
   current research on ecosystem services in urban areas and examine four
   Swedish coastal municipalities to identify the key characteristics of
   both implemented and planned measures that support ecosystem-based
   adaptation. The results show that many of the measures that have been
   implemented focus on biodiversity rather than climate change adaptation,
   which is an important factor in only around half of all measures.
   Furthermore, existing measures are limited in their focus regarding the
   ecological structures and the ecosystem services they support, and the
   hazards and risk factors they address. We conclude that a more
   comprehensive approach to sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation
   planning and its systematic mainstreaming is required. Our framework for
   the analysis of ecosystem-based adaptation measures proved to be useful
   in identifying how ecosystem-related matters are addressed in current
   practice and strategic planning, and in providing knowledge on how
   ecosystem-based adaptation can further be considered in urban planning
   practice. Such a systematic analysis framework can reveal the ecological
   structures, related ecosystem services, and risk-reducing approaches
   that are missing and why. This informs the discussion about why specific
   measures are not considered and provides pathways for alternate
   measures/ designs, related operations, and policy processes at different
   scales that can foster sustainable adaptation and transformation in
   municipal governance and planning.},

Title = {The paradox of social resilience: How cognitive strategies and coping
   mechanisms attenuate and accentuate resilience},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {194-203},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper examines two concepts, social vulnerability and social
   resilience, often used to describe people and their relationship to a
   disaster. Social vulnerability is the exposure to harm resulting from
   demographic and socioeconomic factors that heighten the exposure to
   disaster. Social resilience is the ability to avoid disaster, cope with
   change and recover from disaster. Vulnerability to a space and social
   resilience through society is explored through a focus on the elderly, a
   group sometimes regarded as having low resilience while being
   particularly vulnerable. Our findings explore the degree to which an
   elderly group exposed to coastal flood risk exhibits social resilience
   through both cognitive strategies, such as risk perception and
   self-perception, as well as through coping mechanisms, such as accepting
   change and self-organisation. These attenuate and accentuate the
   resilience of individuals through their own preparations as well as
   their communities' preparations and also contribute to the delusion of
   resilience which leads individuals to act as if they are more resilient
   than they are in reality, which we call negative resilience. Thus, we
   draw attention to three main areas: the degree to which social
   vulnerability can disguise its social resilience; the role played by
   cognitive strategies and coping mechanisms on an individual's social
   resilience; and the high risk aspects of social resilience. (C) 2014

Title = {The benefits of coastal adaptation through conservation of foreshore
   vegetation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Due to rising sea levels and projected socio-economic change, global
   coastal flood risk is expected to increase in the future. To reduce this
   increase in risk, one option is to reduce the probability or magnitude
   of the hazard through the implementation of structural, Nature-based or
   hybrid adaptation measures. Nature-based Solutions in coastal areas have
   the potential to reduce impacts of climate change and can provide a more
   sustainable and cost-effective alternative to structural measures. In
   this paper, we present the first global scale assessment of the benefits
   of conserving foreshore vegetation as a means of adaptation to future
   projections of change in coastal flood risk. In doing so, we extend the
   current knowledge on the economic feasibility of implementing global
   scale Nature-based Solutions. We show that globally foreshore vegetation
   can contribute to a large decrease in both absolute and relative flood
   risk (13\% of present-day and 8.5\% of future conditions in 2080 of
   global flood risk). Although this study gives a first proxy of the flood
   risk reduction benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation at the global
   scale, it shows promising results for including Nature-based and hybrid
   adaptation measures in coastal adaptation schemes.},

Title = {Land-use planning adaptation in response to SLR based on a vulnerability
   analysis},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Low-lying coastal areas are threatened worldwide by global climate
   change effects, including sea-level rise (SLR) and frequent storm
   surges. Identifying vulnerable areas and proposing feasible adaptation
   strategies for future land-use development are particularly important.
   Using Bay County, Florida, as a case study, this study develops a
   technical methodology to develop future land-use adaptation strategies
   in response to SLR and storm surges. We propose a cellular automata (CA)
   land-use adaptation model that not only minimizes the impacts of SLR and
   flooding from storm surge events but also captures inherent spatial
   growth characteristics by integrating a vulnerability assessment with a
   land suitability analysis. To assess vulnerability, a series of
   physical, environmental, and socioeconomic indicators for exposure,
   sensitivity and adaptation have been developed. In the CA land-use
   adaptation model, transition rules are generated from an integer
   programming problem that aims to maximize land-use suitability and to
   minimize the vulnerability of newly developed land cells. The model is
   calibrated with actual land-use data from 2000 to 2010. The model
   validation indicates that the predicted land uses effectively capture
   direction of spatial growth, with a kappa coefficient of 87.9\%. In
   comparison with the results of a standard land-use development model, in
   this CA adaptation model successfully projects future developments in
   low vulnerability areas. This model could effectively help in the
   development of future land-use adaptation strategies to address the
   impacts of flooding due to SLR and storm surges.},

Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Uncertainties about climate change consequences, changing societal
   requirements and system complexity require flood protection asset
   managers to continuously evaluate their asset management policies and
   practice to manage risk and improve the resilience of their assets.
   However, there are many challenges in doing this, with asset operators
   often facing conflicting interests and major uncertainties about the
   future needs for asset performance. In the EU Interreg IV FAIR project,
   flood protection asset owners and operators, with scientific partners
   from the North Sea Region of Europe collaborated to develop practical
   guidance for adaptive asset management of flood protection
   infrastructure. The central component of this guidance is the FAIR
   framework, presented here. The framework combines insights and
   principles from ISO 55000 on asset management and ISO 14090 on climate
   adaptation with asset operator experiences to provide a practical guide
   for integration of asset management considerations within both strategic
   and operational contexts via a tactical handshake. This is a means to
   avoid the common lack of connection between strategic plans and
   operational practice. The applicability of the framework is illustrated
   with examples from Pilot Cases within the FAIR project, in which its
   value in terms of improved asset management and reduced costs has been
   demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) presents risks to communities and ecosystems
   because of hazards like coastal erosion. In order to adapt, planners and
   the public seek estimates of shoreline change with high confidence and
   accuracy. The complexity of shorelines produces considerable uncertainty
   in the timing, location and magnitude of change. We present and discuss
   a probabilistic shoreline model for SLR planning. Using the coast of
   Maui as an illustrative case, we compare this model to a common
   deterministic model. We discuss the advantages of a probability-based
   model for SLR adaptation, including for prioritizing actions, phasing,
   visualizing risk and uncertainty, and improving adaptive management.},

Title = {Looking back and looking forward: Exploring livelihood change and
   resilience building in a Brazilian coastal community},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {29-37},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Brazil, as in many other tropical countries, coastal communities have
   been dealing with a complex dynamics of change, mostly related to the
   degradation of ecosystems, growing tourism and changing government
   policies, with consequences for natural resources conservation and
   management. Understanding how these communities are dealing with such
   change and the trade-offs provide insights for building resilience. In
   this paper, we investigate how a Caicara community (traditional group of
   mixed heritage) has been dealing with social-ecological changes over the
   last 50 years, and how these changes have affected the livelihood
   resilience. Livelihood pathway analysis revealed how the system behaved
   historically and how the past dynamics influenced and may continue to
   influence resilience building. In face of challenges and disturbances,
   the coping and adaptive strategies used by this community have helped to
   maintain the diversity of livelihood options and ecosystem services,
   which contributed to resilience. Self-organization, collective action
   and political agency were important components to deal with crises
   mainly related to territorial disputes concerning overlap with protected
   areas. The trade-offs in social-ecological system dynamics were related
   to the geographical isolation of the community (located on an island),
   the creation of protected areas, and the use of tourism income as a
   livelihood strategy. Over the years, social cohesion has weakened due to
   increased economic rationality and conflicts which may undermine
   social-ecological system resilience in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Harmful algal blooms and coastal communities: Socioeconomic impacts and
   actions taken to cope with the 2015 US West Coast domoic acid event},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {96},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The 2015 U.S. West Coast domoic acid event was caused by a massive
   harmful algal bloom (HAB) that consisted mostly of the diatom
   Pseudo-nitzschia australis. It was unprecedented in its toxicity and
   geographic extent and resulted in extended and widespread closures of
   the lucrative commercial Dungeness crab and popular recreational razor
   clam fisheries. The fishery closures led to federal fisheries disaster
   declarations and generated an economic shock for coastal communities
   that depend on access to these marine resources. This study reports on
   the socioeconomic impacts of the 2015 HAB across 16 fishing communities
   on the U.S. West Coast using primary survey data. The survey instrument,
   deployed in the summer of 2017, collected information on
   socio-demographic and economic factors hypothesized to confer resilience
   or vulnerability to HABs, data quantifying individual impacts, and the
   coping and adaptive actions taken by individuals to deal with the event.
   The vast majority of survey participants (84\%) were negatively impacted
   by the 2015 HAB, but individuals employed in fishing-related occupations
   experienced greater financial, emotional, and sociocultural impacts than
   those employed in other sectors. Further, those employed in
   fishing-related occupations were less likely to recover financial losses
   suffered as a result of the event. This study identifies the pathways
   through which HABs affect fishery-dependent and fishery-associated
   sectors of U.S. West Coast communities. The understanding gained can
   help inform efforts to prepare for future HABs, mitigate their
   socioeconomic impacts, and aid recovery.},

Abstract = {Multi-risk environments pose challenges for rural and coastal
   communities in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly with regard to
   disaster risk management and climate change adaptation strategies. While
   much research has been published on disaster response and recovery for
   specific climate-related hazards in the region, such as cyclones, floods
   and droughts, there is a growing need for insight into how communities
   respond, recover and adapt to the multiple, intersecting risks posed by
   environmental, societal and economic change. This chapter frames the
   body of new research presented in this book from the perspective of
   multi-risk environments, paying particular attention to concepts central
   to the disaster response and recovery cycle, and rejecting the notion of
   a distinct boundary between climate and society. Further, this
   introductory chapter foregrounds the importance of cultural values,
   power relations, Indigenous knowledge systems, local networks and
   community-based adaptive capacities when considering resilience,
   recovery and adaptation to climate-induced disasters at the community
   and household level. Overviews of the research presented in this book
   demonstrate a diverse range of responses and adaptive strategies at the
   local level in case studies from Solomon Islands, Fiji, Cambodia and
   Samoa, as well as implications for policy, planning and management.},

Title = {Climate change denial: vulnerability and costs for Florida's coastal
   destinations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM INSIGHTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-149},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the
   vulnerability of Florida's coastal destinations to climate change and
   the costs of the adaptation measures required to cope with the impacts
   of climate change in a range of current and future scenarios.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper illustrates a range of current
   and projected climate change scenarios in Florida, the challenges the
   state is already experiencing in dealing with the impacts of climate
   change and some of the measures adopted to date in three particularly
   vulnerable coastal destinations, namely Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach and
   Sarasota.
   Findings - Although tourism is the number one industry in Florida, the
   state holds a particularly vulnerable position with respect to climate
   change. The vacuum of political will to address these issues at the
   state level is thus of particular concern given the vulnerable position
   of Florida's coastal areas. With nearly 10 percent of its land area
   lying at less than one meter above the present sea level, adaptation is
   especially urgent in Florida. The local government of Florida's cities
   such as Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach and Sarasota are not willing to
   surrender to sea level rise (SLR). However, without a strong political
   will to address climate change at the state and federal levels, the
   costs of adapting to an escalating SLR are becoming progressively
   unsustainable.
   Originality/value - This illustrative case study paper provides a
   contemporary synthesis of the implications for Florida's coastal tourism
   destinations of rising sea levels and those adaptation strategies deemed
   appropriate in the search for their longer-term sustainability.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2015},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mangroves provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including nutrient
   cycling, soil formation, wood production, fish spawning grounds,
   ecotourism and carbon (C) storage(1). High rates of tree and plant
   growth, coupled with anaerobic, water-logged soils that slow
   decomposition, result in large long-term C storage. Given their global
   significance as large sinks of C, preventing mangrove loss would be an
   effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy. It has been
   reported that C stocks in the Indo-Pacific region contain on average
   1,023MgC ha(-1) (ref. 2). Here, we estimate that Indonesian mangrove C
   stocks are 1,083 +/- 378MgC ha(-1). Scaled up to the country-level
   mangrove extent of 2.9 Mha (ref. 3), Indonesia's mangroves contained on
   average 3.14 PgC. In three decades Indonesia has lost 40\% of its
   mangroves(4), mainly as a result of aquaculture development(5). This has
   resulted in annual emissions of 0.07-0.21 Pg CO(2)e. Annual mangrove
   deforestation in Indonesia is only 6\% of its total forest loss(6);
   however, if this were halted, total emissions would be reduced by an
   amount equal to 10-31\% of estimated annual emissions from land-use
   sectors at present. Conservation of carbon-rich mangroves in the
   Indonesian archipelago should be a high-priority component of strategies
   to mitigate climate change.},

Abstract = {Differences in impacts of climate hazards across exposed units are
   determined by many factors including the severity of the hazard itself,
   the population that is exposed to the hazard and the coping capacity of
   the exposed units to the hazard. Coping capacity or adaptive capacity
   results from a combination of development status (generic capacity) and
   interventions pertinent to the hazard (specific capacity). This paper
   explores the extent to which the generic adaptive capacity may explain
   the variation in tropical cyclone impacts. Therefore this paper offers
   an empirical approach by which adaptive capacity may be measured and
   validated against actual outcomes. Results not only validate the role of
   generic adaptive capacity in explaining variations in impact but also
   reveal that general development indicators are not very important as far
   as predicting outcomes is concerned. Those indicators of development
   that can be linked to the impact process are significant in explaining
   and predicting impact. This can help identify those aspects of generic
   adaptive capacity which are important from the perspective of policy
   action for enhancing adaptive capacity to a particular climate hazard.},

Volume = {40},
Pages = {154-159},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Benefits humans rely on from the ocean - marine ecosystem services - are
   increasingly vulnerable under future climate. This paper reviews how
   three valued services have, and will continue to, shift under climate
   change: (1) capture fisheries, (2) food from aquaculture, and (3)
   protection from coastal hazards such as storms and sea-level rise.
   Climate adaptation planning is just beginning for fisheries, aquaculture
   production, and risk mitigation for coastal erosion and inundation. A
   few examples are highlighted, showing the promise of considering
   multiple ecosystem services in developing approaches to adapt to
   sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and rising sea temperatures.
   Ecosystem-based adaptation in fisheries and along coastlines and changes
   in aquaculture practices can improve resilience of species and habitats
   to future environmental challenges. Opportunities to use market
   incentives - such as compensation for services or nutrient trading
   schemes - are relatively untested in marine systems. Relocation of
   communities in response to rising sea levels illustrates the urgent need
   to manage human activities and investments in ecosystems to provide a
   sustainable flow of benefits in the face of future climate change. (C)

Abstract = {Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) is Australia's main water safety and
   rescue authority whose assets and operations include 310 local surf
   lifesaving clubs and about 150,000 trained volunteers. Rising sea level
   and increased extreme events frequency pose serious threats to SLSA's
   assets and facilities. Therefore, this research aims to explore
   adaptation pathways and strengthen the capacity of SLSA to tackle these
   threats.
   However, adaptation to climate change is very complex and encompasses a
   range of constraints such as reliable data, information, time and
   uncertainty which make quantification quite difficult. To overcome these
   challenges, the research team has utilised an array of techniques into a
   cohesive approach including participatory workshops, MIC-MAC and System
   Dynamics (SD). Through stakeholder engagement (workshops) and structural
   analysis (MIC-MAC), key variables were identified and an influence
   dependence chart (causal relationship) was created. Then, using an SD
   approach, first a conceptual model was built to understand potential
   values of SLSAs services given sea level rise (SLR) controls, adaption
   options, and feedbacks within and between the climate change and SLSA
   operations. The SD model consists of three interactive sub-models: a)
   Climate change; b) SLSA Operation; and c) Community.
   The climate change sub-model, under a range of SLR scenarios, simulates
   changes in storm events frequencies which are vital to SLSA's operation
   and assets. Therefore, adaptation investment on all forms of
   accessibility would reduce the impact of extreme storm events on a
   club's operation. A community sub-model is used to understand the
   impacts of changing climate, specifically resulting extreme events, on
   community located around clubs.},

Title = {Deconstructing vulnerability and adaptation in a coastal river basin
   ecosystem: a participatory analysis of flood risk in Nadi, Fiji Islands},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {256-269},
Abstract = {Despite the growing discussion on vulnerability and adaptation in urban
   areas, there is limited research on how smaller towns and cities in
   Small Island Developing States are being affected by and responding to
   climate change impacts. This study uses fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM),
   field visits and semi-structured interviews with 40 stakeholders across
   6 different stakeholder groups in the Nadi River Basin, Fiji Islands to
   identify, analyse and deconstruct climate change vulnerability and
   adaptation options to manage increasing flood risks. The research
   evidence suggests that vulnerability to floods in the basin is on the
   rise due to a complex mesh of three intersecting factors. Firstly,
   non-climatic pressures such as development, drainage, social change,
   agriculture, tourism growth and deforestation combine, juxtapose and
   interact in a rather unique way with global climate variability
   (interdependent systems) to increase the stress on the river and coastal
   ecosystems. Secondly, the most vulnerable or at-risk populations like
   the farmers, squatter households and in particular women within the
   community have weak coping capacity due to a combination of demographic
   and social characteristics. Thirdly, vulnerability is on the rise due to
   climate factors as well as the flurry of unplanned development,
   redevelopment and degradation of catchment resources. The research
   findings have implications for adaptation policies. In particular, the
   basin stakeholders should integrate climate change within sectorial
   planning processes, actively engage the vulnerable groups, promote
   knowledge, awareness and social learning, and invest in adaptive
   management across all levels of decision-making. Structural policy
   changes to land-use planning and insurance financing schemes are also
   necessary to address growing risks. These have the potential to enhance
   local capacities of communities to adapt to climate-induced floods and
   improve ecosystem integrity for resilience building.},

Abstract = {Observed of climate change on several decades has been linked to changes
   in the large-scale hydrological cycle and give the impacts to all areas
   include small island. Higher water temperatures and changes in extremes,
   including floods and droughts, are projected to affect water quality and
   quantity. This study was conducted to explain the condition of
   precipitation at Ternate Island related to climate change, to assess the
   saltwater intrusion in coastal area as impact of decline of groundwater
   and suggest several options as strategic adaptation plan could be done
   by government. Precipitation data had been collected from Badan
   Meteorologi, Klimatologi dan Geofisika (Meteorological Climatological
   and Geophysical Agency) and analysis of groundwater conditions were done
   by taking the geo-electric method and the measurement of physco-chemical
   parameters of groundwater. The result shows that precipitation pattern
   at study area during the last 10 yr have fluctuated and the peak of the
   dry season occurs in 2014 to 2015. The groundwater analysis found that
   below 20 m at study area, the freshwater had not found and intrusion of
   saltwater had been occuring. It was supported by result of groundwater
   quality where the condition at low tide and high tide shows that
   salinity and conductivity values obtained above the normal concentration
   for freshwater. The conditions show the region around Akegaale has been

Abstract = {The vulnerability of tourism-dependent communities, coastal tourism
   facilities, and beaches to climate change demands the use of measures
   that can urgently minimise vulnerability and in the long term achieve
   sustainable development. This paper makes policy recommendations to
   address climate change and sea level rise challenges in small island
   developing states. Using Barbados as a case study, the paper found that
   innovations in policies and projects have offset the past ills of mass
   tourism and fortuitously now serve as pre-emptive measures in adapting
   to climate change. The array of methods for combating these changes
   includes physical planning policies, integrated coastal zone management,
   and infrastructure projects. Among the key areas for policy innovation
   are the adoption of protection, accommodation, and retreat strategies,
   which are informed by rigorous cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder
   consultation. Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is also
   necessary, especially for islands where coral reef protection is urgent.
   Moreover, policy adjustments are required on building construction,
   water resources management, sewage treatment, coastal zone management,
   physical planning, and land management. Institutional constraints,
   including the lack of capacity to implement, monitor, and enforce
   measures, must also be addressed if progress is to be made in adapting
   to climate change. A major conclusion is that the severity of coastal
   damage, the importance of tourism to sustainable development, and the
   country's adaptive capacity play a key part in the selection and
   implementation of climate change adaptation measures.},

Title = {Perceptions of Australian marine protected area managers regarding the
   role, importance, and achievability of adaptation for managing the risks
   of climate change},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The rapid development of adaptation as a mainstream strategy for
   managing the risks of climate change has led to the emergence of a broad
   range of adaptation policies and management strategies globally.
   However, the success of such policies or management interventions
   depends on the effective integration of new scientific research into the
   decision-making process. Ineffective communication between scientists
   and environmental decision makers represents one of the key barriers
   limiting the integration of science into the decision-making process in
   many areas of natural resource management. This can be overcome by
   understanding the perceptions of end users, so as to identify knowledge
   gaps and develop improved and targeted strategies for communication and
   engagement. We assessed what one group of environmental decision makers,
   Australian marine protected area (MPA) managers, viewed as the major
   risks associated with climate change, and their perceptions regarding
   the role, importance, and achievability of adaptation for managing these
   risks. We also assessed what these managers perceived as the role of
   science in managing the risks from climate change, and identified the
   factors that increased their trust in scientific information. We do so
   by quantitatively surveying 30 MPA managers across 3 Australian
   management agencies. We found that although MPA managers have a very
   strong awareness of the range and severity of risks posed by climate
   change, their understanding of adaptation as an option for managing
   these risks is less comprehensive. We also found that although MPA
   managers view science as a critical source of information for informing
   the decision-making process, it should be considered in context with
   other knowledge types such as community and cultural knowledge, and be
   impartial, evidence based, and pragmatic in outlining policy and
   management recommendations that are realistically achievable.},

Abstract = {Populations in developing countries that are located in less-favored
   agricultural areas (LFAAs)- agricultural lands constrained by difficult
   terrain, poor soil quality, limited rainfall, etc. or with limited
   access to markets-and rural low-elevation coastal zones (LECZs)-coasts
   that have less than 10 meters elevation-are not only at risk from the
   most severe and long-lasting climate change impacts, they are also
   susceptible to poverty-environment traps (overreliance on marginal
   agricultural land and resource commons, which leads to stagnant, low
   incomes) that further increase their vulnerability to these impacts. We
   estimate that approximately 586 million people with high infant
   mortality live in LFAAs and 85 million with high infant mortality live
   in rural LECZs, although both of these populations declined between 2000
   and 2010. Nearly all of these people are in low-income or lower
   middle-income countries, with twenty countries accounting for most of
   the LFAA or rural LECZ populations with high infant mortality. We also
   examine the economic and environmental impacts of climate change on the
   rural poor in LFAAs and LECZs and discuss policy strategies for
   mitigating the impacts of climate change on poverty among rural
   households in LFAAs and LECZs.},

Title = {Options on Fisheries and Aquaculture for Coping with Climate Change in
   South Asia},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY IN SOUTH ASIA},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {359-376},
Abstract = {Fisheries and aquaculture have very important roles for food supply,
   food security and income generation in South Asia. About 7.5 million
   people work directly in the sector in this region, producing around 8.5
   million tonnes annually. Due to several reasons, production from
   fisheries is stagnant in the last ten years, and aquaculture is not
   expanding as anticipated. Climate change is projected to exacerbate this
   situation. The potential outcome for fisheries may be decrease in
   production and value of coastal and inland fisheries, and decline in the
   economic returns from fishing operations. The potential outcome for
   aquaculture may be higher capital, operating and insurance costs, loss
   of fish stocks, damage to facilities, conflict with other water users,
   reduced production capacity and increased per unit production costs.
   Despite the uncertainties and potential negative impacts of climate
   change on fisheries and aquaculture, there are opportunities to reduce
   the vulnerability to climate-related impacts. The following measures
   could contribute to coping with climate change: (i) evaluating the
   adaptive capacity of important fish groups; (ii) identifying adaptive
   fishing and post-harvest practices to sustain fish production and
   quality; (iii) supporting energy efficient fishing craft and gear; (iv)
   identifying new land use system for aquaculture; (v) identifying new
   candidate species and developing hatchery and grow-out technologies;
   (vi) cultivating aquatic algae, which have positive response to climate
   change for food and pharmaceutical purposes and for production of
   biodiesel; (vii) investigating the potential fish diseases in the
   natural and aquaculture systems; (viii) increasing climate literacy
   among the fishing and farming communities; (ix) establishing Weather
   Watch Groups; and (x) evolving decision support systems for fisheries
   and aquaculture in the region. It is also important to recognize the
   synergies between adaptive and mitigation options related to climate
   change and non-climatic factors such as responsible fisheries, and
   ecofriendly aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Embracing appropriate management strategies to ensure the sustainability
   of groundwater resource under climate is decisive for tropical karst
   islands. In this study, long term impacts of climate variability on
   groundwater recharge and discharge at the Oemau spring, Rote Island,
   Indonesia using HadCM3-GCM predictor variables for the H3A2a and H3B2a
   climate scenarios were investigated. The analysis suggests that the
   sustainability of groundwater resources generally varies over the period
   and will be adversely affected by climate change during dry years when
   the area is projected to experience supply shortage of around 29-67 L/s
   as a result of 5.24-23.63\% decrease of rainfall, 2.48-24.57\% reduction
   of recharge, and 2.53-22.80\% decrease of spring discharge, under HadCM3
   GCM scenarios. A subsequent comprehensive set of management strategies
   as palliative and adaptive efforts was proposed to be implemented by
   relevant stakeholders to assist the community dealing with water deficit

Title = {Drivers of European bat population change: a review reveals evidence
   gaps},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {353-368},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bat populations are thought to have suffered significant declines in the
   past century throughout Europe. Fortunately, there are some signs of
   recovery; for instance, of the 11 species monitored in the UK,
   population trends of five are increasing. The drivers of past losses and
   recent trends are unclear; identifying them will enable targeted
   conservation strategies to support further recovery.
   We review the evidence linking proposed drivers to impacts on bat
   populations in Europe, using the results of a previous cross-taxa
   semi-quantitative assessment as a framework. Broadly, the drivers
   reviewed relate to land-use practices, climate change, pollution,
   development and infrastructure, and human disturbance. We highlight
   where evidence gaps or conflicts present barriers to successful
   conservation and review emerging opportunities to address these gaps.
   We find that the relative importance or impacts of the potential drivers
   of bat population change are not well understood or quantified, with
   conflicting evidence in many cases. To close key gaps in the evidence
   for responses of bat populations to environmental change, future studies
   should focus on the impacts of climate change, urbanisation, offshore
   wind turbines, and water pollution, as well as on mitigation measures
   and the synergistic effects of putative drivers.
   To increase available evidence of drivers of bat population change, we
   propose utilising advances in monitoring tools and statistical methods,
   together with robust quantitative assessment of conservation
   interventions to mitigate threats and enable the effective conservation
   of these protected species.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {178+},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Documentary filmmakers have recently begun focusing on the vulnerable
   ecologies of low-lying islands, among them Briar March's There Once Was
   an Island and Jon Shenk's The Island President. The strength of
   documentary film is that it can make visible the gradual and
   long-distance ecological effects of climate change while also
   confronting viewers with the faces and voices of some of the human
   recipients of related forms of transnational environmental injustice and
   destruction. The two films highlight the diversity of small islands in
   environmental and social indicators and also focus on very different
   aspects of the affected communities' responses to climate-related
   disaster risk drivers. Whereas March uses a participant observation
   approach to highlight local adaptation practices and the threat of
   relocation, Shenk's fly-on-the-wall documentary offers viewers insights
   into Mohamed Nasheed's political battle to get the world leaders behind
   global mitigation practices that will help save the Maldives and other
   low-lying islands from submergence. They thereby remind their audiences
   that the world has a responsibility toward the inhabitants of small
   islands, exactly because they are at the forefront of global
   environmental change and therefore among those who bear the brunt of our
   collective carbon emissions.},

Abstract = {Coastal towns along the coast of Africa are among the most vulnerable to
   climate change impacts such as flooding and sea level rise. Yet, because
   coastal conditions in many parts of the region are poorly understood,
   knowledge on which population groups are at the most risk is less known,
   particularly in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) of Ghana,
   where the capital city Accra is located. Without adequate information
   about the risk levels and why, the implementation of locally appropriate
   adaptation plans may be less effective. This study enriches our
   understanding of the levels of flood risks along the coast of GAMA and
   contributes knowledge to improve understanding of place-specific
   adaptation plans. The study uses data from a 300-household survey,
   stakeholder meetings, and interviews with local community leaders to
   construct an integrated vulnerability index. The index includes seven
   components made up of: dwelling type; house and house environment;
   household socioeconomic characteristics; experience and perception of
   flood risk; household and community flood adaptation strategies; house
   location, and physical characteristics. Our findings show that exposure
   to floods, particularly from local flash floods is relatively high in
   all communities. However, significant differences in sensitivity and
   adaptive capacity of the communities were observed due to differences in
   location, socioeconomic characteristics, and perception of risks to
   flooding and sea level rise. The complexity of factors involved in the
   determination of local-level vulnerability requires that the
   implementation of adaptation strategies needs to involve cross-sectorial
   partnerships, involving local communities, in building a comprehensive
   multi-risk adaptation strategy.},

   planning in traditional owner narratives},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change is disproportionally affecting Indigenous peoples'
   livelihoods across the globe. Despite this fact, climate adaptation
   planning and responses are not immediate concerns for most Indigenous
   people, whose key challenges are deeply embedded in colonial history.
   Through collaborative research centred on climate adaptation planning
   with the Yuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owner groups on the Great
   Barrier Reef catchments, we demonstrate that Traditional Owners' primary
   concerns are in aligning the climate adaptation opportunity with their

Title = {Stakeholders' Perceptions of Nature-Based Solutions for Hurricane Risk
   Reduction Policies in the Mexican Caribbean},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NbSs) have long recognized the value of coastal
   and marine ecosystem management and associated ecosystem services as
   useful tools for climate change mitigation (e.g., blue carbon) and
   adaptation (e.g., coastal protection against flooding and storm surges).
   However, NbSs remain poorly acknowledged and mostly absent from coastal
   planning for disaster risk reduction policies in the Caribbean, as well
   as from ex-post disaster reconstruction funds. With the increasing
   frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the region, NbSs are now more
   needed than ever. Taking Mexico as a representative case study for the
   wider Caribbean, we here seek to identify and analyze the barriers and
   opportunities perceived by relevant stakeholders for mainstreaming
   coastal-marine NbSs into coastal management and disaster risk reduction
   policies (e.g., mangroves as green infrastructure) to protect coastal
   societies and national economies against hurricanes. We conduct
   semi-structured, in-depth interviews with twenty stakeholders covering
   academic, governmental, tourism, NGO, coastal planning, and financial
   domains. Among the twenty-three identified barriers, governance,
   institutional, financial, and human-capacity aspects are the most
   dominant perceptions behind the current lack of NbS implementation.
   Future action for the policy integration of NbSs requires widespread
   political will and better quantification of both the provision of
   ecosystem services and their economic benefits under conventional
   markets.},

Abstract = {Alternative ecosystem valuation methodology can inform policy choices to
   better reflect local needs, improve living standards and facilitate more
   effective climate change adaptation strategies. In the context of the
   South Pacific Island Countries and their reliance on marine resources,
   this paper outlines the urgent need for exploring alternative ecosystem
   valuation methodology. The objective behind alternative ecosystem
   valuation methodology is to enable a more comprehensive identification
   and elicitation of the various types of ecosystem values. This paper
   demonstrates how the commonly adopted monetary approach to conducting
   ecosystem valuation impedes the exploration of climate change adaptation
   strategies based on non-monetary aspects. These include value-indicators
   such as time, labour, geographical distance and collective community
   efforts along with social value, e.g. community incentives to protect
   and sustain local ecosystems. The paper compares and contrasts various
   combinations of ecosystem valuation methods that can enable social and
   non-monetary valuation of ecosystems in low-income settings that reflect
   social norms and cultural value systems. The paper concludes with a
   discussion of how alternative ecosystem valuation methodology can enable
   new pathways towards climate change adaptation and the improvement of
   living standards that would be particularly suitable for low-income
   settings where natural resources are vulnerable and financial resources
   scarce. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The role of human activities in degradation of estuarine resources has
   been well documented. Besides the effects of climate change, activities
   such as clearing of mangroves for tourism, use of inappropriate fishing
   gear and excessive use of pesticides for agricultural productivity are
   the most powerful ecological stressors. In the Sahelian climate zone,
   hydrological regimes are changing due to reduced river flow and increase
   in atmospheric temperatures leading to the formation of inverse
   estuaries. The evaluation and documentation of local adaptation
   practices is one way to prevent ``conservation bottlenecks{''} and
   encourage sustainable use of estuarine resources. This study used a
   questionnaire-based approach to evaluate local adaptation strategies to
   climate-induced ecological changes in the Tanbi Wetland National Park
   (TWNP) over the past three decades, targeting the communities that are
   engaged in the four major socio-economic sectors in the wetland i.e.
   Fishing, Agriculture, Oyster collection and Tourism. The agricultural
   zone presented the best local adaptation techniques employed as a
   response to ecosystem changes in the TWNP (23.53 \%), followed by
   tourism zones (7.35 \%) and fishing (5.88 \%). With the disappearance of
   many fish species within the same timeframe, this leaves much to be
   desired. Bearing in mind that fisheries and tourism are the second and
   third largest contributors to the Gambia's GDP, this paper provides
   useful recommendations for management of this important wetland.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) effect is considered to be one of the key
   indicators of the impacts of urbanization and the climate changes on the
   environment. Thus, the growing interest in studying the impacts of
   urbanization on changes in land surface temperature (LST). The
   literature on LST indicates the need for more studies on the
   relationship between changes in LST and land use types, especially in
   the arid environment. This paper examines the spatial and temporal
   changes in land surface temperature influenced by land use/land cover
   types in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Multi-temporal Landsat images of the
   study area, 1985, 1995, 2002 and 2015, were processed to derive land
   surface temperatures. UHI index was computed for the different land
   use/land cover types (high-density residential, medium-density
   residential, low-density residential, industrial, vegetation, and
   desert) in the study area. The results indicate a trend of rising
   temperatures in all the land use types in the study area. This is
   probably due to climate change. The industrial area has the highest
   temperatures among the land use types. The lowest temperatures are found
   in the vegetation area as expected. There is a need to implement
   mitigating measures to reduce the effects of rising temperatures in the
   study area.},

Title = {The role of interactions in a world implementing adaptation and

Volume = {369},

Abstract = {The papers in this volume discuss projections of climate change impacts
   upon humans and ecosystems under a global mean temperature rise of 4
   degrees C above preindustrial levels. Like most studies, they are mainly
   single-sector or single-region-based assessments. Even the multi-sector
   or multi-region approaches generally consider impacts in sectors and
   regions independently, ignoring interactions. Extreme weather and
   adaptation processes are often poorly represented and losses of
   ecosystem services induced by climate change or human adaptation are
   generally omitted. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing some
   potential interactions in a 4 degrees C world, and also makes a
   comparison with a 2 degrees C world. In a 4 degrees C world, major
   shifts in agricultural land use and increased drought are projected, and
   an increased human population might increasingly be concentrated in
   areas remaining wet enough for economic prosperity. Ecosystem services
   that enable prosperity would be declining, with carbon cycle feedbacks
   and fire causing forest losses. There is an urgent need for integrated
   assessments considering the synergy of impacts and limits to adaptation
   in multiple sectors and regions in a 4 degrees C world. By contrast, a 2
   degrees C world is projected to experience about one-half of the climate
   change impacts, with concomitantly smaller challenges for adaptation.
   Ecosystem services, including the carbon sink provided by the Earth's
   forests, would be expected to be largely preserved, with much less
   potential for interaction processes to increase challenges to
   adaptation. However, demands for land and water for biofuel cropping
   could reduce the availability of these resources for agricultural and
   natural systems. Hence, a whole system approach to mitigation and
   adaptation, considering interactions, potential human and species
   migration, allocation of land and water resources and ecosystem
   services, will be important in either a 2 degrees C or a 4 degrees C
   world.},

Abstract = {The coastal morphology of Bangladesh influences the impact of natural
   hazards on the area. Especially, in the southwestern area, natural
   hazards increase the vulnerability of the coastal dwellers and slow down
   the process of social and economic developments. There is a serious need
   for an effective disaster management plan to minimize the loss of lives
   and property. Unfortunately, the present cyclone warning signal is not
   only highly ineffective, but, sometimes also confusing. There is no
   comprehensive disaster management strategy. Some of the local NGOs in
   collaboration with government agencies undertake certain activities, but
   these too have been limited to mostly relief and rehabilitation. Cyclone
   preparedness plans are hardly found among these agencies. While it is
   not possible to prevent natural disasters, protective measures to reduce
   the vagaries of disasters can be evolved. Due to the unusual climatic
   behaviour in recent years, people in coastal areas face serious
   vulnerability, especially in the context of human settlements and
   consequently move out to the cities to combat the situation. These
   people need innovative strategies for survival. This paper assert, like
   many other newly devised coping strategies, that reducing
   vulnerabilities is important and suggest where innovation \& adaptation
   is necessary to save communities from their vulnerability to climate
   change. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Efficiency of green roofs and green walls as climate change mitigation
   measures in extremely hot and dry climate: Case study of Qatar},

Abstract = {The main goal of this study is to assess the potential of green roofs
   and walls as a mitigation measure for the climate-change-driven growth
   of building energy consumption in extremely hot climates. A
   comprehensive, interdisciplinary methodology was developed that bridged
   climate change and building modeling. The residential building stock of
   Qatar was considered, with a two-story residential villa selected as a
   representative of the stock and consequently a case study. Weather
   scenarios were created for the years 2020, 2050, and 2080, and four
   building renovation scenarios were developed. The findings suggested
   that without any mitigation measures, residential building energy
   consumption in Qatar could increase by up to 9\%, 17\%, and 30\% in
   2020, 2050, and 2080, respectively. The addition of 5-cm expanded
   polystyrene and the installation of energy-efficient windows proved to
   be far more efficient than the addition of green walls and roofs under
   the climate conditions (30\% reduction in energy consumption vs. 3\%).
   Additionally, the environmental impact of green wall and roof
   maintenance, specific to Qatar, should be considered. However, in the
   final judgment, other positive effects of a green infrastructure (such
   as the effect on air quality, heat island effect, and health of the
   inhabitants) should be considered. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The recruitment of anadromous brown trout smolt from a small Baltic
   stream, frequently exposed to summer drought, was quantified for 9
   years, and the effect from drought on smolt number and age composition
   analysed. Drought was quantified by, (a) a newly developed index
   quantifying the severity of summer drought (Drought Severity
   Index-DSI-based on amount of precipitation, monthly mean temperature and
   number of hours with sun), and (b) the amount of precipitation. Both DSI
   and precipitation were measured 1 or 2 years prior to emigration. We
   found highly significant (negative) relations between DSI (1 year before
   emigration) and both the total number of smolt, and the number of age 1
   smolt. In addition, precipitation was (positively) related to total
   number of smolt, but DSI proved to be a stronger predictor compared to
   precipitation. In addition to drought, our results support a negative
   influence from older parr on the survival of age 0 trout. Our results
   indicate that recruitment of brown trout smolt from streams, regularly
   affected by summer drought, may be predicted approx. 6 months before the
   actual emigration the following spring. This offers an opportunity for
   managers to adapt protective measures in accordance with local and
   temporal changes in recruitment.},

Title = {Water security in small island developing states: the limited utility of
   evolving governance paradigms},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-193},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Despite decades of donor support for the water sector, many small island
   developing states (SIDS) have failed to make acceptable levels of
   progress toward achievement of water-related millennium development
   goals and reduction of water-related risks. At least three distinct
   policy paradigms have at different times been regarded as best practice
   for responding to water insecurity throughout the world. Yet, while the
   water management literature points to the need for a paradigm shift
   toward improved governance approaches, there has been little critical
   examination of whether the assumptions implicit within these theoretical
   paradigms are applicable to SIDS contexts. This study reviews the water
   management, governance, and island studies literatures to identify the
   ways in which the unique historical, geographical, and economic contexts
   of SIDS limit or enable the applicability of these paradigms. The
   analysis shows that each paradigm has a different underlying
   conceptualization of governance, and how institutions can regulate
   social-ecological relations for achieving water security. The
   conceptualizations of governance under the adaptive management paradigm
   seem to most closely reflect the complexity of governance in SIDS, and
   may therefore hold the most potential for addressing water insecurity.
   However, the analysis also highlights the need for further research to
   test the application of adaptive management in a way that can also cater
   for the unique socio-political relations that affect the outcomes of
   governance in SIDS. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Since their introduction 40 years ago, worldwide interest in urban
   climatic map (UCMap) studies has grown. Today, there are over 15
   countries around the world processing their own climatic maps,
   developing urban climatic guidelines, and implementing mitigation
   measures for local planning practices. Facing the global issue of
   climate change, it is also necessary to include the changing climatic
   considerations holistically and strategically in the planning process,
   and to update city plans. This paper reviews progress in UCMap studies.
   The latest concepts, key methodologies, selected parameters, map
   structure, and the procedures of making UCMaps are described in the
   paper. The mitigation measures inspired by these studies and the
   associated urban climatic planning recommendations are also examined.
   More than 30 relevant studies around the world have been cited, and both
   significant developments and existing problems are discussed. The
   thermal environment and air ventilation condition within the urban
   canopy layer (UCL) of the city are important in the analytical processes
   of the climatic-environmental evaluation. Possible mitigation measures
   and planned actions include decreasing anthropogenic heat release,
   improving air ventilation at the pedestrian level, providing more shaded
   areas, increasing greenery, creating air paths, and controlling building
   morphologies. Further developments have and will continue to focus on
   the spatial analysis of human thermal comfort in urban outdoor
   environments and on the impacts and adaptations of climate change.
   Mapmakers must continue to share lessons and experiences with city
   planners and policy makers, especially in the rapidly expanding cities
   of developing countries and regions. Copyright (c) 2010 Royal

Abstract = {Climate change has added a new layer to the existing challenges in
   Africa that adaptation is high on the development agenda. Adaptation is
   necessary to build resilience of cities' response to climate change.
   Inland, coastal and mountainous cities face different climate risks
   ranging from storm surges, droughts, excessive rainfall, heat waves and
   cold waves. The impacts also range from flooding, storm surges, water
   scarcity and landslides. The urgency of climate change adaptation
   promises to revitalize practice in urban development around which
   innovations in planning, institutional readiness and community
   resilience are crucial to successful adaptation. Being an inland city,
   Kampala experiences increased frequency of floods with associated
   impacts on health, infrastructure and human settlements. Building on
   early and scalable adaptation measures is paramount to enable
   communities, institutions, urban authorities and different actors become
   climate ready while addressing the inherent challenges. In Kampala,
   community adaptation offers lessons but the requirement for scaling up
   needs urgent attention by city authorities and government for widespread
   adaptation.},

Title = {Differing spatial patterns of the urban heat exposure of elderly
   populations in two megacities identifies alternate adaptation strategies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {781},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Mapping the elderly population exposure to heat hazard in urban areas is
   important to inform adaptation strategies for increasingly-deadly urban
   heat under climate change. However, fine-scale mapping is lacking,
   because global climate change projections have not previously been
   integrated with urban heat island effects especially with urban
   three-dimensional characteristics for within-city heat risk analyses.
   This study compared the spatial patterns of deadly heat exposure for
   elderly populations in two East Asian megacities, Seoul and Tokyo, using
   current climate (2006-2015) and two future periods (2040s and 2090s). We
   integrated global warming projections (the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway
   5 based on Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) with local urban
   characteristics and demographics. We found that, for the historical
   period, the overall hotspots of elderly population exposure to urban
   heat was larger in Tokyo because of relatively higher maximum air
   temperatures and lack of green spaces, whereas in the future periods,
   Seoul will have larger hotspots because the elderly population density
   will have increased. About 20\% of the area in Seoul and 0.3-1\% of
   Tokyo will be hotpots in the 2040s, and the size of these hotspots
   increases to 25-26\% and 2-3\%, respectively, in the 2090s. The spatial
   patterns of hotspots identify different types of priority areas and
   suggest that alternative adaptation strategies for two cities are
   appropriate. The approach introduced here will be useful for identifying
   sustainable thermal environments in other cities with high density
   elderly population and severe heat hazard.

Abstract = {Mollymook, Collingwood and Callala beaches and the communities living
   near them were identified as especially vulnerable to sea level rise by
   the Shoalhaven City Council. A number of possible engineering and
   management solutions have been identified for mitigating or eliminating
   the effects of expected flooding and erosion (e.g., sea wall, groyne,
   beach nourishment), based on guidelines developed by Engineers
   Australia. However, the question remains as to how to assess and compare
   the benefits (and not just the costs) of each option. While the cost of
   designing and implementing these options are reasonably easy to
   estimate, other environmental and aesthetic costs are more difficult to
   valuate. Even more challenging is quantifying in monetary terms the
   benefits of each option. Methods are available in the economic
   literature for estimating some of these parameters, however, their
   application requires data and resources that are not always available to
   local government.
   In this study, we propose a pragmatic approach (relatively simple yet
   detailed) which combines a monetarybased probabilistic flood-damage
   estimation technique with an estimate of non-monetary consequences of an
   adaptation option using local knowledge and stakeholder consultation.
   These two types of information (monetary and non-monetary) are combined
   using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods in order to
   generate a ranking of engineering adaptation options and assist in
   decision-making. We illustrate the method by applying to Callala beach
   in Shoalhaven. First, we calculate respective cost-benefit ratios of
   each option by simulating the likely effects of a flood event (with
   multiple probabilities of occurrence or return period) with and without
   proposed adaptation options, for different scenarios of sea level rise.
   Specifically, a flood model of Callala is developed using high
   resolution LiDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and tested for
   impacts under different sea level rise scenarios (using IPCC AR5
   projections) and their corresponding exceedance probabilities (using
   Canute sea level rise calculator). Second, we estimate the potential
   damage to properties and infrastructures (cumulative over time) through
   flood damage function curves (quantifying the relationship between flood
   depth and potential damage cost of private properties and public
   infrastructure). Third, we estimate the non-monetary benefits of each
   option using a simplified approach, based on stakeholder consultation.
   Finally, we use two different multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)
   approaches (simple additive weight and outranking methods) for
   comparison of a number of engineering adaptation options (both hard and
   soft measures). Results show that, in general, a combination of beach
   nourishment \& groynes is the most preferred option for Callala beach,
   across all decision analysis methods. Our analyses also show that hard
   measures such as sea walls tend to perform better in cost-benefit
   analyses where non-monetary factors such as community preferences,
   aesthetics and environmental factors are omitted. On the other hand,
   including these factors through MCDA methods seems to push sea walls
   down the rank.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change on an urban scale is important, as
   increases in temperature will be inevitable according to future climate
   scenarios. In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations
   are performed for the Bergpolder Zuid district in Rotterdam, the
   Netherlands. The simulations take into account wind flow, solar
   radiation, heat transfer and evaporative cooling. Two validation studies
   are performed; one for the surface temperatures and one for the
   evaporative cooling model. In the final stage, three water ponds are
   added to the domain and a comparative study is performed. It is
   concluded that evaporative cooling can reduce the air temperature at
   pedestrian height (1.8 meter) by 0.9 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C.},

Abstract = {The National Adaptation Framework aims to reduce Ireland's vulnerability
   to climate change by establishing climate adaptation considerations as a
   priority at local, regional and national level. With coastal areas and
   habitats particularly susceptible to negative climate change effects, it
   is necessary to build resilience in these areas by devising coastal
   adaptation responses in collaboration with coastal communities. Policies
   and structures have also been put in place to create an enabling
   environment which facilitates community participation. However, the
   extent of community engagement and its current role in formulating and
   implementing coastal adaptation responses are unclear. This paper
   assesses the effectiveness of the enabling environment in encouraging
   community-led coastal adaptation solutions by identifying community and
   voluntary groups who are actively engaging with stakeholders at all
   levels of governance in key adaptation tasks. The findings reveal that
   the policies and structures for enhanced local participation in coastal
   adaptation responses are in place, but as only a small number of
   communities are actively engaging in coastal adaptation solutions,
   further progress in their implementation is needed.},

Title = {Assessing social-ecological vulnerability of coastal systems to fishing

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {784},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Detecting areas with high social-ecological vulnerability (SEV) is
   essential to better inform management interventions for building
   resilience in coastal systems. The SEV framework, developed by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is a robust method to
   identify SEV of tropical coastal systems to climate change. Yet, the
   application of this framework to temperate regions and other drivers of
   change remains underexplored. This study operationalizes the SEV
   framework to assess the social-ecological implications of fishing and
   tourism in temperate coastal systems. We spatially represented the SEV
   of coastal systems and identified the social and ecological
   vulnerability dimensions underpinning this SEV. Our results demonstrate
   that different dimensions contribute differently to the SEV, suggesting
   the need for distinctive management intervention to reduce the
   vulnerability of coastal systems. Our findings also highlight that
   livelihood diversification and the protection of marine areas may be
   plausible strategies to build resilience in temperate coastal systems
   that face fishing and tourism pressures. With this study, we hope to
   encourage the application of the SEV framework to other drivers of
   change for building more resilient coastal systems.

Abstract = {Climate change can alter conditions that sustain food production and
   availability, with cascading consequences for food security and global

   scenario, similar to 90\% of the world's population-most of whom live in
   the most sensitive and least developed countries-are projected to be
   exposed to losses of food production in both sectors, while less than
   3\% would live in regions experiencing simultaneous productivity gains
   by 2100. Under a strong mitigation scenario comparable to achieving the
   Paris Agreement, most countries-including the most vulnerable and many
   of the largest CO2 producers-would experience concomitant net gains in
   agriculture and fisheries production. Reducing societies' vulnerability
   to future climate impacts requires prompt mitigation actions led by
   major CO2 emitters coupled with strategic adaptation within and across

   systems},
Journal = {EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-45},
Abstract = {Despite improved scientific insight into physical and social dynamics
   related to natural disasters, the financial cost of extreme events
   continues to rise. This paradox is particularly evident along developed
   coastlines, where future hazards are projected to intensify with
   consequences of climate change, and where the presence of valuable
   infrastructure exacerbates risk. By design, coastal hazard mitigation
   buffers human activities against the variability of natural phenomena
   such as storms. But hazard mitigation also sets up feed-backs between
   human and natural dynamics. This paper explores developed coastlines as
   exemplary coupled human-environmental systems in which hazard mitigation
   is the key coupling mechanism. Results from a simplified numerical model
   of an agent-managed seawall illustrate the nonlinear effects that
   economic and physical thresholds can impart into coastal
   human-environmental system dynamics. The scale of mitigation action
   affects the time frame over which human activities and natural hazards
   interact. By accelerating environmental changes observable in some
   settings over human timescales of years to decades, climate change may
   temporarily strengthen the coupling between human and environmental
   dynamics. However, climate change could ultimately result in weaker
   coupling at those human timescales as mitigation actions increasingly
   engage global-scale systems.},

Abstract = {Weather conditions that influence natural resource-based tourist
   destinations are likely to be affected by climate change, but our
   understanding of how businesses and destinations manage for present and
   future conditions is limited. In this study we report on the
   relationships between weather and tourism activities in the
   Queenstown-Lake Wanaka region, South Island, New Zealand. Key
   stakeholder interviews and a workshop form the empirical basis of this
   paper. Coping range application ideas derived from ecological management
   literature are used to develop a framework to understand and inform
   thinking and strategies around how tourism businesses and destinations
   are currently responding to the weather and perhaps could in future
   respond to climate change. Results show that within a destination
   individual businesses have widely varying relationships with the
   weather, with each type of activity operating within its own coping
   range to particular environmental gradients, for example temperature.
   Coping, which can be observed outside the `ideal' range of a particular
   environmental gradient, requires business adjustments so as to cope with
   increasingly marginal conditions, up to a Critical Stop Point - the
   ultimate threshold. The data suggest that increased need for adjustments
   impacts on business viability, and more planned adaptation measures
   would be necessary to increase viability under increasingly detrimental
   climatic conditions. Discussion at a destination level workshop
   indicates that at and beyond thresholds, keystone industry and
   destination level strategic adaptation planning is required to ensure

Abstract = {Local residents, businesspeople, and policymakers engaged in climate
   change adaptation often think differently of the time available for
   action. Their understandings of time, and their practices that invoke
   time, form the complex and sometimes conflicting temporalities of
   adaptation to environmental change. They link the conditions of the past
   to those of the present and the future in a variety of ways, and their
   contemporary practices rest on such linking explicitly or implicitly.
   Yet the temporal connections between the present and distant future of
   places are undertheorized and poorly considered in the science and
   policy of adaptation to environmental change. In this article we address
   this theoretical and practical challenge by weaving together arguments
   from social and environmental geography with evidence from small coastal
   communities in southeastern Australia. We show that the past conditions
   residents' imagined futures and that these local, imagined futures are
   incongruent with scientific, popular, and policy accounts of the future.
   Thus we argue that the temporalities of adaptation include
   incommensurate and unacknowledged ways of knowing and that these affect
   adaptation practices. We propose that strategies devised by governments
   for adapting to environmental change need to make visible-and calibrate
   policies with-the diverse temporalities of adaptation. On this basis,
   the times between the present and the long-term future can be better
   navigated as a series of short and negotiated policy steps.},

Title = {Ecosystem-based adaptation in cities: Use of formal and informal
   planning instruments},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {109},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and heat waves will likely
   increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change. As the
   impacts of these extremes are particularly prominent in urban
   agglomerations, cities face an urgent need to develop adaptation
   strategies. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) provides helpful strategies
   that harness ecological processes in addition to technical
   interventions. EbA has been addressed in informal adaptation planning.
   Formal municipality planning, namely landscape planning, is supposed to
   include traditionally some EbA measures, although adaptation has not
   been their explicit focus. Our research aims to investigate how
   landscape plans incorporate climate-related extremes and EbA as well as
   to discuss the potential to enhance EbA uptake in formal planning. We
   conducted a document analysis of informal planning documents from 85
   German cities and the analysis of formal landscape plans of 61 of these
   cities. The results suggest that city size does affect the extent of
   informal planning instruments and the comprehensiveness of formal
   landscape plans. Climate-related extremes and EbA measures have
   traditionally been part of landscape planning. Almost all landscape
   plans address heat stress, while climate change and heavy rain have been
   addressed less often, though more frequently since 2008. Greening of
   walls and roofs, on-site infiltration and water retention reveal
   significant potential for better integration in landscape plans.
   Landscape planning offers an entry point for effective climate
   adaptation through EbA in cities. Informal and formal planning
   instruments should be closely combined for robust, spatially explicit,
   legally binding implementation of EbA measures in the future.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {38-49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A global effort is underway by scientists, stakeholders, resource
   managers, and multisectoral ministerial representatives (e.g. fisheries,
   transportation, mining, energy, tourism, environment) from 110
   economically developing countries to implement ecosystem-based
   management at the Large Marine Ecosystem scale. The effort is supported
   with \$3.1 billion in financial assistance from the Global Environmental
   Facility and World Bank to assess and manage goods and services of Large
   Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) along the coasts of economically developing
   countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. Through a
   systematic spatial and temporal scaling across multiple jurisdictions
   (e.g. community, municipal, regional, national, and international) a
   generic suite of indicators is applied to monitor the annual changes in
   LME productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution and ecosystem health,
   socioeconomics, and governance. Ecosystem-based governance practices are
   being implemented by Commissions that serve as institutional frameworks
   for restoring and sustaining transboundary LME goods and services. Under
   activities guided by LME Commissions, the suites of indicators are
   analyzed in relation to drivers of change and the results are applied to
   adaptive management regimes to reduce coastal pollution, restore damaged
   habitats, recover depleted fisheries conserve biodiversity, control
   nutrient over-enrichment and ocean acidification, and mitigate and adapt
   to the effects of climate warming. Application of ecosystem-based
   adaptive management practices presently underway by the People's
   Republic of China and the Republic of Korea are discussed for the Yellow
   Sea LME. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The origins and expansion of Gravettian industries in Western Europe
   have recently been considered a cultural mosaic phenomena marked by
   regional technological facies. Probably associated with climatic
   oscillations, the development of these facies is likely related to
   sociocultural patterns and human adaptations to different ecological
   niches. Thereby, changes of subsistence strategies and mobility patterns
   are also reflected by technological and typological adaptations and
   innovations within the lithic assemblages. With the Iberian Peninsula
   being an important ecological niche for studying these phenomena, we
   conducted a comparative analysis of two occupations to test human
   ecological and lithic technological adaptations during the early
   Gravettian in Iberia: Cueto de la Mina on the northern Iberian Atlantic
   coast and Vale Boi on the western Portuguese Atlantic coast. Results
   show that these occupations exhibit major technological differences, but
   also strong similarities in the case of typological
   innovation/adaptation, possibly related to local resource accessibility
   (e.g. high-quality raw material). Based on these observations, the study
   provides further information concerning possible connections throughout
   the Iberian Atlantic coastline during an early Gravettian timeframe. (C)

Abstract = {This is a small building of humble origins but in a dominant position at
   the centre of a picturesque riverside village in Cornwall. It had been
   at risk for some years before the owners declared that they wished to
   sell. At this point, the local community (through the parish councils
   for each side of the river) combined to preserve the building for
   general use. Despite the modest scale of the project, significant
   volunteer effort resulted in grant aid from a variety of sources
   including the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and the Regional Development
   Fund (RDF). The building was in a state of considerable disrepair; roof
   failure and regular tidal flooding from the river had caused the
   original timbers to rot, which had led to some stonework movement. Thus
   the aims were twofold: to conserve the original building, and to create
   a useful functional space for the benefit of the local community.
   This paper describes how the Red Store was conserved and converted to a
   resource centre and craft workshop for community use. It includes the
   flood mitigation measures taken to prevent damage from regular tidal
   flooding and potential future climate change.},

Abstract = {Recent large scale hurricanes and their associated damage to bridges
   have demonstrated the need to include such extreme events in the design
   and performance assessment of coastal bridges. Coastal zones are
   vulnerable to accelerated sea level rise due to anthropogenic climate
   changes, and the structures and infrastructure systems become
   increasingly vulnerable. This paper investigates the performance of
   coastal bridges under climate change effect with an emphasis on sea
   level rise and hurricanes. Simply-supported low-clearance coastal
   bridges are subjected to extreme hydraulic forces during hurricanes that
   may dislodge the superstructure from its supports. Adaptation measures
   are applied to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. For
   coastal bridges, this includes measures that reduce hydraulic loads or
   increase capacity to withstand the loads. A quantitative assessment of
   the site-specific climate change effects on the performance of a typical
   coastal bridge located in a hurricane prone region in New Jersey is
   performed.},

Title = {The adaptation towards climate change impacts among islanders in
   Malaysia},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {699},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {The climate change phenomenon has been occurring in every part of the
   world, including Malaysia. In particular, changes such as rising
   temperature, sea level rise, and unstable rain pattern are proven to
   affect the socio-economic routine of the community. Hence, it is
   necessary to learn how to adapt to it, especially those who heavily rely
   on nature stability. The present study examined the adaptation towards
   climate change among islanders in Malaysia. In addition, the current
   research was performed quantitatively using a developed questionnaire as
   the main data collection tool. In this case, a total of 400 islanders
   were selected as the respondents through a multi-stage sampling
   technique. The results revealed that the respondents recorded a moderate
   to high mean score for adaptation aspects namely awareness, dependency

   highlighted can be utilized as a basis to develop community adaptation
   policy that is in line with the islanders' need, ability, and interests.

Title = {The urban heat island effect, its causes, and mitigation, with reference

Abstract = {The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a phenomenon that affects many millions
   of people worldwide. The higher temperatures experienced in urban areas
   compared to the surrounding countryside has enormous consequences for
   the health and wellbeing of people living in cities. The increased use
   of manmade materials and increased anthropogenic heat production are the
   main causes of the UHI. This has led to the understanding that increased
   urbanisation is the primary cause of the urban heat island. The UHI
   effect also leads to increased energy needs that further contribute to
   the heating of our urban landscape, and the associated environmental and
   public health consequences. Pavements and roofs dominate the urban
   surface exposed to solar irradiation. This review article outlines the
   contribution that pavements make to the UHI effect and analyses
   localized and citywide mitigation strategies against the UHI. Asphalt
   Concrete (AC) is one of the most common pavement surfacing materials and
   is a significant contributor to the UHI. Densely graded AC has low
   albedo and high volumetric heat capacity, which results in surface
   temperatures reaching upwards of 60 degrees C on hot summer days.
   Cooling the surface of a pavement by utilizing cool pavements has been a
   consistent theme in recent literature. Cool pavements can be reflective
   or evaporative. However, the urban geometry and local atmospheric
   conditions should dictate whether or not these mitigation strategies
   should be used. Otherwise both of these pavements can actually increase
   the UHI effect. Increasing the prevalence of green spaces through the
   installation of street trees, city parks and rooftop gardens has
   consistently demonstrated a reduction in the UHI effect. Green spaces
   also increase the cooling effect derived from water and wind sources.
   This literature review demonstrates that UHI mitigation techniques are
   best used in combination with each other. As a result of the study, it
   was concluded that the current mitigation measures need development to
   make them relevant to various climates and throughout the year. There
   are also many possible sources of future study, and alternative measures
   for mitigation have been described, thereby providing scope for future
   research and development following this review. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Urban development has to meet the challenge of establishing adaptation
   strategies in response to climate change. In view of its potential to
   regulate urban climates, green infrastructure will assume a critical
   role in these strategies. In addition to their positive microclimatic
   effects, as a source of cooling in dense, hot cities urban green spaces
   can contribute to mitigation. They can operate as carbon sinks or can
   reduce energy consumption for air conditioning by providing shade by
   urban trees or roof-top greenery. Thus, urban green spaces should be
   incorporated as a significant component into both adaptation and
   mitigation strategies. This paper focuses on the potentials and
   constraints of various types and structures of urban green spaces and
   vegetation in influencing climatic conditions in urban areas. It
   examines the ability of urban green spaces to counter the urban heat
   island effect and other impacts of climate change. The scientific
   findings discussed are based on urban vegetation analysis and climate
   modelling as well as analysis of planning approaches and instruments in
   German cities. They will be analysed in the context of the future
   relevance of greens spaces, and within the framework of current urban
   planning and development mechanisms.},

Title = {On the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States: A dynamic
   analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {382-392},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are generally considered highly
   vulnerable to climate change because they suffer from most common
   environmental problems due to their smallness, remoteness and exposure
   to natural hazards, though they contribute less to climate change.
   However, international cooperation can improve the negative impacts of
   climate change by incentivizing adaptation policies. The vulnerability
   assessment becomes crucial because it can be used to allocate the
   international cooperation resources targeted to adaptation plans.
   The aim of this paper is to assess of the vulnerability in Small Island
   Developing States.
   Using a comprehensive dataset including 32 variables, we synthetize the
   vulnerability. with a composite indicator. Then, we analyze the
   vulnerability's dynamics over time from 2009 to 2014. Lastly, we explore
   the dimensions of vulnerability to assess those that have a greater
   weight on overall vulnerability. Our findings show that the
   vulnerability of Small Island Developing States is partly driven by
   common characteristics, such as isolation and extreme exposure to the
   effects of climate change, but the degree of vulnerability of identified
   dimensions is different among countries. Our results give indications to
   better target development aid, giving suggestions on the more relevant
   dimensions for action to reduce the vulnerability of each country.},

Title = {Maneuvering towards adaptive co-management in a coral reef fishery},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {77-84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tropical coral reef ecosystems in the Pacific region are degrading
   rapidly as ocean temperatures rise and local anthropogenic stressors
   increase. In this context of rapid change, effective site-based
   management of coral reef fisheries necessitates flexible environmental
   governance that is closely attuned to the needs of multiple stakeholders
   who depend on the fishery for income, food, and cultural identity. As
   such, many practitioners and scholars call for adaptive co-management of
   coral reef fisheries where local resource users play a primary role in
   environmental governance with the support of flexible institutions that
   operate across organizational scales. This article describes the history
   and evaluates the current status of marine governance in Moorea, French
   Polynesia. Established in 2004, the management framework is under
   revision because it has failed to meet its ecological objectives and has
   generated discontent among many stakeholders. Drawing on household
   surveys, interviews, and archival information, the challenges to as well
   as the factors that may enable a more successful transition of the
   current governance arrangement towards co-management are detailed. It is
   argued that recent social mobilization, subsistence and cultural links
   to the fishery, the presence of geographically and socially relevant
   traditional governance boundaries, and the implementation of
   co-management in other parts of French Polynesia are positive factors.
   However, lack of trust between stakeholders, social heterogeneity,
   disruption of traditional cultural institutions and practices, minimal
   institutional support, and an uncertain legal framework suggest that
   there are significant headwinds for maneuvering towards successful
   co-management in Moorea.},

Title = {Urban adaptation pathways at the edge of the anthropocene: lessons from
   the Blue Pacific Continent},
Journal = {URBAN GEOGRAPHY},
Abstract = {Pacific Island cities exhibit high levels of informality. In these
   spaces, traditional cultural practices and production converge with the
   periphery of global financial markets and systems of trade and
   production. These hybrid, nonconforming urban systems fall between
   regional policy agendas, requiring practitioners to embed urban
   considerations within broader regional platforms such as climate change.
   This paper demonstrates how these ``covert{''} processes are used to
   advance urban justice at a settlement scale, both within and in
   resistance to city-level resilience frameworks and governance. In
   addition to a wider review of secondary data and Pacific urban
   literature the authors - non-Indigenous Pacific urban experts - draw
   upon empirical evidence from climate resilient development initiatives
   across the region. This includes case studies from the two Vanuatu
   municipalities of Luganville and Port Vila, and Honiara, the capital of
   Solomon Islands. Approaches for negotiating divergences between these
   functional systems of traditional and state justice within the urban
   domain are proposed, particularly in relation to disaster response and
   climate resilient development. Adaptation pathways are also presented,
   that draw upon decolonized visions of Pacific cities. These build upon
   observations of endogenous resilience in Pacific informal settlements;
   imaginaries centered upon quasi-customary urban governance, social
   structures, and ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Considering the likely increase in coastal flooding in small island
   developing states (SIDSs) due to climate change, coastal managers at the
   local and global levels have been developing initiatives aimed at
   implementing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and adaptation measures.
   Developing science-based adaptation policies requires accurate coastal
   flood risk (CFR) assessments, which in the case of insular states are
   often subject to input uncertainty. We analysed the impact of a number
   of uncertain inputs on coastal flood damage estimates: (i) significant
   wave height, (ii) storm surge level and (iii) sea level rise (SLR)
   contributions to extreme sea levels, as well as the error-driven
   uncertainty in (iv) bathymetric and (v) topographic datasets, (vi)
   damage models, and (vii) socioeconomic changes. The methodology was
   tested through a sensitivity analysis using an ensemble of hydrodynamic
   models (XBeach and SFINCS) coupled with a direct impact model
   (Delft-FIAT) for a case study of a number of villages on the islands of
   Sao Tome and Principe. Model results indicate that for the current time
   horizon, depth damage functions (DDFs) and digital elevation models
   (DEMs) dominate the overall damage estimation uncertainty. When
   introducing climate and socioeconomic uncertainties to the analysis, SLR
   projections become the most relevant input for the year 2100 (followed
   by DEM and DDF). In general, the scarcity of reliable input data leads
   to considerable predictive uncertainty in CFR assessments in SIDSs. The
   findings of this research can help to prioritize the allocation of
   limited resources towards the acquisitions of the most relevant input
   data for reliable impact estimation.},

Title = {Does climate finance reduce vulnerability in Small Island Developing
   States? An empirical investigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {256},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {International climate funds play a key role in supporting the adaptation
   policies of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to climate change by
   reducing their vulnerability. The mechanism of contributions established
   at national level under the Paris Agreement of 2015 lays the foundations
   to help international donors better understand each country's climate
   needs. With this in mind, this paper aims to provide some policy
   suggestions emerging from the analysis of the impact some variables have
   on reducing vulnerability. To this end, we consider the vulnerability
   index of 33 SIDS countries in terms of adaptation and mitigation
   policies. Based on the data availability, we use the panel-corrected
   standard errors estimator in time span from 2010 to 2014, taking into
   account the spatial heterogeneity of vulnerability. Our findings display
   that foreign aid and social development variables are crucial to
   promoting adequate and balanced responses to climate change. Therefore,
   we can confirm the effectiveness of external funds in reducing
   vulnerability. Domestic resources alone do not appear able to help SIDS
   due to endogenous limits of countries beneficiaries. The approach
   proposed in this paper can be extended to other small countries which
   are not islands, as well as to islands that are not nations. (c) 2020

Title = {Perceptions of climate change and adaptation: A subarctic archipelago
   perspective (Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon, North America)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {215},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is projected to challenge adaptation capacity in small
   islands worldwide due to rising temperatures, sea-level rise, extreme
   events and changing rainfall patterns. However, adaptation planning and
   implementation may be delayed where people perceive a lack of urgency
   and put forward competing priorities such as economic development. Here,
   we assess perceptions of climate change and adaptation in
   Saint-Pierre-and Miquelon, a subarctic archipelago located south of
   Newfoundland, Canada. We performed and analysed a social survey reaching
   289 individuals out of a population of 6260, through a questionnaire
   conducted both faceto-face and online. We show that inhabitants of
   Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon generally have a clear understanding of
   climate change and perceive adaptation as urgent for a number of
   vulnerable coastal sites. Despite some disagreements on adaptation
   options and the timing for implementation, it is noteworthy that even
   relocation action is mentioned and sometimes requested. We show that
   perceptions of climate change and of adaptation within
   Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon are heavily influenced by place attachment,
   personal experience of coastal hazards and environmental awareness. From
   a methodological point of view, our results highlight the relevance of
   using online surveys in well-connected but geographically isolated
   communities. From an adaptation perspective, our results suggest that
   people's perceptions and beliefs are not only a barrier, but rather
   offer in some cases opportunities for adaptation planning and
   implementation. Such favourable attitudes toward adaptation do not exist
   across all small islands, so our results may be useful in determining
   the conditions under which people's perceptions are conducive to
   adaptation.},

   Florida},
Journal = {WATER POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {521-536},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Florida has been described as `ground zero' for climate change in the
   United States with coastal communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and
   water supplies under threat from saline-water intrusion, changes in
   precipitation amounts and patterns, and temperature-driven increases in
   demands. Water utilities and regional suppliers are responsible for
   their own water supply plans and adaptation strategies, which are
   developed largely by a relatively small group of technical specialists
   (internal and contracted). Water supply planning is prescribed by the
   state water governance system and local community planning processes.
   The degree of engagement of large coastal communities and water
   utilities and regional water suppliers in Florida with climate change
   research is generally high. Climate change-induced impacts to water
   supplies and demands over the common 20-year planning horizon are likely
   to be small relative to increases in demand caused by projected on-going
   population growth and normal climatic variation. Water utilities in
   Florida have been incidentally moving toward more climate-resilient
   supplies (e.g., brackish groundwater desalination) due to the
   unavailability of additional permittable, inexpensive fresh groundwater
   rather than climate change concerns. Climate change will narrow the
   alternatives for future water-supply development.},

Title = {Measuring community resilience against coastal hazards: Case study in
   Baron Beach, Gunungkidul Regency},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The impacts of natural disaster occurred in coastal area have pushed
   environmental damage and threatened its sustainability as well as the
   existence of community livelihood. Accelerating risks from coastal
   hazards add the disadvantages for communities living in coastal areas,
   especially those who are very dependent on natural resources. The
   objectives of the research are the research is intended to measure the
   resilience of coastal community through collective resilience assessment
   and bottom-up approach in community level. Based on overall scores,
   mix-livelihood community is categorized as medium resilience with the
   score of (1.99), whereas fishery community (2.3) and tourism community
   (2.5) are categorized as high resilience score. The result of the
   participatory approach suggests that communities in Baron Beach are
   highly aware of the importance of the coastal environment especially
   within karst ecosystem. however, their awareness does not in line with
   their action of managing the sustainability of the ecosystem. Their
   livelihood practices still neglect the principle of environment
   conservation. Environmental conservation efforts and long-term disaster
   mitigation practice are still behind economic fulfillment of the
   livelihood. Therelbre, community participation is a crucial requirement
   for implementing this approach. This research proposed co-management
   practice in form of Adaptive Co-Management that can be defined as a
   partnership approach where government and resource users share the
   responsibility and authority for the management of a fishery or area,
   based on collaboration between themselves and with other stakeholders.

Title = {Scenario planning to leap-frog the Sustainable Development Goals: An
   adaptation pathways approach},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {83-99},
Abstract = {Few studies have examined how to mainstream future climate change
   uncertainty into decision-making for poverty alleviation in developing
   countries. With potentially drastic climate change emerging later this
   century, there is an imperative to develop planning tools which can
   enable vulnerable rural communities to proactively build adaptive
   capacity and `leap-frog' the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using
   an example from Indonesia, we present a novel participatory approach to
   achieve this. We applied scenario planning to operationalise four
   adaptation pathways principles: (1) consideration of climate change as a
   component of multi-scale social-ecological systems; (2) recognition of
   stakeholders' competing values, goals and knowledge through co-learning;
   (3) coordination of responses across multiple decision-making levels;
   and (4) identification of strategies which are `no regrets', incremental
   (tackling proximate drivers of community vulnerability) and
   transformative (tackling systemic drivers). Workshops with stakeholders
   from different administrative levels identified drivers of change, an
   aspirational vision and explorative scenarios for livelihoods in 2090,
   and utilised normative back-casting to design no regrets adaptation
   strategies needed to achieve the vision. The resulting `tapestry' of
   strategies were predominantly incremental, and targeted conventional
   development needs. Few directly addressed current or possible future
   climate change impacts. A minority was transformative, and higher level
   stakeholders identified proportionately more transformative strategies
   than local level stakeholders. Whilst the vast majority of strategies
   were no regrets, some were potentially mal-adaptive, particularly for
   coastal areas and infrastructure. There were few examples of
   transformative innovations that could generate a step-change in linked
   human and environmental outcomes, hence leap-frogging the SDGs. We
   conclude that whilst effective at integrating future uncertainties into
   community development planning, our approach should place greater
   emphasis on analysing and addressing systemic drivers through extended
   learning cycles. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the impacts of climate change on the Small
   Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean and the Pacific, which,
   through their geography and location, are amongst the most vulnerable
   countries in the world to natural hazards and the impacts of climate
   change. It explores how, in the main, the lack of recognition of the
   economic imperatives and importance of well-managed cities and urban
   centres in the SIDS has resulted in national urban planning systems and
   internationally-funded climate change adaptation and natural risk
   resilience mitigation `best practice' interventions that largely ignore
   the needs of the urban poor living in urban centres - in particular,
   those in extra-legal settlements. It goes on to posit a different set of
   interrelated measures based on successful lessons from the field that
   might circumscribe a more targeted approach to climate change adaptation
   and to strengthening risk resilience in these small, vulnerable
   countries, so as to be more inclusive of the poor.},

Abstract = {Green infrastructure in developed countries has been used as a climate
   change adaptation strategy to lower increased temperatures in cities.
   But, the use of green infrastructure to provide ecosystem services and
   increase resilience is largely overlooked in climate change and urban
   policies in the developing world. This study analyzed the role of
   urbanization and green infrastructure on urban surface temperatures in
   Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, in sub-Saharan Africa. We use available
   geospatial data and techniques to spatially and temporally explore
   urbanization and land surface temperatures (LSTs) over 20 years. The
   effect of specific green infrastructure areas in the city on LSTs was
   also analyzed. Results show increased urbanization rates and increased
   temperature trends across time and space. But, LST in green
   infrastructure areas was indeed lower than adjacent impervious,
   urbanized areas. Seasonal phenological differences due to rainfall
   patterns, available planting space, and site limitations should be
   accounted for to maximize temperature reduction benefits. We discuss an
   approach on how study findings and urban and peri-urban agriculture and
   forestry are being used for policy uptake and formulation in the field
   of climate change, food security, and urbanization by the municipal
   government in this city in Burkina Faso.},

Abstract = {Longkou City is a coastal area, and lacks water resources. The
   overexploitation of groundwater causes seawater intrusion. At present,
   seawater intrudes an area of 68 km(2). With the decrease of groundwater
   extraction, the seawater intrusion area has generally declined. The
   paper expounds the development process of seawater intrusion as well as
   the corresponding prevention and control measures of using groundwater
   replenishment and groundwater throttling in Longkou City. In view of the
   seawater intrusion problem in Longkou City, some adaptive management
   countermeasures are put forward, which include: Adjusting industrial and
   agricultural structure, promoting economic and social development to
   match water resources; improving water usage structure, optimizing the
   utilization of water resources; advancing the construction of a
   water-saving society, using water resources efficiently; implementing
   inter-basin water transfer, using water resources rationally; developing
   and utilizing unconventional water sources, making full use of water
   resources; strengthening water infrastructure construction, increasing
   the development and utilization potential of water resources; carrying
   out ecological restoration, protecting water resources and ecological
   environment; improving the management informationalization level,
   strengthening the capabilities of groundwater monitoring and management;
   increasing publicity, improving public awareness of participation.},

Title = {Cross-sectoral and multiscalar exposure assessment to advance climate
   adaptation policy: The case of future coastal flooding of California's
   airports},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Abstract = {Climate adaptation is inevitable to managing the climate risk of
   infrastructure systems and has become an emerging topic in the past
   decade. Despite the growing need for collaborative and multi-agency
   efforts in climate change adaptation, however, current airport and
   transportation governance structures reinforce siloed approaches to
   manage climate risk. Here we combine a novel coastal flooding exposure
   assessment of California's airports and a policy review to address the
   importance of collaborative climate adaptation by viewing airport
   infrastructures as inter-connected systems across spatial scales and
   sectors. Our exposure assessment innovates by investigating the airport
   perimeter, its interconnected infrastructure (road access, ground-based
   navigation and communications systems), and multimodal interregional
   transportation corri-dors. At the local scale, we find that substantial
   airport assets are exposed as early as 2020-2040, suggesting the urgency
   for near-term adaptation actions. Regarding the interconnected
   in-frastructures, 23 unaccounted airports are identified at risk of
   disruption when compared with existing studies, including global hubs
   such as the Los Angeles International Airport. At the regional scale, we
   investigate how exposed airports transfer risk within the interregional
   multi -modal transportation corridors, and we identify the critical
   airports within these corridors to be prioritized for adaptation.
   Finally, based on a policy review of more than 100 state legislature and
   planning documents, implications of our results are discussed at the
   national and state levels. This study presents a new generation of
   infrastructure exposure assessment to climate-induced hazards, by
   addressing cross-sectoral and multiscalar dependencies that are
   currently overlooked by adaptation policies. We also argue that new
   modes of collaborative efforts are needed to achieve effective climate
   adaptation for interconnected infrastructures.},

Abstract = {The specter of a rapidly changing environment, bringing with it more
   frequent extreme weather events, changing temperatures, rising sea
   levels, and impacts we cannot entirely anticipate, suggests that current
   approaches to historic preservation will need to be adapted in order to
   continue to protect our cultural heritage with the same level of care
   that we expect today. In attempting to anticipate the needs of a
   constantly changing future, preservationists need to plan for a range of
   eventualities, consider new strategies, and determine how these
   strategies can be tested. Interestingly, appropriate adaptive strategies
   may exist in past cultural responses to harsh and shifting environments,
   like our coastal areas and barrier islands. One such historic coastal
   community, which represents the unique type of heritage and sense of
   place that preservationists work to protect and is currently at risk due
   to sea level rise, is Portsmouth Village on the Outer Banks of North
   Carolina. The particular responses and adaptations to a challenging and
   ever-changing environment, which were developed and adopted by residents
   of Portsmouth Village to address environmental forces, offer some clues
   for possible future responses to climate change. This paper examines
   historical approaches and potential future strategies for the
   preservation of cultural landscapes and other heritage resources
   threatened by climate change.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARITIME ARCHAEOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tropical cyclones are among the most detrimental hazards to the
   environment, societies, and economies, each year affecting millions of
   people and resulting in substantial casualties and material destructions
   in coastal communities. In this context, maritime cultural heritage,
   encompassing material evidence for the engagement of people with the
   sea, both on land and under water, is particularly vulnerable. Despite
   the significant number of archaeological sites exposed to tropical
   cyclones and other extreme sea-level events, maritime cultural heritage
   in the MENA region is rarely included in coastal vulnerability indices
   or incorporated in mitigation strategies, disaster management,
   sustainability, and resilience policies. In this study we examine the
   impact of tropical cyclones on the maritime archaeology of Oman with
   emphasis on the Dhofar region. This paper builds on existing coastal
   research in the Dhofar region-an area identified as the most
   cyclone-prone administrative region in Oman, but also an area that
   contains substantial archaeological remains. Central among Dhofar's
   maritime cultural heritage is Al-Baleed, a Medieval seaport with
   unparalleled evidence of engagement with international trade networks.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the results of two research programs undertaken in France, we
   consider environmental inequality and regional solidarity in the context
   of adaptation to sea-level rise, given that there is in France a bespoke
   national system for natural-disaster solidarity. The analysis makes it
   possible to address situations of inequality, in particular related to
   risk, and regional institutional capacities as well as the types of
   solidarity (at spatial and temporal scales), by studying their impact on
   motivation and adaptation practices in terms of incentives or behavioral
   inertia. It also highlights seven interactions and discusses their
   effects. It emerges that insurance-based solidarity favors the status
   quo: by compensating or protecting, through dykes construction, the
   populations whose property is exposed to coastal hazards, this strategy
   maintains the environmental inequalities present on the coasts; the
   least well-off social groups participate in this financing without
   benefiting from better access to the coast (land or recreational
   activities). It also appears that the recent taxation system for funding
   the cost of palliative measures reinforces inequalities between coastal
   municipalities and hinterland municipalities and that differentiated
   forms of solidarity between the risk of erosion (uncompensated victims)
   and inundation (compensated victims) generate inequalities. Finally, it
   is noteworthy that inequalities reduce social, and strengthen
   intragroup, cohesion. The analysis of these relations reveals their
   somewhat negative effect on regional adaptation strategies to sea-level
   rise and calls into question the scales and modalities of solidarity
   whilst highlighting the key role of social cohesion as a factor of
   acceptability of regional restructuring programs in the face of
   sea-level rise.},

Abstract = {Our oceans comprise valuable assets that provide a range of social and
   economic benefits directly and indirectly through provisioning,
   regulating, cultural and supporting services. Fisheries rely on these
   services and are regionally important industries for many coastal
   communities. With a growing population and increasing demand for seafood
   production, impacts from climate change that alter the productivity of
   marine ecosystems will have flow-on implications for economic and social
   systems. As small coastal communities are often highly dependent on
   marine-based activities they are also expected to experience greater
   impacts from changes in productivity of marine resources than their
   larger and/or non-coastal counterparts. To assist coastal communities in
   evaluating their vulnerability to climate change we have developed a
   hybrid socio-ecological vulnerability index that combines an ecocentric
   index - i.e., an ecological vulnerability index - with a sociocentric
   index that focuses on adaptive capacity as a measure of vulnerability,
   and embeds a sustainable livelihoods approach. Through the use of an
   on-line tool, coastal communities can improve their understanding of
   their vulnerability to more appropriately adapt, embrace opportunities
   and minimize negative impacts that may arise from climate change and its
   effect on marine resource availability.},

Abstract = {The Regional Planning Association Western Pomerania conducts the
   research project `Spatial Development Strategy for Climate Change in the
   Planning Region Western Pomerania'. This project is part of the action
   program `Demonstration Projects of Spatial Planning' (MORO) of the
   German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs. The
   Strategy aims at a combination of adaptation measures and measures for
   climate protection, which can be effectively communicated to the public.
   Five fields of action that are geared towards the most important spatial
   factors and that are discussed by experts and other stakeholders ensure
   an integrated Adaptation Strategy. The fields of action `biodiversity',
   `agriculture, forestry and fishery', `water management and water cycle',
   and `settlement and urban development, mobility, tourism, power
   generation and energy distribution' build on one another and show a
   number of interactions. The fifth field of action addresses the regional
   measures for climate adaptation. Upon project completion in 2011, a
   coherent Strategy for regional development will be presented. The
   Strategy will also address the parameters precipitation and temperature
   and the indicator rise in sea level, which are influenced by Climate
   Change. The Strategy contains the planning direction in terms of
   protection of regional biodiversity, adaptation of agriculture and
   forestry, protection of ground- and drinking water, settlement and urban
   development and tourism as well as new mobility and power generation
   concepts. Measures for climate protection that offer development
   opportunities for local authorities, industry and private enterprise
   receive a supporting regional context. The Spatial Development Strategy
   will be politically binding by way of the resolutions of the Regional
   Planning Association Western Pomerania and will direct regional planning
   in the coming years.},

Title = {CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTING RICE PRODUCTION: THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND

Year = {2009},

Pages = {59-122},
Abstract = {This review addresses possible adaptation strategies in rice production
   to abiotic stresses that will aggravate under climate change: heat (high
   temperature and humidity), drought, salinity, and submergence. Each
   stress is discussed regarding the current state of knowledge on damage
   mechanism for rice plants as well as possible developments in germplasm
   and crop management technologies to overcome production losses. Higher
   temperatures can adversely affect rice yields through two principal
   pathways, namely (i) high maximum temperatures that cause-in combination
   with high humidity -spikelet sterility and adversely affect grain
   quality and (ii) increased nighttime temperatures that may reduce
   assimilate accumulation. On the other hand, some rice cultivars are
   grown in extremely hot environments, so that the development of rice
   germplasm with improved heat resistance can capture an enormous genetic
   pool for this trait. Likewise, drought is a common phenomenon in many
   rice growing environments, and agriculture research has achieved
   considerable progress in terms of germplasm improvement and crop
   management (i.e., water saving techniques) to cope with the complexity
   of the drought syndrome. Rice is highly sensitive to salinity. Salinity
   often coincides with other stresses in rice production, namely drought
   in inland areas or submergence in coastal areas. Submergence tolerance
   of rice plants has substantially been improved by introgressing the Sub1
   gene into popular rice cultivars in many Asian rice growing areas.
   Finally, the review comprises a comparative assessment of the rice
   versus other crops related to climate change. The rice crop has many
   unique features in terms of susceptibility and adaptation to climate
   change impacts due to its semiaquatic phylogenetic origin. The bulk of
   global rice supply originates from irrigated systems which are to some
   extent shielded from immediate drought effects. The buffer effect of
   irrigation against climate change impacts, however, will depend on
   nature and state of the respective irrigation system. The envisaged
   propagation of irrigation water saving techniques will entail benefits
   for the resilience of rice production systems to future droughts. We
   conclude that there are considerable risks for rice production stemming
   from climate change, but that the development of necessary adaptation
   options can capitalize on an enormous variety of rice production systems
   in very different climates and on encouraging progress in recent
   research.},

Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},

Volume = {79},
Number = {2},
Pages = {532-539},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {At first glance, large-scale fisheries may seem adaptable to climate
   change. Adaptation takes place from the governance to the individual
   level of fishers. At the individual level, skippers make day-to-day
   decisions on where to fish and are at the forefront of the response to
   changes at sea. We seek to understand such individual adaptation in
   large-scale fisheries, using the case of the Spanish tropical tuna
   fishery. We surveyed 22\% of Spanish freezer purse seine skippers
   operating in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. In the last 10
   years, more than half of skippers used new technology to search for
   tunas and expanded their fishing area as adaptation actions. Using
   cluster analysis, we identified two skipper groups-based on stated
   behaviours to confront different hypothetical scenarios of catch
   decline-that would follow adaptation or transformation strategies. The
   majority of skippers would follow adaptation strategies until a
   hypothetical 30\% catch decrease and then choices diverge. Skipper
   characteristics, such as importance given to intergenerational
   knowledge, perceptions of change in tropical tuna abundance, and years
   working in the current job, can explain the adaptation and
   transformation choices. These findings help understand the potential for
   adaptation behaviour by skippers involved in fisheries confronting catch
   declines.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Globally, the consequences of climate change have rapidly necessitated
   local government action to mitigate and adapt to rising sea levels,
   increased storm frequency, and higher temperatures. Acknowledgement of
   underlying climate issues, however, varies widely across regions and
   towns. Using critical discourse analysis (CDA), this paper evaluates the
   climate change acknowledgment of five municipality sustainability action
   plans (SAP) in coastal Florida and the broader implications for
   sustainable development. Public pressure, environmental champions, and
   recent storm events causing infrastructure damage were identified as key
   factors underpinning coastal climate change acknowledgement. Notably,
   the plans that admitted the anthropogenic causes of climate change were
   more optimistic and action focused. By emphasizing local mitigation
   efforts and opportunities, they were more empowering than those that
   treated climate threats as inevitable external circumstances.
   Anthropogenic climate change acknowledgment is thus a powerful tool for
   local governments to catalyze action when developing their
   sustainability goals and plans.},

Title = {Setting expected timelines of fished population recovery for the
   adaptive management of a marine protected area network},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},

Abstract = {Adaptive management of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires developing
   methods to evaluate whether monitoring data indicate that they are
   performing as expected. Modeling the expected responses of targeted
   species to an MPA network, with a clear timeline for those expectations,
   can aid in the development of a monitoring program that efficiently
   evaluates expectations over appropriate time frames. Here, we describe
   the expected trajectories in abundance and biomass following MPA
   implementation for populations of 19 nearshore fishery species in
   California. To capture the process of filling in the age structure
   truncated by fishing, we used age-structured population models with
   stochastic larval recruitment to predict responses to MPA
   implementation. We implemented both demographically open (high larval
   immigration) and closed (high self-recruitment) populations to model the
   range of possible trajectories as they depend on recruitment dynamics.
   From these simulations, we quantified the time scales over which
   anticipated increases in abundance and biomass inside MPAs would become
   statistically detectable. Predicted population biomass responses range
   from little change, for species with low fishing rates, to increasing by
   a factor of nearly seven, for species with high fishing rates before MPA
   establishment. Increases in biomass following MPA implementation are
   usually greater in both magnitude and statistical detectability than
   increases in abundance. For most species, increases in abundance would
   not begin to become detectable for at least 10 years after
   implementation. Overall, these results inform potential indicator
   metrics (biomass), potential indicator species (those with a high
   fishing : natural mortality ratio), and time frame (>10 yr) for MPA
   monitoring assessment as part of the adaptive management process.},

Abstract = {In many places in the world the effects of common floods are increased
   by climate change. In the area around the Indonesian city of Semarang,
   the number and effects of tidal flooding are becoming more and more
   severe. We found that the inhabitants used different strategies against
   the impact of flooding. In both the existing and the predicted flood
   prone areas, most people appear not to intend to leave the area, even
   when the floods become everyday routine. People are connected to their
   dwellings in a way that abandoning is not a realistic scenario. This
   study provides relevant information about the way people in the affected
   areas perceive flood risks and adaptation opportunities. Governmental
   policy-makers and urban planners could base their strategies and actions
   on this information.},

Title = {Developed barrier island adaptation strategies to hurricane forcing
   under rising sea levels},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {143},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {173-184},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Global sea levels have risen at a rate of 1.7 mm/year over the last
   century and are projected to rise an additional 0.2 to 2.0 m by 2100
   with some regions experiencing higher rise in relative sea level due to
   localized processes. As sea levels rise, low-lying, narrow barrier
   islands are threatened by episodic flooding and wave impact and are
   particularly vulnerable during storm events. These types of islands are
   ubiquitous along the U.S. East and South coasts and other coasts
   worldwide. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of several
   adaptation strategies, including combinations of nature-based and hard
   structures, on developed barrier islands to hurricane forcing under
   future sea levels. Interpreting the results of a morphological numerical
   model, beach nourishment from the toe of the dune to the depth of
   closure (i.e., active beach only) provides only a slight increase in
   protection for the island from hurricane forcing as sea levels rise.
   Raising elevations of the existing dune or existing buried seawall
   effectively reduces overall volumetric erosion but, under extreme sea
   level rise, does not protect against bay-side flooding and severe
   back-barrier erosion. Raising the elevation of the entire island,
   particularly the back-barrier region, offered the greatest protection
   from severe erosion on the developed barrier island under future sea
   level states and hurricane forcing. Using these results, an adaptation
   pathway based on level of sea level rise is created to illustrate the
   effectiveness of an adaptive approach in managing the accelerating risk
   posed by sea level rise.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a fact; therefore, adaptation to a changing
   environment is a necessity. Adaptation is ultimately local, yet similar
   challenges pose themselves to decision-makers all across the globe and
   on all levels. The Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology has
   established an economic framework to fully integrate risk and reward
   perspectives of different stakeholders, underpinned by the CLIMADA
   (CLIMateADAptation) impact modeling platform. We present an extension of
   the latter to appraise adaption options in a consistent fashion in order
   to provide decision-makers from the local to the global level with the
   necessary facts to identify the most effective instruments to meet the
   adaptation challenge. We apply the open-source Python implementation to
   a tropical cyclone impact case study in the Caribbean, using openly
   available data. This allows us to prioritize a small basket of
   adaptation options, namely green and gray infrastructure options as well
   as behavioral measures and risk transfer, and permits inter-island
   comparisons. In Anguilla, for example, mangroves avert simulated damages
   more than 4 times the cost estimated for mangrove restoration, whereas
   the enforcement of building codes is shown to be effective in the Turks
   and Caicos Islands in a moderate-climate-change scenario. For all
   islands, cost-effective measures reduce the cost of risk transfer, which
   covers the damage of high-impact events that cannot be cost-effectively
   prevented by other measures. This extended version of the CLIMADA
   platform has been designed to enable risk assessment and options
   appraisal in a modular form and occasionally bespoke fashion yet with
   the high reusability of common functionalities to foster the usage of
   the platform in interdisciplinary studies and international
   collaboration.},

Abstract = {One of the most critical impacts of sea level rise is that flooding
   suffered by ever larger settlements in tropical deltas will increase.
   Here we look at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and quantify the threats that
   coastal floods pose to safety and to the economy. For this, we produce
   flood maps through hydrodynamic modeling and, by combining these with
   data sets of exposure and vulnerability, we estimate two indicators of
   risk: the damage to assets and the number of potential casualties. We
   simulate current and future (2050 and 2100) flood risk using IPCC
   scenarios of sea level rise and socioeconomic change. We find that
   annual damage may grow by more than 1 order of magnitude, and potential
   casualties may grow 5-20-fold until the end of the century, in the
   absence of adaptation. Impacts depend strongly on the climate and
   socioeconomic scenarios considered. Next, we simulate the implementation
   of adaptation measures and calculate their effectiveness in reducing
   impacts. We find that a ring dike would protect the inner city but
   increase risk in more rural districts, whereas elevating areas at risk
   and dryproofing buildings will reduce impacts to the city as a whole.
   Most measures perform well from an economic standpoint. Combinations of
   measures seem to be the optimal solution and may address potential
   equity conflicts. Based on our results, we design possible adaptation
   pathways for Ho Chi Minh City for the coming decades; these can inform
   policy-making and strategic thinking.
   Plain Language Summary While sea levels gradually rise, concerns about
   coastal floods become higher, especially in low-lying cities in the
   tropics. In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, floods are already large and
   frequent. Here we look at how coastal floods, and their impacts, will
   evolve on this city during the coming decades. Using different scenarios
   of sea level rise and socioeconomic growth, we calculate that risk, in
   terms of urban damage and potential casualties, may increase even more
   than 10-fold, if adaptation measures are not taken. We then simulate the
   realization of different adaptation measures: a ring dike, elevating
   part of the city, retrofitting buildings, and changing land use, and
   their combination. Most measures have the potential of reducing a
   considerable part of flood risk. The ring dike has the disadvantage that
   it would protect the inner city while increasing risk in outer
   districts; if implemented, it should therefore be combined with other
   measures. Also, the economic performance of most measures seems highly
   positive, suggesting that adaptation will generate high returns on
   investment. We conclude our analysis by generating possible adaptation
   pathways, to inform decisions on the type and timing of adaptation in Ho
   Chi Minh City.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Green-blue infrastructures in urban spaces offer several co-benefits
   besides flood risk reduction, such as water savings, energy savings due
   to less cooling usage, air quality improvement and carbon sequestration.
   Traditionally, these co-benefits were not included in decision making
   processes for flood risk management. In this work we present a method to
   include the monetary analysis of these co-benefits into a cost-benefits
   analysis of flood risk mitigation measures. This approach was applied to
   a case study, comparing costs and benefits with and without co-benefits.
   Different intervention strategies were considered, using green, blue and
   grey measures and combinations of them. The results obtained illustrate
   the importance of assessing co-benefits when identifying best adaptation
   strategies to improve urban flood risk management. Otherwise green
   infrastructure is likely to appear less efficient than more conventional
   grey infrastructure. Moreover, a mix of green, blue and grey
   infrastructures is likely to result in the best adaptation strategy as
   these three alternatives tend to complement each other. Grey
   infrastructure has good performance at reducing the risk of flooding,
   whilst green infrastructure brings in multiple additional benefits that
   grey infrastructure cannot offer.},

Title = {Shark management strategy policy considerations: Community preferences,
   reasoning and speculations},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {111-119},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Shark management is contested and community support often influences
   policy. Decision makers are unlikely to be comfortable explaining policy
   solely based on expert advice, scientific data, or any information, if
   they feel out of touch with important stakeholder thinking. This study
   explored community attitudes to shark management and also reasons for
   preferences. It used Appraisal to analyse comments related to the NSW
   Shark Management Strategy in Twitter and public Facebook sites over one
   year, and focus groups with beach and ocean end-users. Most harm
   mitigation and research strategies were supported, with drones and
   Clever Buoys the preferred concepts. Mesh nets were widely criticised.
   The most common reasons given for strategy preferences emphasised the
   likelihood of harm to sharks and other marine species, cost efficiency,
   and likelihood that a strategy would generate fear or reassurance.
   Findings emphasised hope that detection, deterrent and surveillance
   technologies will improve efficacy of shark harm mitigation in the
   future. Importantly for policy makers, the findings elaborate simple
   preference information, revealing multidimensionality in attitudes
   concerning shark harm mitigation strategies, and explaining associations
   and thinking. The study highlights the importance of listening to
   communities and carefully planning and adapting policy communication.},

Title = {An interactive simulation and visualization tool for flood analysis

Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {307-324},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Developing strategies to mitigate or to adapt to the threats of floods
   is an important topic in the context of climate changes. Many of the
   world's cities are endangered due to rising ocean levels and changing
   precipitation patterns. It is therefore crucial to develop analytical
   tools that allow us to evaluate the threats of floods and to investigate
   the influence of mitigation and adaptation measures, such as stronger
   dikes, adaptive spatial planning, and flood disaster plans. Up until the
   present, analytical tools have only been accessible to domain experts,
   as the involved simulation processes are complex and rely on
   computational and data-intensive models. Outputs of these analytical
   tools are presented to practitioners (i.e., policy analysts and
   political decision-makers) on maps or in graphical user interfaces. In
   practice, this output is only used in limited measure because
   practitioners often have different information requirements or do not
   trust the direct outcome. Nonetheless, literature indicates that a
   closer collaboration between domain experts and practitioners can ensure
   that the information requirements of practitioners are better aligned
   with the opportunities and limitations of analytical tools. The
   objective of our work is to present a step forward in the effort to make
   analytical tools in flood management accessible for practitioners to
   support this collaboration between domain experts and practitioners. Our
   system allows the user to interactively control the simulation process
   (addition of water sources or influence of rainfall), while a realistic
   visualization allows the user to mentally map the results onto the real
   world. We have developed several novel algorithms to present and
   interact with flood data. We explain the technologies, discuss their
   necessity alongside test cases, and introduce a user study to analyze
   the reactions of practitioners to our system. We conclude that, despite
   the complexity of flood simulation models and the size of the involved
   data sets, our system is accessible for practitioners of flood
   management so that they can carry out flood simulations together with
   domain experts in interactive work sessions. Therefore, this work has
   the potential to significantly change the decision-making process and
   may become an important asset in choosing sustainable flood mitigations
   and adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Recent global climate changes have increased the frequency of disasters.
   Therefore, land-use plans should immediately account for climate change
   impacts, which can help to reduce the risks and damage associated with
   development under extreme climate events. This study used secondary data
   analysis, literature review, focus group discussions and key informant
   interviews to explore climate change issues and strategies for two
   townships along the coastal areas of Chiayi County, Taiwan. Accordingly,
   this study follows the guidelines from Taiwan's Adaptation Strategy to
   Climate Change to work out sustainable adaptation plans for the coastal
   areas. Basic principles are proposed for disaster prevention and
   mitigation, adaptation, and transformation. In accordance with these
   principles, strategies are suggested for five areas: managing water
   resources, restoring the ecological habitat, constructing
   community-based green energy storage systems, ensuring safety and
   reforming the landscape. The last section concludes the study.},

Abstract = {This study examines the factors motivating local jurisdictions in the
   United States (U.S.) to voluntarily adopt policies that mitigate the
   anthropogenic sources of climate change when there are powerful
   political and economic incentives to do otherwise. Specifically, we
   explain adoption of the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) program at
   the county level with indicators of climate change risk, climate stress,
   and opportunity for climate policy action. Statistical and spatial
   results indicate that counties with high risk, low stress, and high
   opportunity characteristics associated with climate change are
   significantly more likely to join the CCP campaign. Results also show
   that the odds of a locality joining the CCP are predictable by the
   landscape characteristics of spatial neighbors. Identifying a profile
   for likely adoption of climate change mitigation strategies can help
   decision makers effectively target local jurisdictions for recruitment
   into the CCP and similar programs in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   Governing the ecosystems as a commons},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The paradigm shift to holistic management rests on the insight that
   exploitation affects all aspects of the ecosystem. While scholars and
   policy-makers all want ecosystem based management (EBM), few, if any,
   have achieved it in practice. Adaptive governance promises effective
   EBM, but guidance remains elusive. Looking back to an ecosystem people
   such as the indigenous Maori in the south of New Zealand and analyzing
   their resource management system using Ostrom's (1990) eight-principle
   framework for common property rights regimes allows us to answer three
   central questions. How did Ngai Tahu, the dominant tribe on the South
   Island, manage the complex linkages, uncertainty and interactions with
   nature while exploiting their environment? Was resource exploitation
   sustainable? And what can be drawn from their management system for
   modern governance structures? The application of Ostrom's framework
   shows that kaitiakitanga (stewardship) as an integrated management
   system generally aligns with the principles necessary for successful EBM
   and provided Ngai Tahu with the necessary tools to control and adapt
   measures across space and time, mirroring the modern tenets of adaptive
   management. Studying a people that practiced EBM successfully provides
   the insight that EBM may be achieved by governing ecosystems through an
   integrated common property management system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   results indicate that the adaptation produced through the planning
   system remains incremental rather than transformative. It is focused on
   experienced hazards, especially flooding, and there is a lack of
   attention being paid to wider impacts of climate change, such as rising
   average temperatures. Furthermore, it was found that the contemporary
   contribution of planning to climate change adaptation is seriously
   limited by the government's emphasis on housing and economic growth and
   by the development industry's emphasis on economic viability.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses a key threat to marine ecosystems and fisheries
   resources as well as to communities that depend on these systems for
   food and livelihoods. This paper reports on a community-based rapid
   vulnerability assessment (RVA) methodology developed and applied in
   eight small-scale fishing communities in the Benguela Current Large
   Marine Ecosystem region. This participatory methodology was designed to
   be applied in a workshop setting and draws on the observations,
   perceptions and local knowledge of fishers in order to better understand
   the extent to which their livelihoods are susceptible to various
   socio-ecological changes and their ability to respond to these changes.
   The paper highlights selected key findings and aims to demonstrate the
   type of information that can be elicited from an RVA. Although there
   were differences between the three countries involved in the study,
   findings suggest that key stressors are mainly associated with
   socio-economic and governance issues. Climate-related changes were seen
   to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Despite differences in spatial
   and temporal scales of data provided by scientists and fishers, changes
   in environmental conditions that could be attributed to climate change
   observed by fishers resonated with available science. Fishers identified
   a number of adaptation strategies that could address vulnerabilities and
   enhance resilience but require support from government and other
   stakeholders. Strengthening local organizations, rebuilding fisheries
   through local co-management plans, securing access rights, involving
   fishers in data collection and analysis, developing complementary
   livelihoods and addressing the broad socio-economic rights of
   communities were identified as necessary to address vulnerabilities.
   Participation in these community-level vulnerability assessments
   enhances understanding, builds capacity, generates knowledge for
   management, and allows communities to identify locally appropriate
   adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {The paper reports on a comparative study of three different cases on
   vision and strategy development for climate change adaptation planning
   in (i) The South African Breede-Overberg Catchment, (ii) The Mississippi
   Estuary-New Orleans region and (iii) The Dutch Rhine-Meuse Estuary. The
   objective of the paper is twofold: to develop a better understanding of
   such processes and to further develop the Backcasting-Adaptive
   Management (BCAM) methodology. A framework for case evaluation is
   developed using six dimensions: (i) inputs and resources, (ii) future
   vision, (iii) stakeholder engagement, (iv) methodological aspects, (v)
   pathway development and (vi) impact. Major conclusions based on a
   cross-case comparison and testing propositions are (i) participatory
   vision development is a strong tool for climate change adaptation
   planning in different governance contexts and shows considerable
   diversity in its application in these contexts; (ii) a single, shared
   future vision is not a prerequisite for vision and pathway development
   and endorsement; (iii) broad stakeholder engagement enriches strategy
   development, but the involvement of marginal groups requires additional
   efforts and capacity building; (iv) multiple pathways and robust
   elements are useful but require novel expertise; and (v) more
   institutional embeddedness and support for participatory processes lead
   to better implementation of the outcomes of these processes.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to have profound effects on
   species distributions over the coming decades. In this paper, we used
   maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to estimate the effects of projected
   changes in climate on extent of climatically-suitable habitat for two
   Nepenthes pitcher plant species in Borneo. The model results predicted
   an increase in area of climatically-suitable habitat for the lowland
   species Nepenthes rafflesiana by 2100; in contrast, the highland species
   Nepenthes tentaculata was predicted to undergo significant loss of
   climatically-suitable habitat over the same period. Based on the results
   of the models, we recommend that research be undertaken into practical
   mitigation strategies, as approximately two-thirds of Nepenthes are
   restricted to montane habitats. Highland species with narrow elevational
   ranges will be at particularly high risk, and investigation into
   possible mitigation strategies should be focused on them.},

Abstract = {Urban morphology plays a crucial role in the alteration of the local
   climate, resulting in the formation of Urban Heat Islands. Regarding the
   steady growth of cities and the impact of global climate change, the
   risk of overheating is expected to increase. In order to reduce this
   risk and the resulting health problems, planning measures are needed to
   adapt to these severe events. Planners however need tools to quantify
   and evaluate different adaption strategies to judge its effectiveness.
   This paper presents conceptual thoughts towards the development of such
   a planning tool, as well as proposing a method to derive potential areas
   of intra Urban Heat Islands. A first calibration of the landscape metric
   for city of Hamburg region is presented, which showcases the method.},

Title = {Tracking changing water budgets across the Bahamian archipelago},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {598},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Freshwater resources on small island nations are already at risk from
   sea level rise and groundwater pumping however, increasing aridity due
   to climate change further stresses water availability. The amount of
   freshwater availability on small island nations is delicately balanced
   by incoming precipitation (P) and outgoing evapotranspiration (ET). As
   climate changes, some island nations may see increasing aridity (ET > P)
   which can have implications for long term freshwater sustainability.
   Understanding how P and ET are changing allows small island nations to
   make more informed planning decisions regarding sustainable management
   and to adapt contemporary strategies to accommodate future change. The
   Bahamas is one such nation made up of over 700 small islands, many of
   which rely on freshwater lenses for potable water and irrigation. We use
   precipitation obtained from the TerraClimate reanalysis dataset and
   satellite derived actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to analyze how
   seasonal and yearly water budgets have changed over the last 16 years.
   We show that ETa is increasing across the Bahamas at a higher rate than
   global averages. The cause of ETa increases is driven by both increases
   in temperature and water availability form shifting precipitation
   patterns, ultimately driving decreases in the amount of available water
   to recharge the freshwater lens.},

Title = {The Canadian Federation of Earth Sciences Scientific Statement on
   Climate Change - Its Impacts In Canada, and the Critical Role of Earth
   Scientists in Mitigation and Adaptation},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCE CANADA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {59-72},
Abstract = {The Canadian Federation of Earth Sciences (CFES) has issued this
   statement to summarize the science, effects, and implications of climate
   change. We highlight the role of Earth scientists in documenting and
   mitigating climate change, and in managing and adapting to its
   consequences in Canada. CFES is the coordinated voice of Canada's Earth
   Sciences community with 14 member organizations representing some 15,000
   geoscientists. Our members are drawn from academia, industry, education,
   and government. The mission of CFES is to ensure decision makers and the
   public understand the contributions of Earth Science to Canadian society
   and the economy.
   Climate change has become a national and global priority for all levels
   of government. The geological record shows us that the global climate
   has changed throughout. Earth's history, but the current rates of change
   are almost unprecedented. Over the last 70 years, levels of common
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere have steadily increased.
   Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is now 418 parts per million - its
   highest of the last three million years. The chemical (isotopic)
   composition of carbon in the atmosphere indicates the increase in GHGs
   is due to burning fossil fuels. GHGs absorb energy emitted from Earth's
   surface and re-radiate it back, warming the lower levels of the
   atmosphere. Climatic adjustments that have recently occurred are, in
   practical terms, irreversible, but further change can be mitigated by
   lowering emissions of GHGs.
   Climate change is amplified by three important Earth system processes
   and effects. First, as the climate warms evaporation increases, raising
   atmospheric concentrations of water vapour, itself a GHG - and adding to
   warming. Second, loss of ice cover from the polar ice sheets and
   glaciers exposes larger areas of land and open water - leading to
   greater absorption of heat from the sun. Third, thawing of near-surface
   permafrost releases additional GHGs (primarily CO2 and methane) during
   decay of organic matter previously preserved frozen in the ground. Some
   impacts of climate change are incremental and steadily occurring, such
   as melting of glaciers and ice sheets, with consequent sea level rise.
   Others are intermittent, such as extreme weather events, like hurricanes
   - but are becoming more frequent. Summer water shortages are
   increasingly common in western Canada as mountain snowpacks melt earlier
   and summer river flows decline. In northern Canada, warming and thawing
   of near-surface permafrost has led to deterioration of infrastructure
   and increased costs for buildings that now require chilled foundations.
   Other consequences of unchecked climate change include increased coastal
   erosion, increases in the number and size of wildfires, and reduction in
   winter road access to isolated northern communities. Reductions in net
   GHG emissions are urgently required to mitigate the many effects of
   further climate change. Industrial and public works development projects
   must now assess the effects of climate change in their planning, design,
   and management. Cities, municipalities, and rural communities need to
   plan new residential development carefully to avoid enhanced risk of
   flooding, coastal erosion, or wildfire.
   Earth Science knowledge and expertise is integral to exploration and
   development of new metals and Earth materials required for a
   carbon-neutral future, and in the capture and storage of CO2 within the
   Earth. Earth Science is also central to society's adaptation to new
   climatic regimes and reduction of risks. This includes anticipation,
   assessment, and management of extreme events, development of new
   standards and guidelines for geotechnical and engineering practice, and
   revision to regulations that consider climate change. Geoscientists also
   have an important role in the education of students and the public on
   the reasons for necessary action. Canada is uniquely positioned with its
   strong global geoscientific leadership, its vast landmass, and its
   northern terrain to effectively leverage research activities around
   climate change. Geoscience tools and geoscientists' skills will be
   integral to Canada's preparation for climate change.},

Title = {Effects of Climate Change and Flow Regulation on the Flow
   Characteristics of a Low-Relief River within Southern Boreal Climate
   Area},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We investigated how hydro-climatological changes would affect fluvial
   forces and inundated area during a typical high-flow situation (MHQ,
   mean high discharge), and how adaptive regulation could attenuate the
   climate change impacts in a low-relief river of the Southern Boreal
   climate area. We used hydrologically modeled data as input for 2D
   hydraulic modeling. Our results show that, even though the MHQ will
   increase in the future (2050-2079), the erosional power of the flow will
   decrease on the study area. This can be attributed to the change of
   timing in floods from spring to autumn and winter, when the sea levels
   during flood peaks is higher, causing backwater effect. Even though the
   mean depth will not increase notably (from 1.14 m to 1.25 m) during MHQ,
   compared to the control period (1985-2014), the inundated area will
   expand by 15\% due to the flat terrain. The increase in flooding may be
   restrained by adaptive regulations: strategies favoring ecologically
   sustainable and recreationally desirable lake water levels were modeled.
   The demands of environment, society, and hydropower are not necessarily
   contradictory in terms of climate change adaptation, and regulation
   could provide an adaptive practice in the areas of increased flooding.},

   adopted in 2001 a master plan: Integrated Coastal Defence Management in
   Schleswig-Holstein. It contains the strategy and the financial concept
   for coastal defence in the coming decades. After a general overview of
   the coastal zones, this paper describes the coastal defence strategy in
   Schleswig-Holstein. Special consideration will be given to the climate
   change adaptation components in the master plan. The paper ends with an
   outlook towards the implementation of the EU Flood Directive.},

Title = {A Critical Analysis of the Challenges of Collaborative Governance in
   Climate Change Adaptation Policies in Bandar Lampung City, Indonesia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is not uncommon that collaborative governance is now generating new
   attention in Indonesia as a method of governing. This is because of the
   terrible historical experience of governance during the New Order era,
   including the state's dominant role, the government's unwillingness to
   engage actors outside the state, and a centralized and top-down
   development pattern. Collaborative governance, specifically the
   recommendation to involve multiple stakeholders (government, private
   sector, and society) in government management and public policy,
   addresses these issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
   provide a critical review of the ongoing collaborative governance
   process and to determine whether various challenges associated with
   collaborative governance are influencing the success of climate change
   adaptation policies in increasing adaptive capacity in Bandar Lampung
   City. This study was conducted in Bandar Lampung City on the Indonesian
   island of Sumatra using a qualitative approach and involved informants
   who were both apparatus and members of the Bandar Lampung City Climate
   Change Resilience Coordination Team. Interviews and document analysis
   were used to collect data, which were then analyzed using a content
   analysis procedure. The findings indicate that this city has achieved a
   number of milestones in its efforts to improve the adaptive capacity of
   government institutions and society. However, the collaborative
   governance approach, which is hailed as the optimal method for
   implementing long-term public policies, is not always smooth,
   demonstrating that collaborative governance remains vulnerable to
   failure due to cultural, institutional, and political factors. The
   article concludes with suggestions for future research.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Coastal areas are vital economic hubs in terms of settlement, industry,
   agriculture, trade and tourism to mention some key sectors. There are
   already many coastal problems including erosion, flood risk and
   long-term habitat deterioration. As economies continue to develop the
   asset base at risk will grow, while accelerating climate change will
   increase the likelihood of damaging extreme events, as well as
   accelerate habitat decline. Existing coastal management and defence
   approaches are not well tuned to these challenges as they assume a
   static situation.
   THESEUS project is developing a systematic approach to delivering both a
   low-risk coast for human use and healthy habitats for evolving coastal
   zones subject to multiple change factors. The project examines
   innovative mitigation and adaptation technologies and integrate the best
   of these technical measures in a strategic policy context through
   over-arching guidelines. THESEUS activities are carried out within a
   multidisciplinary framework using 8 study sites across Europe, with
   specific attention to the most vulnerable coastal environments such as
   deltas, estuaries and wetlands, where many large cities and industrial
   areas are located.
   This paper describes THESEUS approach, and specifically: the
   Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consquence model for coastal risk assessment;
   the engineering, social, economic and ecological mitigation measures
   under analysis; the participatory approach with end users and coastal
   authorities for the selection and identification of the appropriate
   defence strategy to be planned in sudy sites. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A Comprehensive Review on Membrane Fouling: Mathematical Modelling,
   Prediction, Diagnosis, and Mitigation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Membrane-based separation has gained increased popularity over the past
   few decades, particularly reverse osmosis (RO). A major impediment to
   the improved performance of membrane separation processes, in general,
   is membrane fouling. Fouling has detrimental effects on the membrane's
   performance and integrity, as the deposition and accumulation of
   foulants on its surface and/or within its pores leads to a decline in
   the permeate flux, deterioration of selectivity, and permeability, as
   well as a significantly reduced lifespan. Several factors influence the
   fouling-propensity of a membrane, such as surface morphology, roughness,
   hydrophobicity, and material of fabrication. Generally, fouling can be
   categorized into particulate, organic, inorganic, and biofouling.
   Efficient prediction techniques and diagnostics are integral for
   strategizing control, management, and mitigation interventions to
   minimize the damage of fouling occurrences in the membranes. To improve
   the antifouling characteristics of RO membranes, surface enhancements by
   different chemical and physical means have been extensively sought
   after. Moreover, research efforts have been directed towards
   synthesizing membranes using novel materials that would improve their
   antifouling performance. This paper presents a review of the different
   membrane fouling types, fouling-inducing factors, predictive methods,
   diagnostic techniques, and mitigation strategies, with a special focus
   on RO membrane fouling.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change and mitigation of climate change are policy
   substitutes, as both reduce the impacts of climate change. Adaptation
   and mitigation should therefore be analysed together, as they indeed

   abatement. However, adaptation and mitigation are done by different
   people operating at different spatial and temporal scales. This hampers
   analysis of the trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. An
   exception is facilitative adaptation (enhancing adaptive capacity),
   which, like mitigation, requires long-term policies at macro level.
   Facilitative adaptation and mitigation not only both reduce impacts, but

Abstract = {Inland recreational fisheries have social, economic, and ecological
   importance worldwide but these fisheries are increasingly challenged by
   the diverse effects of climate change. Coupled with other anthropogenic
   stressors, climate change has contributed to declines in freshwater
   biodiversity of greater severity than those observed across marine or
   terrestrial taxa. At a macro level, inland fisheries are experiencing
   declines. There are, however, a number of success stories, or `bright
   spots,' in inland recreational fisheries management, where innovative
   approaches are leading to increases in social and ecological well-being
   in the face of climate change. Cases such as these are important sources
   of inspiration and learning about adaptation to climate and
   environmental change. In this article, we analyze 11 examples of such
   `bright spots' drawn from multiple jurisdictions around the world from
   which we extracted lessons that might apply to fisheries management
   challenges beyond the region and context of each case. Collectively,
   these bright spots highlight adaptive initiatives that allow for
   recreational fisheries management to mitigate to stressors associated
   with current and future climate change. Examples identified include
   community-based restoration projects, collaborative and adaptive
   approaches to short-term fisheries closures, transdisciplinary
   large-scale conservation projects, and conservation-minded efforts by
   individuals and communities. By highlighting examples of `small wins'
   within inland recreational fisheries management, this review contributes
   to the idea that a `positive future' for inland recreational fisheries
   in the face of climate change is possible and highlights potential
   strategies to adapt to current and future climate scenarios.},

   towards a climate-resilient future. Nature-based solutions offer the
   potential to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified
   ecosystems while providing multiple other benefits for health, the
   economy, society and the environment. However, the implementation of
   nature-based solutions stems from a discourse that is almost exclusively
   derived from a terrestrial and urban context and assumes that risk
   reduction is resolved locally. We argue that this position ignores the
   importance of complex ecological interactions across a range of temporal
   and spatial scales and misses the substantive contribution from marine
   ecosystems, which are notably absent from most climate mitigation and
   adaptation strategies that extend beyond coastal disaster management.
   Here, we consider the potential of sediment-dwelling fauna and flora to
   inform and support nature-based solutions, and how the ecology of
   benthic environments can enhance adaptation plans. We illustrate our
   thesis with examples of practice that are generating, or have the
   potential to deliver, transformative change and discuss where further
   innovation might be applied. Finally, we take a reflective look at the
   realized and potential capacity of benthic-based solutions to contribute
   to adaptation plans and offer our perspectives on the suitability and
   shortcomings of past achievements and the prospective rewards from
   sensible prioritization of future research. This article is part of the
   theme issue `Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and
   solutions'.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are responsible for a wide array of ecosystem services
   including shoreline protection. However, the processes involved in
   delivering this particular service have not been fully understood. The
   objective of the present review was to compile the main results in the
   literature regarding the study of shoreline protection delivered by
   coral reefs, identifying the main threats climate change imposes to the
   service, and discuss mitigation and recovery strategies that can and
   have been applied to these ecosystems. While different zones of a reef
   have been associated with different levels of wave energy and wave
   height attenuation, more information is still needed regarding the
   capacity of different reef morphologies to deliver shoreline protection.
   Moreover, the synergy between the main threats imposed by climate change
   to coral reefs has also not been thoroughly investigated. Recovery
   strategies are being tested and while there are numerous mitigation
   options, the challenge remains as to how to implement them and monitor
   their efficacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Failure to take climate change seriously enough has resulted in the
   world now facing a climate emergency, with rising global temperatures,
   melting polar ice caps, increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods
   and droughts, and rising sea levels. Despite being the first country in
   the world to set statutory carbon emissions reduction targets (in the
   Climate Change Act 2008), the UK government since 2012 has fallen
   increasingly behind, even by its own standards. This paper details what
   this has meant in terms of specific policies and identifies some of the
   reasons for this policy failure: in particular, a negative attitude
   towards regulation and a return to a reliance on market forces, plus an
   overriding concern to continue with `business as usual', in terms of
   support for fossil-fuel industries and ever-increasing energy demand and
   supply. Ironically, this has resulted in a situation where radical
   solutions seem even more necessary and more urgent.},

Abstract = {The Urbanocene, a proposed new geological epoch characterized by the
   urban living condition, is pressing the humanity to respond shortly to
   important challenges. Cities are at the same time the places where we
   live in and the big dissipators of the final energy to the environment.
   The simultaneous rules of heat dissipator and place to live are quite
   contradictory, because of the increasing temperatures of the dissipator
   surfaces, phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). Mediterranean
   climates should suffer, in the next years, changes in the thermal needs
   of buildings and in the outdoor comfort sensations. A change in the
   energy demand from heating to cooling is probable and overheating
   reduction could be a priority in the future. Many mitigation strategies
   of UHI are being discussed in these years, such as the city greening,
   the use of cool materials for roofs and soils, the reduction of
   automobile dependence, the shift to new urban morphologies. In this
   paper an evaluation of impacts of different possible strategies is done,
   by using computational simulations for various sectors of Rome and
   Valparaiso. Results show the importance of greening and traffic
   reduction to achieve better comfort; while to reduce building energy
   consumption changes in urban morphology and traffic are suggested as the
   best strategies.},

Title = {Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change on the South Australian
   coast: a coastal community perspective},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {139},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-56},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Over the last 20years the intergovernmental panel on climate change has
   produced a number of assessments on global climate change impacts,
   adaptation and vulnerability. In 2009, the Australian government
   conducted its own assessment of climate change risks to the Australian
   coast. In South Australia, there has been progress in actions to address
   issues for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Of particular note
   are the South Australian policies on coast protection and new coastal
   development (1991), and coastal erosion, flooding and sea-level rise
   (1992). These state policies remain in place despite recent debate in
   the literature over global and regional rates and potential impacts of
   sea-level rise, which show sea-level rise is tracking at the upper end
   of projections. An increasing coastal population and a growing amount of
   coastal property and related infrastructure deemed at risk', is also
   creating pressure to review coastal policies nationwide. This paper
   presents an assessment of the vulnerability of the South Australian
   coast to the impacts of climate change from a biophysical perspective
   and incorporates primary research conducted into the public perceptions
   of risk, using data from sea change communities in regional South
   Australia. It investigates the social implications of, and potential
   for, adaptation beyond the existing policy framework. This paper argues
   that research into climate change-risk perceptions can offer insight
   into the development of more suitable adaptation policy at local and
   regional scales by considering the attitudes and perceptions of multiple
   and varied groups of coastal stakeholders. The paper concludes that
   perceptions of risk and opportunities for adaptation play an important
   role in the assessment of vulnerability, and are an important tool for
   informing policy decisions.},

Title = {Heat island effects in urban life cycle assessment: Novel insights to
   include the effects of the urban heat island and UHI-mitigation measures
   in LCA for effective policy making},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {410-423},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urbanization often entails a surge in urban temperature compared to the
   rural surroundings: the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Such a
   temperature increase triggers the formation of pollutants worsening the
   urban air quality. Jointly, bad air quality and UHI affect ecosystems
   and human health. To alleviate the impacts on the population and the
   environment, it is crucial to design effective UHI-mitigation measures.
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an assessment tool able to capture the
   complexity of urban settlements and quantify their impact. Yet, as
   currently implemented, LCA neglects the interactions between the built
   environment and the local climate, omitting the resulting impacts. This
   study reviews the existing literature, showing the lack of studies that
   organically include interactions between the built environment and local
   climate in LCA. This forms the basis to identify the unsuitability of
   the current LCA framework for comprehensively capturing the impact of
   urban settlements. To overcome this limitation, this research offers a
   pathway to expand the LCA methodology, indicating the necessity to (a)
   couple the LCA methodology with climate models or physical relations
   that quantify the interactions between the local climate and the built
   environment; (b) include novel impact categories in LCA to address such
   interactions; and (c) use existing or ad hoc developed characterization
   factors to assess the impacts related to the UHI effect. The LCA
   community can build on the frame of reference offered by this research
   to overcome the current limitations of LCA and enable its use for a
   comprehensive assessment of the impacts of UHI and its mitigation
   measures.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation in coastal Australia: An audit of planning
   practice},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {100-109},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examines the state of local practice in planning for climate
   change adaptation in coastal Australia, in the context of rapidly
   evolving policy frameworks, using grounded theory to examine the process
   communities follow as they undertake adaptation planning. Australia's
   coastal cities and towns, with over 85 per cent of the nation's
   population, are at the frontline of physical risks associated with sea
   level rise and changed weather patterns; exacerbated by ongoing
   concentration of public and private assets in potentially vulnerable
   locations. This is particularly so for coastal councils beyond the major
   capital cities, where settlement patterns and lifestyle oriented
   economies based on tourism and leisure focus on the coastal strip, and
   local government resources are highly constrained. To assess progress in
   climate change adaptation planning, this study involved local government
   professionals, experts and elected officials through a survey and focus
   groups (n = 49) held between February and July 2011. The audit indicates
   some areas are well underway towards holistic adaptation strategies but,
   others have neither engaged, nor anticipate, adaptation planning
   activities; of the strategies that have commenced, few are yet
   completed; and, despite ongoing development pressure, few councils have
   yet changed their planning controls for climate risk. Of those areas
   that have commenced adaptation planning, most strategies and commitments
   will require additional resourcing and external expertise to implement;
   while others face community skepticism and ``pushback{''} which may
   undermine future progress. The results reveal a ladder of adaptation
   action, whereby communities tend to have to accomplish early steps
   before they move on to more complex, expensive, or political policies.
   We connect this ladder to community perceptions of what is supported in
   state and national frameworks and legislation. Communities in the future
   may be able to use this ladder to suggest where to start their
   processes, and directions to undertake as they accomplish their first
   tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Compensatory mechanisms to climate change in the widely distributed

Abstract = {The adaptation of plants to future climatic conditions is crucial for
   their survival. Not surprisingly, phenotypic responses to climate change
   have already been observed in many plant populations. These responses
   may be due to evolutionary adaptive changes or phenotypic plasticity.
   Especially plant species with a wide geographic range are either
   expected to show genetic differentiation in response to differing
   climate conditions or to have a high phenotypic plasticity. We
   investigated phenotypic responses and plasticity as an estimate of the
   adaptive potential in the widespread species Silene vulgaris. In a
   greenhouse experiment, 25 European populations covering a geographic
   range from the Canary Islands to Sweden were exposed to three
   experimental precipitation and two temperature regimes mimicking a
   possible climate-change scenario for central Europe. We hypothesized
   that southern populations have a better performance under high
   temperature and drought conditions, as they are already adapted to a
   comparable environment. We found that our treatments significantly
   influenced the plants, but did not reveal a latitudinal difference in
   response to climate treatments for most plant traits. Only flower number
   showed a stronger plasticity in northern European populations (e.g.
   Swedish populations) where numbers decreased more drastically with
   increased temperature and decreased precipitation treatment. Synthesis.
   The significant treatment response in Silene vulgaris, independent of
   population origin - except for the number of flowers produced - suggests
   a high degree of universal phenotypic plasticity in this widely
   distributed species. This reflects the likely adaptation strategy of the
   species and forms the basis for a successful survival strategy during
   upcoming climatic changes. However, as flower number, a strongly
   fitness-related trait, decreased more strongly in northern populations
   under a climate-change scenario, there might be limits to adaptation
   even in this widespread, plastic species.},

Journal = {FISHERIES},
Year = {1990},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Pages = {33-38},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Several government agencies are evaluating policy options for addressing
   global climate change.  These include planning for anticipated effects
   and developing mitigation options where feasible if climate does change
   as predicted.  For fisheries resources, policy questions address effects
   on international, national, and regional scales.  Climate change
   variables expected to affect inland and offshore fisheries include
   temperature rise, changes in the hydrologic cycle, alterations in
   nutrient fluxes, and reduction and relocation of spawning and nursery
   habitat.  These variables will affect resources at all levels of
   biological organization, including the genetic, organism, population,
   and ecosystem levels.  In this context, changes in primary productivity,
   species composition in the food-web, migration, invasions, synchrony in
   biological cycles, shifts in utilization of niches, and problems of
   larvae entrainment in estuaries have been identified.  Maintaining
   ecosystem robustness (i.e., high biodiversity) is another component of
   the problem.  Action requires establishing priorities for information
   needs, determining appropriate temporal and spatial scales at which to
   model effects, and accounting for interactive changes in physical and
   biological cycles.  A policy response can be derived when these results
   are integrated with social needs and human population constraints.},

Abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) has been garnering increasing attention in
   research and development, since it has been proposed as a promising
   technology for desalinating hypersaline brine from various industries
   using low-grade thermal energy. However, depending on the application
   context, MD faces several important technical challenges that would lead
   to compromised performance or even process failure. These challenges
   include pore wetting, mineral scaling, and membrane fouling. This review
   is devoted to providing a state-of-the-art understanding of fundamental
   mechanisms and mitigation strategies regarding these three challenges.
   Guided by the fundamental understanding of each membrane failure
   mechanism, we discuss both operational and material strategies that can
   potentially address the three technical challenges. In particular, the
   material strategies involve the development of MD membranes with
   tailored special wetting properties to impart resistance against
   different types of membrane failure. Lastly, we also discuss research
   needs and best practices in future studies to further enhance our
   ability to overcome technical challenges toward the practical,
   sustainable, and scalable applications of MD.},

Title = {Observed changes in temperature extremes for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei

Abstract = {As one of the most significant threats facing the world, climate change
   has already been manifested everywhere in the form of frequent extreme
   climate events (e.g. heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires) and has
   caused serious impacts on all aspects of the living environment. Due to
   the regional variability of global climate change, understanding the
   ongoing climatic changes at a local scale is very important for decision
   makers and resource managers to develop appropriate mitigation and
   adaptation strategies against the changing climate. In this study,
   recent changes in extreme temperature indices (including frost days,
   summer days, icy days, tropical nights, growing season length, cool
   nights and warm nights, cool days and warm days, and daily temperature
   range) over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China were
   investigated in the context of global warming. The results indicate that
   the historical trends of these extreme temperature indices are
   statistically significant in Huailai, Beijing, Leting and Shijiazhuang
   while no significant trends are reported in Chengde, Tianjin and
   Cangzhou-Potou. By comparing results between coastal and inland
   stations, it is found that the changes in temperature extremes in inland
   stations are less significant than the changes in coastal stations. The
   results also suggest that the indices based on minimum temperature show
   decreasing trends while those for maximum temperature present increasing
   trends. Furthermore, mutation tests were performed for all indices in
   order to understand when the changes were initiated. An apparent
   mutation point (mostly in the 1980s) is detected for most of the
   analysed temperature indices. This may be caused by the wide
   implementation of the reform and opening policy in the early 1980s to
   boost economic development in the BTH region.},

Abstract = {We introduce a catastrophic risk model that captures the cumulative

   The annual growth rates of expected losses due to change in climate
   patterns (or ``climate change factor{''}) are estimated based upon
   historical storm activities in the Atlantic Basin and catastrophe
   modelling. The percentiles of the climate change factor are then used to
   measure expected hurricane losses in the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia.
   We also undertake benefit-cost analyses on four adaptation measures for
   homes in St. Lucia and determine when those are cost-effective for
   different time horizons and discount rates with and without climate
   change. Adaptation makes an enormous difference and can offset
   additional losses even with a high climate change factor by making
   houses much more resilient. Enforcing these protection measures will be
   critical.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change are causing more frequent extreme rainfall
   events and an increased risk of flooding in developed areas. Quantifying
   this increased risk is of critical importance for the protection of life
   and property as well as for infrastructure planning and design. The
   updated National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships and temporal patterns
   are widely used in hydrologic and hydraulic modeling for design and
   planning in the United States. Current literature shows that rising
   temperatures as a result of climate change will result in an
   intensification of rainfall. These impacts are not explicitly included
   in the NOAA temporal patterns, which can have consequences on the design
   and planning of adaptation and flood mitigation measures. In addition
   there is a lack of detailed hydraulic modeling when assessing climate
   change impacts on flooding. The study presented in this paper uses a
   comprehensive hydrologic and hydraulic model of a fully developed
   urban/suburban catchment to explore two primary questions related to
   climate change impacts on flood risk. (1) How do climate change effects
   on storm temporal patterns and rainfall volumes impact flooding in a
   developed complex watershed? (2) Is the storm temporal pattern as
   critical as the total volume of rainfall when evaluating urban flood
   risk? We use the NOAA Atlas 14 temporal patterns, along with the
   expected increase in temperature for the RCP8.5 scenario for 2081-2100,
   to project temporal patterns and rainfall volumes to reflect future
   climatic change. The model results show that different rainfall patterns
   cause variability in flood depths during a storm event. The changes in
   the projected temporal patterns alone increase the risk of flood
   magnitude up to 35 \%, with the cumulative impacts of temperature rise
   on temporal patterns and the storm volume increasing flood risk from 10
   to 170 \%. The results also show that regional storage facilities are
   sensitive to rainfall patterns that are loaded in the latter part of the
   storm duration, while extremely intense short-duration storms will cause
   flooding at all locations. This study shows that changes in temporal
   patterns will have a significant impact on urban/suburban flooding and
   need to be carefully considered and adjusted to account for climate
   change when used for the design and planning of future storm water
   systems.},

   lens on climate adaptation and the EU's coastal and marine policy},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {44-51},

Abstract = {Integration of relatively new policy tasks like climate adaptation into
   established higher-level policy fields is insufficiently understood in
   the academic literature. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the
   integration of climate adaptation into the sectoral policy-making of the
   European Commission, particularly following the publication of the EU
   Adaptation Strategy (in 2013). The paper uses a framework of micro, meso
   and macro-level Institutional behaviour drawing strongly on new
   institutionalism perspectives to identify and explain factors enabling
   and hindering policy integration. It focuses on integration in the
   coastal and marine policy sector, which is expected to be particularly
   vulnerable to climate change impacts, and draws from data collected
   through a document review and interviews with key informants. The
   findings show that the integration of climate adaptation is still at an
   early stage. The integration process appears to be largely dependent on
   institutional dynamics at the EU-level combined with how member states
   and wider sectoral stakeholders engage with adaptation concerns. In
   particular, the ambivalence of some member states and a lack of urgency
   among sectoral stakeholders has hampered the integration of adaptation
   goals.},

Abstract = {Before climate change is considered in long-term coastal management, it
   is necessary to investigate how institutional stakeholders in coastal
   management conceptualize climate change, as their awareness will
   ultimately affect their actions. Using questionnaires in eight Baltic
   Sea riparian countries, this study examines environmental managers'
   awareness of climate change. Our results indicate that problems related
   to global warming are deemed secondary to short-term social and economic
   issues. Respondents agree that problems caused by global warming will
   become increasingly important, but pay little attention to adaptation
   and mitigation strategies. Current environmental problems are expected
   to continue to be urgent in the future. We conclude that an apparent gap
   exists between decision making, public concerns, and scientific
   consensus, resulting in a situation in which the latest evidence rarely

Abstract = {Purpose Lanzarote, Spain, as a tourism destination, suffered a rapid
   tourist expansion for many years, and this has endangered its
   sustainability. The purpose of this study is to investigate the case of
   overtourism and its consequences for the local population and the
   environment, and to identify ways to mitigate this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach The study uses a case study approach. Data
   obtained from tourists visiting the destination were used to examine
   three key aspects of tourism development, namely, the arrival of
   tourists to the island, the accommodation offer and the growth of the
   population. Social awareness with environmental values and protection of
   the island's natural resources were the main engine to establish
   measures to mitigate overtourism. Findings The analysis shows rapid
   growth in the arrival of tourists to the island and how it affected the
   accommodation offer and the population. It explores the solution that
   the authorities of the island took to solve the problem of disorganized
   growth of tourism and makes reference to the importance of managing the
   image of a destination to contribute to tourism sustainability.
   Originality/value This research proposes practical solutions to tackle
   overtourism at a destination which has been used by the United Nations
   as an example to establish sustainable tourism development guidelines.
   It proposes a unique mitigation strategy which is derived from the use
   of natural recreation.},

Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Pacific Island countries, like the Cook Islands, are often considered to
   be extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Considerable
   literature highlights that local knowledge can play an important role in
   climate change adaptation, particularly in small island countries.
   However, there is less understanding on how to practically integrate and
   apply local knowledge in climate change adaptation, particularly in the
   Cook Islands. This research investigated the role of local knowledge in
   climate change adaptation in the Cook Islands, aiming to understand the
   role of local knowledge in adaptation policies and the challenges of
   incorporating local knowledge into climate change adaptation policy
   through semistructured interviews with key informants and local
   participants. Key informants often recognized the important role of
   local knowledge in climate change adaptation while local knowledge was
   less recognized by local participants. Concerns over both the usefulness
   of the knowledge today and the loss of this knowledge were expressed.
   Additionally, challenges to integrating local knowledge into climate
   change policy were identified, including development pressure,
   out-migration, and a lack of understanding of local knowledge. This
   study offers insight into the role of local knowledge in climate change
   adaptation for other small island countries facing similar challenges.},

Title = {Three ways social identity shapes climate change adaptation},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is inescapably influenced by processes of
   social identity-how people perceive themselves, others, and their place
   in the world around them. Yet there is sparse evidence into the specific
   ways in which identity processes shape adaptation planning and
   responses. This paper proposes three key ways to understand the
   relationship between identity formation and adaptation processes: (a)
   how social identities change in response to perceived climate change
   risks and threats; (b) how identity change may be an objective of
   adaptation; and (c) how identity issues can constrain or enable adaptive
   action. It examines these three areas of focus through a synthesis of
   evidence on community responses to flooding and subsequent policy
   responses in Somerset county, UK and the Gippsland East region in
   Australia, based on indepth longitudinal data collected among those
   experiencing and enacting adaptation. The results show that adaptation
   policies are more likely to be effective when they give individuals
   confidence in the continuity of their in-groups, enhance the self-esteem
   of these groups, and develop their sense of self-efficacy. These
   processes of identity formation and evolution are therefore central to
   individual and collective responses to climate risks.},

Abstract = {This study examined the nature and correlates of child marriage in eight
   villages in climate-affected coastal Bangladesh using a mixed-methods
   approach: focus group discussions and in-depth qualitative interviews of
   female victims of child marriage as well as quantitative data collected
   using structured interviews of households. More than two-thirds of the
   qualitative survey respondents had encountered at least one event of
   natural disaster before marriage. Quantitative data confirmed
   significantly higher exposure to flood and river erosion among the
   coastal population. The quantitative data also suggested a positive
   association between shocks related to climate events and the incidence
   of child marriage, while the qualitative data indicated multiple themes
   related to the causes of child marriage, such as economic vulnerability,
   coping with risk and patriarchal norms. Yet the qualitative study
   respondents did not directly refer to natural disasters and climate
   changes when narrating their marital histories. The qualitative and
   quantitative evidence does not suggest that dowry-related factors are
   leading to early marriage. Rather, child marriage appears to be a coping
   strategy adopted by households in response to their increased
   vulnerability to natural disasters.},

Abstract = {Inhabitants of Pacific small island states are facing multiple
   socio-ecological pressures, with climate change being one of the most
   prominent. Nevertheless, the agency of local stakeholders in decisions
   on how to adapt to climate-related environmental change has been largely
   underappreciated in the climate change sciences as well as in policy
   decisions. We, therefore, conducted a survey study in Tuvalu, Samoa, and
   Tonga, asking specifically how residents perceive their situation
   regarding climate-related challenges, what adaptation strategies they
   have devised and implemented, and what they expect of governmental and
   nongovernmental organisations in these efforts. In contrast to the
   common perception that Pacific small island states are primarily
   threatened by rising sea levels, residents' perceptions indicate that
   drought, cyclones and other flood-related problems pose a far more
   imminent danger. Our results suggest that further research on those
   perceived environmental changes is advisable to provide reliable data
   for scientific models and policy decisions.},

Abstract = {The North American Laurentian Great Lakes hold nearly 20 \% of the
   earth's unfrozen fresh surface water and have a length of coastline, and
   a coastal population, comparable to frequently-studied marine coasts.
   The surface water elevations of the Great Lakes, in particular, are an
   ideal metric for understanding impacts of climate change on large
   hydrologic systems, and for assessing adaption measures for absorbing
   those impacts. In light of the importance of the Great Lakes to the
   North American and global economies, the Great Lakes and the surrounding
   region also serve as an important benchmark for hydroclimate research,
   and offer an example of successful adaptive management under changing
   climate conditions. Here, we communicate some of the important lessons
   to be learned from the Great Lakes by examining how the coastline, water
   level, and water budget dynamics of the Great Lakes relate to other
   large coastal systems, along with implications for water resource
   management strategies and climate scenario-derived projections of future
   conditions. This improved understanding fills a critical gap in
   freshwater and marine global coastal research.},

Abstract = {Port cities are on the frontline of emerging coastal risks related to
   climate change, sea-level rise, and human impacts on coastal zones. This
   article addresses the need for adaptation in port cities. It reviews key
   meanings of coastal climate adaptation, and its inherent complexity and
   uncertainties. It then provides an overview of the current status of
   coastal climate adaptation, discusses `adaptation deficits' in port
   cities, and describes barriers to adaptation. Subsequently, it
   highlights the need for adaptive (coastal) planning and management in
   the face of changing and uncertain future conditions. Finally, it points
   out research needs and challenges regarding adaptation in port cities,
   namely the need for localized risk assessments, the need to reduce
   adaptation deficits, the need to mainstream adaptation into spatial
   planning, the need for advanced studies on adaptation measures, the need
   for integrated efforts, the need for adaptive planning approaches for
   dealing with changing risks over time, under uncertainty in highly

Title = {Connecting Future Environmental Trends and Assessments of Fish and
   Wildlife Resources of Concern: A Case Study of Big Pine Key, Florida},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Changes in hydrologic and climatic trends will influence the ecology of
   Florida, and climate scenarios agree that many areas of Florida are
   susceptible to sea-level rise impacts. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service's Climate Change Action Program focuses on a framework to
   examine climate change effects on fish, wildlife, plants, and habitats
   of all three. To follow the program, this study examines how to
   incorporate current scientific knowledge about regional climate
   projections in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analyses. It provides
   climate change and sea-level rise projections based on 2017 projections,
   information on changes in tropical cyclones, temperatures, and
   precipitation. This study also examines future effects of sea-level rise
   on existing habitat from saltwater intrusion of the freshwater lens
   below Big Pine Key. Projections of future sea-water elevations will
   periodically be reached or exceeded well before 2040 from short-term,
   stochastic, and extreme events (e.g., king tides and storm surge), and
   will increasingly inundate the root zone before complete saltwater
   intrusion. Future trends were connected to 2017 stakeholder-driven
   conversations about adaptation strategies to develop a suite of actions
   for creating temporary or permanent freshwater resources. However,
   beyond 3 ft (0.9 m) of sea-level rise, there are few adaptation options
   available for the Florida Key deer beyond relocations outside of the
   Florida Keys. Overall, the approach of connecting future environmental
   trends to assessments of fish and wildlife resources of concern can be
   transferred to other situations. Additionally, this approach can be used
   to update these analyses, such as with the recent 2022 sea-level rise
   updates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, released
   after this work was conducted.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper extends the work of previous research by investigating
   surfing practices and surf-recreation companies from a behavioral
   perspective. The study's main aim is to gain insights into the role of
   meteorological/climatological information in decision-making related to
   the surf-tourism activities market. This information was gathered
   employing an online survey that asked respondents about where they surf
   and how they check forecasts for surfing. Climate services (CS) are
   promoted to support the decision-making process to better prepare for
   and adapt to the risks and opportunities of climate variability and
   change. The current market for CS is still in its early stages. In this
   paper, we report the findings from our recent investigation into the
   actual and potential market for CS for the Iberian Peninsula
   surf-tourism sector. Based on surfers' and surf companies' demands, it
   was found that an improved surfing climate service (herein, SCS) will
   have clear implications in the management of these tourism areas and
   provide insights into whether surfing activities may be successful. At
   the same time, such services can help to manage adaptive actions in
   regard to the impacts of climate change in surfing areas.},

Abstract = {Periodic river floods have devastating social and economic impacts on
   poor households in the low-lying coastal and western regions of Kenya.
   This paper focuses on how households in Bunyala District coped with the
   impacts of flooding, and particularly the December 2011 River Nzoia
   flood. The data for the study was collected through a survey of 400
   households, three focus group discussions, four in-depth interviews and
   six key informant interviews. Of the surveyed household-heads, 393
   (98.4\%) reported negative impacts of the flood on farming, livestock
   and/or property. Coping strategies at household level included temporary
   relocation and migration, reduced expenditure on household needs,
   engagement in extra income-generating activities, selling of property
   and reliance on support from public and private agencies. The findings
   reveal that many of the coping measures that people use are erosive, as
   they have negative long-term effects on household livelihood
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {The ability to respond to the challenges posed by climate change depends
   on the adaptive capacities of social and ecological systems. However,
   the term adaptive capacity is ill defined, and applications often ignore
   social dimensions. Furthermore, the dominant frameworks conceptualizing
   adaptive capacity terminate with a vulnerability assessment, without
   considering how such assessments help inform decisions to undertake
   adaptation actions. We propose a framework that links social and
   ecological adaptive capacity to conservation decisions. We illustrate
   our framework in the context of the Sky Islands ecoregion of the
   southwestern United States. Supporting a transdisciplinary approach, we
   outline four recommendations for incorporating social and ecological
   adaptive capacity into adaptation decisions that include convening key
   actors, the coproduction of science, and ultimately providing a means
   for decision-makers to learn from adaptation efforts. These measures to
   better define and leverage social and ecological adaptive capacity will
   support conservation decision-making in a world of rapid socioecological
   change.},

Abstract = {Collaboration and cooperation between and across countries, communities,
   and individuals is critical for the capacity of social-ecological
   systems (SES) to respond to climate change. In Solomon Islands, the tuna
   fisheries' SES provides food security, income, employment, and
   contributes significantly to the nation's economy. However, being at the
   frontline of climate change impacts, the fisheries' SES is under threat,
   and these impacts will compound existing challenges. We explore Solomon
   Islands' tuna fisheries' SES resilience and vulnerability with a focus
   on examining efforts towards coordination, cooperation, and
   collaboration within the fisheries and governance framework. The
   research reveals a `Pacific-way' of building resilience through multiple
   scales of collaborative and cooperative governance. Regional level
   collaborative forums such as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement,
   national fisheries programmes setting up coordination and cooperative
   networks, and local cooperative and coordination efforts that carry out
   multiple functions also build tuna fisheries' SES resilience to climate
   change. Western technical and top-down approaches translate into social
   resilience when coupled with education and outreach and leveraged upon
   existing grass-roots collaborative and cooperative networks. These
   cross-scale linkages of collaboration and adaptation strategies form
   resilience across multiple scales of governance. However, it is
   important to have a deliberate multi-scalar climate change adaptation
   framework.},

Abstract = {Flood mitigation and adaptation measures, among other tools to improve
   resiliency, will be necessary to sustain coastal communities in the face
   of climate change. Key to successful adaptation will be engineering
   projects, and critical to the success of those projects will be
   community engagement and support. Despite the recognized importance of
   community engagement when addressing complex issues like coastal
   flooding on which engineers work, most undergraduate engineering
   programs offer little to no training in community engagement. In this
   paper, we describe our experiences working with undergraduate
   engineering students to develop community-driven designs to address
   flooding and water quality issues in the Lake Mattamuskeet watershed in
   eastern North Carolina. Through an interdisciplinary approach, student
   teams learned to engage with local stakeholders to better integrate
   local knowledge and address issues identified by community members in
   their designs. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all community
   engagement aspects of the project moved to virtual forums, and we
   discuss the impact this shift had on the engineering designs as well as
   student learning outcomes and community connections.},

Title = {Evaluation of the threat from sea-level rise to the mangrove ecosystems
   in Tieshangang Bay, southern China},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise caused by global climate change has significant impacts
   on coastal zones. Mangrove ecosystems occur in the intertidal zone along
   tropical and subtropical coasts and are particularly sensitive to
   sea-level rise. We used the coastal zone of Tieshangang Bay, southern
   China, as a case study to evaluate the threats from sea-level rise to
   the mangrove ecosystems. The evaluation based on the projection of
   sea-level rise rates from present trend (2.9 mm/yr) and RCP4.5 scenario
   (0.53 m sea-level rise by 2100) of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report, were performed for 2025, 2050
   and 2100 using Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model. The results showed
   that the scenario using the present trend in the rate of sea-level rise
   would result in a 93\%, 9.6\% and 18.2\% loss of mangrove habitats at
   the study area in 2025, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Under the IPCC's
   RCP4.5 scenario, however, the higher sea-level rise rate could result in
   a 11.1\%, 12.2\% and 25.2\% loss of mangrove habitats in 2025, 2050 and
   2100, respectively. The SLAMM employed was able to project the spatially
   explicit threats of sea-level rise on the coastal mangroves in the study
   area. Without proper mitigation options, the potential decrease and loss
   of mangrove habitats and ecosystem services in Tieshangang Bay is
   inevitable. Based on the results of this study, mitigation measures
   should be considered for securing the mangrove ecosystems, including
   managing sedimentation and controlling reclamation and rehabilitation.

Title = {Relative importance of prey abundance and habitat structure as drivers
   of shorebird breeding success and abundance},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {535-543},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding large-scale drivers of animal breeding densities and
   demography has a range of important uses, including informing
   conservation management. Given the threat of climate change, the
   importance of developing a process-based understanding of variation in
   animal populations is increased to inform adaptive management. For a
   climate-change sensitive species, the European Golden Plover Pluvialis
   apricaria, we use novel field-collected data on large-scale spatial
   variation in prey abundance and vegetation structure to understand
   drivers of breeding abundance and breeding success, and inform potential
   management responses. The abundance of the key prey, crane flies
   (Tipulidae), increased with altitude (a surrogate for temperature) and
   peat depth (a surrogate for soil moisture). Golden plover breeding
   densities were highest where vegetation was shortest, probably
   reflecting greater prey accessibility. In contrast, breeding success was
   not strongly related to vegetation height, but positively correlated
   with both crane fly abundance and daily minimum temperatures. When
   combined to model the number of likely successful pairs in any 1 year,
   the magnitude of vegetation height effect far exceeded that of crane fly
   abundance. Thus, for golden plover and other shorebirds sharing similar
   habitats, management to optimize breeding habitat (grazing or burning to
   promote short vegetation) may differ from management to promote breeding
   success (drain blocking to increase soil moisture and prey abundance).
   Adaptive management in the face of climate change should therefore
   include appropriate vegetation management, as well as maximizing prey
   abundance. More broadly, as the drivers of breeding density and
   demographic parameters may differ, we advocate that conservation
   practitioners collect not just information on species' distributions but
   also underpinning demographic processes when using science to inform
   management.},

Title = {Improving the Climate Resilience of Rice Farming in Flood-Prone Areas
   through Azolla Biofertilizer and Saline-Tolerant Varieties},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rice farming in coastal areas is often victim to flooding as a result of
   climate change. Low-cost adaptation strategies are required to increase
   resilience and rice productivity in these flood-prone coastal areas. In
   this study, enriched Azolla extract (EAE) liquid biofertilizers,
   combined with selected stress-tolerant rice varieties, were tested in
   farmers' fields in Pangandaran, West Java from June to October 2020.
   This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of EAE in increasing
   the yield of different rice varieties. The research was arranged as a
   split-plot design with five replications. The main plot was the EAE
   application (T1 = 3 ton ha(-1) compost and T2 = 3 ton ha(-1) compost +
   10 L ha(-1) of EAE), and the sub-plots were stress-tolerant rice
   varieties (V1 = Inpari 43, V2 = Mawar, V3 = Inpari 30, V4 = Inpara 03,
   V5 = Mendawak). The application of EAE of 10 L ha(-1) significantly
   affected the rice grain yield, which was 37.06\% higher than that of the
   control plot. The average grain yield of the five varieties under EAE
   treatment (5.51 ton ha(-1)) was greater than the grain yield of local
   farmers' fields (3.78-4.97 ton ha(-1)). Inpari 43 had the highest grain
   yield with 5.90 ton ha(-1), but the yield was not significantly
   different from the Mendawak variety (4.90 ton ha(-1)). This result
   suggests that EAE and selected stress-tolerant rice varieties (Inpari 43
   or Mendawak) are an effective adaptation strategy to increase rice
   farms' resilience and productivity in coastal areas prone to flooding.},

Title = {A new framework for flood adaptation: introducing the Flood Adaptation
   Hierarchy},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Traditional flood risk paradigms and associated strategies are no longer
   sufficient to address global flood adaptation challenges due to climate
   change and continued development in floodplains. The current flood
   adaptation approach is failing to take advantage of the benefits
   provided by intact ecosystems and perpetuates social and economic
   inequities, leaving those who are most vulnerable at highest risk.
   Rooted in the experiences of the United States, we propose a new
   framework, the Flood Adaptation Hierarchy, which prioritizes outcomes
   into six tiers. Overall, the tiers distinguish between nature and
   nature-based solutions, with preference given to natural ecosystems. The
   most important outcome in our hierarchy is to avoid risk by protecting
   and restoring natural floodplains; next, eliminate risk by moving
   communities away from danger; and then to accommodate water with passive
   measures and active risk reduction measures. We include, but
   deprioritize, a defense of community assets using nature-based
   engineering and hardened engineering. Throughout the hierarchy, we
   provide guidance on the equity considerations of flood adaptation
   decision making and highlight ``impacts,{''} ``resources,{''} and
   ``voices{''} as important equity dimensions. Implementing the framework
   through an iterative process, using justification criteria to manage
   movement among tiers, alongside equity considerations, will support
   adaptation to changing environmental and social conditions and
   contribute to risk reduction at scale. Though this approach is focused
   on U.S. flood management and adaptation, prioritizing risk reduction,
   elimination of risk, and accommodation of hazards over the defense
   against threats not only has global applicability to flood adaptation,
   but should also be evaluated for applicability to other climate-driven
   challenges.},

Title = {Climate change effects in the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {46-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Evidences are accumulating on the long-term changes in seawater
   temperature, acidity, deoxygenation, cyclones and sea level in the Bay
   of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem. These changes have impacts on ocean
   productivity, habitats and biological processes. Distributional and
   phenological changes in fish species, and increase in frequency and
   intensity of coral bleaching are becoming evident. Fisheries,
   particularly traditional fisheries, will be the most vulnerable to
   climate change. Climate warming will also affect the inland and coastal
   aquaculture sectors of the Bay of Bengal LME countries. Impacts will
   include changes in hydrology and therefore availability of water,
   physical threats to aquaculture facilities, and prevalence or spread of
   known and new diseases of aquatic organisms. The most important and
   critical adaptation measures will be to develop human resources capacity
   to increase understanding of the marine resources, and implement
   measures to sustainably manage fisheries. Bay of Bengal Large Marine
   Ecosystem project's two main directions taken for climate change
   response are contribution to the understanding of large-scale processes
   and climate change effects on one hand, and contributions to adaptation
   by addressing habitat degradation, pollution and fisheries management,
   as well as developing capacity and resilience of coastal populations on
   the other. Recognizing that current problems in weak fisheries
   management make the sector vulnerable to climate change, BOBLME supports
   adaptation and increases resilience by strengthening fisheries
   management and providing assistance to improve fisheries assessments. By
   strengthening governance, BOBLME also contributes to the integration of
   climate change adaptation into decision-making and response initiatives,
   e.g. disaster risk management plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights

Title = {Implications of Allee effects for fisheries management in a changing
   climate: evidence from Atlantic cod},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There are concerns that increasing anthropogenic stressors can cause
   catastrophic transitions in ecosystems. Such shifts have large social,
   economic, and ecological consequences and therefore have important
   management implications. A potential mechanism behind these regime
   shifts is the Allee effect, which describes the decline in realized per
   capita growth rate at small population density. With an age-structured
   population model for Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, we illustrate how
   interactions between human-induced stressors, such as fishing and
   climate change, can worsen the impact of an Allee effect on populations
   by promoting hysteresis. Therefore, the risk of population collapse and
   recovery failure is exacerbated and the success of preventing and
   reverting collapse depends on the climate regime. We find that, in
   presence of the Allee effect, a fishing moratorium is only sufficient
   for recovery when sea surface temperature rise remains within 2 degrees
   C and fishing is restricted within 10 yrs. If sea surface temperature
   rises beyond 2 degrees C, even immediate banning of fishing is not
   sufficient to guarantee recovery. If fishing is not fully banned and a
   residual fishing pressure remains, the probability of recovery is
   further decreased, also in the absence of an Allee effect. The results
   underscore the decisive role of Allee effects for the management of
   depleted populations in an increasingly human-dominated world. Once the
   population collapses and its growth rate is suppressed, rebuilding
   measures will be squandered and collapse will very likely be
   irreversible. We therefore emphasize the need for proactive management
   involving precautionary, adaptive measures and reference points. Our
   studies shows that climate change has the potential to strengthen Allee
   effects, which could increasingly challenge fisheries management.},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems generate diverse services, such as protection,
   production of food, climate regulation and recreation across the globe.
   These services are vital for extremely vulnerable coastal areas for
   enhancing present and future adaptation capacity under changing climate.
   Bangladesh has long coastline which provides opportunities to large
   population for multiple resource uses; and threats from extreme natural
   disasters. The CBACC-Coastal Afforestation is the priority initiative of
   Bangladesh NAPA that has come in actions under first LDCF adaptation
   project. The project has focused to reduce climatic vulnerability
   through enhancing resilience of coastal forests and adaptive capacity of
   communities. With a total of 6,100 ha of new mangrove plantation and
   introducing 10 important mangrove species in existing monoculture areas,
   the project increased protective and carbon rich forest coverage, and
   also functional capacity of coastal vegetation to adapt to current and
   future climatic shocks. Concurrently, the project developed co-benefit
   regime for community based adaptation through innovating integrated land
   uses for livelihoods of adjacent households. A new land use model
   (Forest, Fish and Fruit-Triple F) has been implemented to restore fallow
   coastal lands into community based livelihood adaptation practices. The
   Triple F practice has reduced inundation and salinity risks and
   freshwater scarcity in cultivation of agricultural crops and fish. The
   rational land uses improved household adaptation capacity of landless
   households through short-, mid- and long-term income generation. The
   project lesson has further focus to justify the land use innovation for
   harnessing potential opportunities of ecosystem based adaptation in
   coastal Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to support the development risk management
   strategies towards improving the resilience of assets located in the
   estuary and lower level of the Swan River, Western Australia. The study
   evaluated the key role of Federal/State policies in adaptation planning
   and the communication and interface between various stakeholders,
   including State/Local governments, construction professionals, property
   developers and landowners.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study applied a mixed research
   approach through a questionnaire survey followed by an in-depth
   interview involving local construction experts. Collected data were
   analysed following the grounded theory methodology style of data
   analysis.
   Findings - The findings revealed a convoluted understanding of
   communication networks and responsibility for owning the future risks
   between relevant stakeholders. As a result, a framework illustrating
   clear process and roles in mitigating risk and implementing adaptive
   asset management measures has been formulated and presented in this
   study.
   Originality/value - Scientific evidence suggested that sea-level rise
   and increased frequency of major coastal flooding events are inevitable
   as early as 2100, and having a comprehensive risk management plan of
   assets to anticipate climate risks and to improve urban resilience is
   essential. The proposed framework is aimed at local stakeholders in
   improving current state of communication and adaptation planning as a
   pathway to develop a robust risk management strategy.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise poses a crisis for coastal communities. Many local
   governments have identified strategies to prepare for the impacts of sea
   level rise but often lack funding mechanisms. To date, the assumption
   that coastal adaptation is a public good has limited the tools used to
   finance responses to sea level rise. We argue that good characteristics
   - subtractability, excludability, heterogeneity, joint production, and
   capital intensity - combine in unique ways across adaptation strategies,
   and few strategies provide exclusively public goods. These good
   characteristics create political opportunities for application of
   financing mechanisms such as property taxes, district-level finance, and
   bonds that have been less commonly used for adaptation. Exploring the
   good characteristics of a particular adaptation strategy can help
   communities identify an appropriate and feasible mechanism for financing

Abstract = {The section of railway which runs along the coastline of south Devon in
   United Kingdom, from Exeter to Newton Abbot, is one of the most
   photographed sections of railway in the world. It was opened in 1846
   with embankments and seawalls protecting and supporting the railway,
   providing the route of an atmospheric railway. Despite regular
   maintenance however, there has been a history of storm damage, one of
   the most severe occurring in February 2014. This resulted in the
   collapse of the line, interruption of all rail traffic into and out of
   the far SouthWest of the United Kingdom (affecting parts of Devon and
   the whole of Cornwall) and significant damage to the region's economy.
   In order to improve the resilience of the line, several options have
   been considered to evaluate and reduce climate change impacts to the
   railway. This paper describes the methodological approach developed to
   evaluate the risks of flooding for a range of scenarios in the estuary
   and open coast reaches of the line. Components to derive the present day
   and future climate change coastal conditions including some possible
   adaptation measures are also presented together with the results of the
   hindcasting analysis to assess the performance of the modelling system.
   An overview of the modelling results obtained to support the development
   of a long-term Resilience Strategy for asset management is also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The extent of risk is the key measure of sustainable performance of
   engineering and natural systems and coastal aquifers are no exceptions.
   Aquifers in the coastal regions are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion
   (SWI) that attributes to the degradation of freshwater quality in the
   aquifers. The major factors that influence saline water intrusion are
   sea level rise due to climate change and the impact of human activities.
   The water quality erodes rapidly when these factors act simultaneously.
   Abstraction Desalinization Recharge (ADR) and Qanat-well structure
   methods are found to be effective methods to mitigate the risk in terms
   of cost and abstraction of groundwater in specific regions without
   intensifying saltwater intrusion. Risk management studies are useful to
   assess the vulnarabilty and economic loss involved in coastal aquifer
   management. In this paper, a review of risk assessment and mitigation
   measures of coastal aquifers vulnerable to saltwater intrusion is
   presented.},

Title = {Impacts of the training of mud crab farmers: An adaptation strategy to
   cope with salinity intrusion in Bangladesh},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {120},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change has caused salinity intrusion threatening Bangladesh's
   crop production system and coastal livelihoods. Mud crab (Scylla
   serrata) fattening was introduced as an adaptation strategy in the
   coastal areas. The present study assessed the impacts of the training of
   mud crab farmers on productivity and income by employing few econometric
   models. A total of 300 mud crab farmers were interviewed to achieve the
   objectives. Training had a positive and significant impact on
   productivity of mud crab fattening. The impact of training on
   productivity and income was 31\% and 19\%, respectively. Based on the
   treatment effect model, trained farmers achieved 22\% of higher
   productivity compared to non-trained farmers. The participation in the
   training was influenced by age, education, household wealth, and
   participation in field days. Policy implications included more
   investment in training facilities from public agencies to sustain and
   increase the productivity and income of crab farmers. Modifying the
   training approach could provide opportunity to young crab farmers to
   increase their know-how. Various government and non-government
   organizations working in the coastal areas need to promote the role of
   mud crab fattening in their anti-poverty programmes.},

Title = {Long-term trends in PM2.5 mass and particle number concentrations in
   urban air: The impacts of mitigation measures and extreme events due to
   changing climates},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {263},
Number = {A},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urbanisation and industrialisation led to the increase of ambient
   particulate matter (PM) concentration. While subsequent regulations may
   have resulted in the decrease of some PM matrices, the simultaneous
   changes in climate affecting local meteorological conditions could also
   have played a role. To gain an insight into this complex matter, this
   study investigated the long-term trends of two important matrices, the
   particle mass (PM2.5) and particle number concentrations (PNC), and the
   factors that influenced the trends. Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope
   estimator, the generalised additive model, seasonal decomposition of
   time series by LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) and the
   Buishand range test were applied. Both PM2.5 and PNC showed significant
   negative monotonic trends (0.03-0.6 mg m(-3).yr(-1) and 0.40-3.8 x 10(3)
   particles. cm(-3). yr(-1), respectively) except Brisbane (+0.1 mg m(-3).
   yr(-1) and +53 particles. cm(-3). yr(-1), respectively). For the period
   covered in this study, temperature increased (0.03-0.07 degrees
   C.yr(-1)) in all cities except London; precipitation decreased (0.02-1.4
   mm.yr(-1)) except in Helsinki; and wind speed was reduced in Brisbane
   and Rochester but increased in Helsinki, London and Augsburg. At the
   change-points, temperature increase in cold cities influenced PNC while
   shifts in precipitation and wind speed affected PM2.5. Based on the
   LOESS trend, extreme events such as dust storms and wildfires resulting
   from changing climates caused a positive step-change in concentrations,
   particularly for PM2.5. In contrast, among the mitigation measures,
   controlling sulphur in fuels caused a negative step-change, especially
   for PNC. Policies regarding traffic and fleet management (e.g. low
   emission zones) that were implemented only in certain areas or in a
   progressive uptake (e.g. Euro emission standards), resulted to gradual
   reductions in concentrations. Therefore, as this study has clearly shown
   that PM2.5 and PNC were influenced differently by the impacts of the
   changing climate and by the mitigation measures, both metrics must be
   considered in urban air quality management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {A large number of coastal structures have been constructed along the
   Indian coast for ports, harbors, shore protection, houses, industries
   etc for various human requirements, which are often found to result in
   major erosion/accretion issues along the coast making them
   counter-productive to the objective of coastal protection. Erosion
   results in loss of valuable land and property while accretion results in
   closure of river mouths resulting in floods in the upstream locations
   due to negligible exchange with the seawater. This is largely due to
   inadequate understanding of the morphological changes along the coast
   and shoreline response to introduction of structures and / or natural
   changes. More often coastal protection structures are built as an
   emergency response to shoreline changes from human and / or natural
   impacts which result in aggravating the situation. Detailed analysis of
   shoreline response several times indicate that a `Non-interference'
   might have been a better solution.
   It is therefore essential to design and develop, site specific coastal
   and estuarine infrastructure using the state-of-the-art analysis tools
   available for sustainable and effective performance. This study proposes
   to include the impact of coastal structures on the shoreline morphology
   through proven scientific techniques and identification of
   environmentally sustainable mitigation measures / resilient solutions.
   For meeting this objective, it is essential to create a database of
   morphological changes along the coastline of India based on NIOT's long
   term experience in coastal engineering. This data base shall enable the
   planning and design of sustainable infrastructure and shore protection
   schemes based on secondary and field data.
   In this paper two case studies along the Indian coast are discussed.
   From the analysis of historical data on the behavior of shorelines, it
   has been possible to evaluate the root cause of erosion/accretion. This
   is followed by use of numerical models for prediction of response
   considering site specific issues. The development of database of
   shoreline changes and the response of shoreline to various manmade /
   natural changes (ShoRES) enables incorporation of resilience in the
   mitigation measures thereby enabling creation of solutions that are
   sustainable.},

Abstract = {This chapter deals with the conceptualization, identification and
   assessment of the vulnerability of different social groups to water
   related hazards in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The Mekong Delta is
   globally seen as one of the key hotspots of climate change related risks
   due to its exposure to floods, salinization and potential sea level
   rise. In order to underline the multifaceted nature of vulnerability to
   natural hazards and climate change the paper outlines vulnerability pro
   files of different households and socio-economic groups in selected
   hazard prone areas, notably in rural communities exposed to high floods,
   coastal communities exposed to saline intrusion and urban communities
   exposed to urban and tidal flooding. The different locations selected
   for the assessment of vulnerability allow comparing how different local
   context situations and hazard phenomena might in fluence specific coping
   and adaptation strategies. The socio-economic transformation processes
   and policy reforms that have affected all three locations are examined
   in terms of their in fluence on vulnerability and capacities. The
   chapter provides a contribution to a further enhancement of methods,
   data bases and quality criteria for moving from an impact oriented risk
   assessment to a forward-looking vulnerability assessment that can inform
   future adaptation strategies. In this regard the chapter makes a
   contribution for linking disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate
   change adaptation (CCA) discourses. Particularly, the analysis of
   vulnerabilities to creeping-changes has often not been sufficiently
   addresses and incorporated in DRR strategies in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {There is only limited scientific literature on trial methodology, trial
   procedures and mitigation strategies to overcome challenges faced during
   clinical research taking place in resource constrained healthcare
   environments. Organisational, cultural, infrastructural and ethical
   challenges may vary between settings although conduct of clinical trials
   for the same disease (in our case soil-transmitted helminth (STH)
   infections) share similar risks for implementation. We use the example
   of a phase III randomised controlled trial, conducted between 2018 and
   2020 in Cote d'Ivoire, Lao PDR and Pemba Island (Tanzania), to share
   challenges faced and mitigation strategies to guide future planning of
   studies in similar settings. We describe the planning, screening,
   enrolment and implementation phases in each of the three settings. Our
   findings indicate that involvement of local staff and close
   collaboration are essential factors for successful trial preparation and
   implementation. A strategic plan adapted to each setting with a distinct
   focus on community engagement and workforce is crucial to proceed
   efficiently. Mutual trust between the trial population and the trial
   team is of utmost importance and allows for early reaction and adaption
   to emerging issues.},

Abstract = {Coastal zones are highly threatened by global sea-level rise (SLR), but
   human-induced change in SLR is often neglected in many studies.
   Identifying the influences of coastal use on regional SLR and their
   interactions is helpful to effectively respond to SLR. In this paper, we
   analyzed the relationship between SLR, coastal use and rising
   temperature at the provincial level in mainland China since 2000. The
   results show that there is significant correlation between increasing
   coastal use and SLR, but that relationship between temperature rising
   and SLR is not significant. This supports our hypothesis that coastal
   use can accelerate regional SLR on Chinese coasts, especially in the
   Bohai Sea. We also discuss the potentially influential mechanism of one
   important coastal use, reclamation, on SLR in the Bohai Sea and present
   suggestions for both coastal use management and adaptation to SLR for
   this region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Performance of urban storm drainage network under changing climate
   scenarios: Flood mitigation in Indian coastal city},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Managing storm water under climate uncertainty is a major concern in
   urban areas throughout the world. There were several floods events
   recorded in Chennai, a one of the major metropolitan coastal city in
   India. The flood incidences were repeatedly reported in recent decades.
   In this study, the existing state of storm water drains are evaluated
   under current and future climate scenarios in one of the most
   flood-prone areas of Chennai viz. Velachery zone. The mitigation
   measures are recommended to increase its resilience against floods. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) CMIP5 models of
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 are used to develop
   possible future climate change scenarios of the city. The daily rainfall
   data for the period 1975-2015 obtained from India Meteorological
   Department are used to find the extremities and to generate
   Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. The IDF curves are generated
   for 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 year return period under current and future
   climate scenarios. The storm drainage network are delineated with
   Differential Geographic Positioning System (DGPS) survey. The integrated
   hydraulic and hydrological modelling is carried out to assess the flood
   carrying capacity of storm drainage under present and future climate
   scenarios. The vulnerable hotspots are identified and flood mitigation
   measures are suggested to reduce the flood risk at Velachery.},

Abstract = {1. The global extent of marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased
   rapidly in the last decade, and monitoring and evaluation are now
   required for effective and adaptive management of these areas.
   2. We classify monitoring in MPAs into four categories and identify a
   critically important, but undervalued category: human pressure
   monitoring that targets human activities and their impacts.
   3. Human pressure monitoring is fundamental for interpreting the results
   of ecological performance monitoring and for evaluating MPA management
   effectiveness. The consequences of ecological performance monitoring
   that show unsuccessful MPA performance while falsely assuming successful
   mitigation of human pressures could jeopardize MPA performance analysis
   and adaptive management, and thus be worse than not monitoring at all.
   4. Human pressure monitoring enables using MPAs as reference areas where
   the effects of global or regional pressures (e.g. climate change) can be
   disentangled from the effects of local human activities, as well as to
   minimize the shifting baseline phenomenon in defining healthy stocks.
   These benefits cannot be realized without active human pressure
   monitoring integrated into an adaptive management cycle that ensures
   effective MPA protection.
   5. In the absence of human pressure monitoring, all ecological
   monitoring within MPAs falls in the ambient monitoring category:
   monitoring that is not intended to measure conservation outcomes.
   6. We discuss the implications for monitoring programme design and
   provide a structure for decision-makers on how to prioritize monitoring
   activities within MPAs that place greater emphasis onimprovingMPAs as
   biodiversity conservation tools overprovingMPA performance.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this research is to understand fishers'
   perceptions of climate change and to identify factors that influence
   their expectations concerning adapting to change. Two coastal
   communities at Salimpur on the Sitakunda coast and Sarikait in Sandwip
   Island were selected as a case study to analyse fishers' perceptions of
   climate change in southeastern Bangladesh. This research involved a
   questionnaire survey to interview 135 male fishers in two areas, who are
   professional fishers. Exploratory factor analysis and a binary logistic
   regression were adopted for empirical analysis. From the fishers
   surveyed, 84\% opined that they might adapt and continue the fishing
   profession in response to climate change. The results suggested that
   fishers, although they have experienced formal and institutional
   barriers to adaptation in response to climate change and pursued
   alternative livelihoods as adaptation strategies, may continue to a
   fishing profession in the future. On the contrary, the fishers who have
   generated a high fishing income and experienced extreme climate events
   may not continue to a fishing profession. Fishers also cited climatic
   factors along with non-climatic factors (fishing ban, no return on
   investment, low supply of caught fish) as the reasons hindering their
   adaptation strategies in response to climate change.},

Title = {Climate change and coconut plantations in India: Impacts and potential
   adaptation gains},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {45-54},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The assessment of impact of climate change on coconut, a plantation
   crop, is challenging. However, the development of a simulation model
   (InfoCrop-COCONUT) has enabled the process. We present the first
   simulation analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on
   coconut productivity in India following two approaches, namely: (i)
   `fixed increase in temperature and CO2, and (ii) scenarios as per PRECIS
   (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) - a regional climate
   model. Impact of changed management on coconut productivity in current
   as well as in future climates is also assessed. Climate change is
   projected to increase coconut productivity in western coastal region,
   Kerala, parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra (provided current
   level of water and management is made available in future climates as
   well) and also in North-Eastern states, islands of Andaman and Nicobar
   and Lakshadweep while negative impacts are projected for Andhra Pradesh,
   Orissa, West Bengal, Gujarat and parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. On
   all India basis, even with current management, climate change is
   projected to increase coconut productivity by 4.3\% in A1B 2030, 1.9\%
   in A1B 2080, 6.8\% in A2 2080 and 5.7\% in 82 2080 scenarios of PRECIS
   over mean productivity of 2000-2005 period. Agronomic adaptations like
   soil moisture conservation, summer irrigation, drip irrigation, and
   fertilizer application cannot only minimize losses in majority of
   coconut growing regions, but also improve productivity substantially.
   Further, genetic adaptation measures like growing improved local Tall
   cultivars and hybrids under improved crop management is needed for
   long-term adaptation of plantation to climate change, particularly in
   regions that are projected to be negatively impacted by climate change.
   Such strategy can increase the productivity by about 33\% in 2030, and
   by 25-32\% in 2080 climate scenarios. In fact, productivity can be
   improved by 20\% to almost double if all plantations in India are
   provided with above mentioned management even in current climates. In
   places where positive impacts are projected, current poor management may
   become a limiting factor in reaping the benefits of CO2 fertilization,
   while in negatively affected regions adaptation strategies can reduce
   the impacts. Thus, intensive genetic and agronomic adaptation to climate
   change can substantially benefit the coconut production in India. (C)

Title = {Drivers and Benefits of Integrating Climate Adaptation Measures into
   Urban Development: Experience from Coastal Cities of Indonesia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Integrating climate adaptation measures into urban development has
   emerged as a holistic approach to minimize climate change impacts and to
   enhance urban resilience. Although there has been an initial
   implementation of the integrated strategy at the national level, the
   progress of its adoption at the local level is relatively less studied.
   The study aims to examine the integration development of climate
   adaptation measures into urban development strategies by looking at its
   drivers and benefits in two coastal cities of Indonesia, i.e., Semarang
   and Bandar Lampung. Both cities have experienced climate change impacts
   and the preliminary effort of the integration process. The study was
   depended on close-ended Likert-scale questions with key actors
   representing local authorities and relevant stakeholders. Then, a
   Weighted Average Index was applied to transform their perceptions. The
   assessment of their knowledge of related issues was conducted. Secondary
   data was obtained from a desk study. The study found out that the effort
   of the integration process had influenced stakeholder's understanding of
   the issue of climate change and urban development, as well as its
   relationship. The level of stakeholder's knowledge related to the issue
   was very high. The result also revealed that the most influencing driver
   of the integration process is related to the motivation and initiative
   of municipal officers. It significantly contributed local governments to
   adopt its integration strategy. There was a strong consensus regarding
   the benefits of the integration process. They believed that it could
   ensure sustainable urban development in the future. This empirical study
   distinguishes the significance of integration development based on the
   local perspective for the approach improvement. The results could be
   applied to encourage other local municipalities in other emerging
   coastal cities.},

Abstract = {New South Wales (NSW) is on the east coast and one of the eight states
   and territories of Australia. NSW ocean Fisheries harvest 10,725 metric
   tons of fish and invertebrates valued at AUD\$66.7 million and include
   six major managed fisheries, ocean trap and line fishing, ocean prawn
   trawling, ocean fish trawling, ocean beach hauling, lobster and abalone
   harvesting. The legislative framework for reconciling fisheries with
   conservation in NSW is the Environment Impact Assessment process under
   the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. This determines whether
   management strategies prepared under the Fisheries Management Act will
   deliver ecologically sustainable fisheries. The environmental impact
   assessment is an important tool. It details likely impacts and allows
   for alternative management and mitigation measures when formulating
   fishery management strategies for each of the six wild capture fisheries
   to ensure conservation of coastal biodiversity. It enables the community
   to review and provide input to the proposed strategy and management
   regimes. It also informs decision makers of the likely costs and
   benefits of the strategy and the need for mitigation measures. The
   environmental assessment examines the impacts of the fishing activities
   on the environment and considers ecosystem information at multiple
   levels in addition to economic and social issues. Due to data deficiency
   the reconciling of fisheries with conservation in the environmental
   assessments is based on a multi-stage risk assessment.},

Abstract = {Natural disasters continue to hit urban areas worldwide, undermining
   community resilience capacity. The combination of increasing
   precipitation because of climate change, sea level rise, and
   uncontrolled rapid urbanization bring greater risk of flooding impacts
   in urban areas. Such flooding has a disproportionate effect on the urban
   poor, who often live in informal settlements. Meanwhile, the rapid
   expansion of informal settlements encroaching on floodplains that
   restrict the storage of flood waters and the expansion of impermeable
   urban surfaces also contribute to the increasing magnitude and frequency
   of flooding. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the urban poor as
   the most vulnerable community and also as key party in mitigation
   efforts. Although mitigation measures are currently in place to lessen
   the impact of climate change related floods in urban poor areas, little
   attention has been given to the use of green infrastructure as a
   mitigation strategy. Hence, this study aimed to examine current
   practices of green infrastructure (GI) in urban poor areas of Kibera
   (Kenya), Madurai (India) and Old Fadama (Ghana) to mitigate climate
   related flood impacts. Using the multiple case study method, it was
   investigated how urban stakeholders address and overcome the critical
   issues of governance, finance and awareness to secure the success of GI
   implementation. It was found that GI requires comprehensive
   understanding of political, social, economic and environmental aspects
   of the urban poor population to secure the success of initiatives, while
   cohesive cooperation and full participation of urban stakeholders is the
   key.},

Title = {Bacterial adaptive strategies to cope with metal toxicity in the
   contaminated environment-A review},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {226},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Heavy metal contamination poses a serious environmental hazard, globally
   necessitating intricate attention. Heavy metals can cause deleterious
   health hazards to humans and other living organisms even at low
   concentrations. Environmental biotechnologists and eco-toxicologists
   have rigorously assessed a plethora of bioremediation mechanisms that
   can hamper the toxic outcomes and the molecular basis for rejuvenating
   the hazardous impacts, optimistically. Environmental impact assessment
   and restoration of native and positive scenario has compelled biological
   management in ensuring safety replenishment in polluted realms often
   hindered by heavy metal toxicity. Copious treatment modalities have been
   corroborated to mitigate the detrimental effects to remove heavy metals
   from polluted sites. In particular, Biological-based treatment methods
   are of great attention in the metal removal sector due to their high
   efficiency at low metal concentrations, ecofriendly nature, and
   costeffectiveness. Due to rapid multiplication and growth rates,
   bacteria having metal resistance are advocated for metal removal
   applications. Evolutionary implications of coping with heavy metals
   toxicity have redressed bacterial adaptive/resistance strategies related
   to physiological and cross-protective mechanisms. Ample reviews have
   been reported for the bacterial adaptive strategies to cope with heavy
   metal toxicity. Nevertheless, a holistic review summarizing the redox
   reactions that address the cross-reactivity mechanisms between
   metallothionein synthesis, extracellular polysaccharides production,
   siderophore production, and efflux systems of metal resistant bacteria
   are scarce. Molecular dissection of how bacteria adapt themselves to
   metal toxicity can augment novel and innovative technologies for
   efficient detoxification, removal, and combat the restorative
   difficulties for stress alleviations. The present comprehensive
   compilation addresses the identification of newer methodologies,
   summarizing the prevailing strategies of adaptive/resistance mechanisms
   in bacterial bioremediation. Further pitfalls and respective future
   directions are enumerated in invigorating effective bioremediation
   technologies including overexpression studies and delivery systems. The
   analysis will aid in abridging the gap for limitations in heavy metal
   removal strategies and necessary cross-talk in elucidating the complex
   cascade of events in better bioremediation protocols.},

Abstract = {Flood is natural phenomenon that cannot be completely controlled by man.
   Flood is a global problem. Even urban areas which have good development
   planning and drainage systems are susceptible to floods. Flooding in
   urban area is usually associated with poor drainage system maintenance,
   failure to plan drainage system, area development is not planned
   properly, and climate change factors. Typically, engineering measures
   are meant to reduce severity of flood problems and they are quite
   costly. Goal of this paper is to assess the various mitigation
   approaches that have been used to mitigate floods across Europe, Oceania
   and Asia continents. Selected case studies involving the North Sea
   flood, as well as floods in the Netherlands, Scotland, New Zealand,
   Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia were considered.
   Approaches that were highlighted include construction of dam,
   breakwater, canal, and pumping system. It has also been found that flood
   solution methods by way of source control is not so popular to be fully
   practiced. Hence, the sustainability of good development is actually a
   solution to problem of flooding, especially to mitigate flash floods
   that often occur in an urban areas.},

   in small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to have increasing impacts on marine
   ecosystems which will threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of millions
   of people. Drawing on social-ecological network and sociodemographic
   data collected via face-to-face interviews with 404 small-scale
   commercial fishers from 9 Galician communities (Spain), we empirically
   examine the adaptation pathways that fishers follow when they face
   hypothetical impacts on their fishery resources and test the role of
   five social-ecological network structures on fisher's stated intended
   responses to such scenarios. Our results show that fishers generally
   intend to follow a `remain-adapt-transform-exit (the fishery)' pathway
   when faced with increasing climate impacts. Next, we demonstrate that
   trust-based bonding ties and ties to informal leaders are associated
   with a `business-as-usual' strategy. In contrast, communicative bonding
   ties are associated with adaptive responses, while communicative
   bridging ties are associated with transformative and exit strategies.
   Our findings provide key empirical insight that broaden our
   understanding of the intricate relationship between social networks and
   adaptive behaviour relevant to social-ecological systems worldwide.},

Title = {Contribution of Community-Managed Sal-Based Forest in Climate Change
   Adaptation and Mitigation: A Case from Nepal},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Forests are viable tools in combating the impacts of climate change, as
   they are capable of sequestering atmospheric carbon and storing it in
   different pools. This study aimed to examine the carbon sequestration
   potential of community-managed Shorea robusta (Sal) forest and assess
   the practices that have the potential to reduce adverse climate change
   impacts, thereby improving the livelihoods of forest-based communities.
   For this, we obtained forest inventory-derived carbon data from 11
   sample plots of Shorea robusta (Sal) forest, analyzed them using
   allometric equations, and estimated the carbon storage and climate
   change mitigation potential of these forests, while focus group
   discussions and desk review of secondary information were employed to
   investigate the adaptation potential. The results show that the
   estimated biomass density of the selected forest is 352.46 +/- 63.79
   t/ha, whereas the carbon stock density is 165.66 +/- 29.98 t/ha and the
   CO2 equivalent is 598.07 +/- 110.48 t/ha. The study further revealed
   that community forest management, as a successful model of participatory
   forest management and community forest user group (CFUG) as a
   resourceful local institution, has been playing an important role in the
   diversification of livelihoods and income opportunities, social cohesion
   and thus climate change adaptation through collective actions. The
   adaptation and mitigation of climate change impacts have been
   prioritized in the operational plans of the CFUGs. Through the promotion
   and prioritization of alternative energy, agroforestry and enhanced
   livelihood options, the CFUGs are committed to the sustainable
   management of forest resources and to enhancing the livelihoods of local
   communities. This study indicates the relevance of community forests as
   a priority institution for the implementation of Local Adaptation Plans
   for Action (LAPA) and support National Adaptation Program of Action
   (NAPA) to combat climatic impacts, providing important information for
   planners and policy makers in Nepal and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Global change refers to climate changes, but also demographic,
   technological and economic changes. Predicted water scarcity will be
   critical in the coastal Mediterranean region, especially for provision
   to mid-sized and large-sized cities. This paper studies the case of the
   city of Tarragona, located at the Mediterranean area of north-eastern
   Spain (Catalonia). Several scenarios have been constructed to evaluate
   different sectorial water allocation policies to mitigate the water
   scarcity induced by global change. Future water supply and demand
   predictions have been made for three time spans. The decision support
   system presented is based on the outranking model, which constructs a
   partial pre-order based on pairwise preference relations among all the
   possible actions. The system analyses a hierarchical structure of
   criteria, including environmental and economic criteria. We compare
   several adaptation measures including alternative water sources,
   inter-basin water transfer and sectorial demand management coming from
   industry, agriculture and domestic sectors. Results indicate that the
   most appropriate water allocation strategies depend on the severity of
   the global change effects.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {262-266},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate change has been recognised as a major issue for coastal
   populations. Under this context, the potential socio-economic,
   environmental and health impacts at local, regional and global scales
   have received consider. able attention by scientists. The knowledge
   gained feed official strategic documents, which aim to increase
   awareness but also propose and apply management and mitigation measures
   towards reducing risks for human beings and the natural environment.
   Dependencies between human security, social vulnerability of coastal
   communities and the occurrence of maritime crime have also been studied.
   There is a consensus on the need to deepen the understanding of the
   links between climate change effects and threats to maritime security,
   but it remains to be seen if existing knowledge on the interplay between
   climate change and maritime security has been translated into policy.
   This article offers a synthesis on recent evidence and knowledge gained
   to elaborate the nexus between climate change impacts, social
   vulnerabilities and the occurrence of maritime criminality. We further
   explore the extent to which official documents account for the maritime
   dimension of climate change security. Despite the existence of an
   embryonic official discourse linking climate change and maritime
   security, our analysis reveals significant gaps between the concerns
   raised by the academic community and what is acknowledged in national
   and regional official strategic documents. Informing decision-makers and
   stakeholders about the possible dependencies between climate change and
   maritime security is thus a crucial step towards improving global ocean
   governance.},

Title = {Cool pavements for urban heat island mitigation: A synthetic review},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {146},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) effect poses great challenges to urban
   environmental quality, building energy consumption, and public health.
   Over decades, research efforts have been made to develop and evaluate
   different UHI mitigation strategies. Governments, organizations, and
   commercial companies have also been working to develop building codes,
   standards, and green rating systems to improve energy efficiency and
   urban sustainability. However, a lack of synergies between the research
   community, governments, organizations, and commercial companies may
   create knowledge gaps that can become a considerable obstacle to the
   implementation and effectiveness of UHI mitigation strategies. This
   study aims to synthetically review recent research advances, building
   codes and green rating systems, and urban implementation projects
   related to the use of cool pavements for UHI mitigation. In particular,
   we review efforts on reflective pavements, permeable pavements, and
   other innovative pavement strategies. Based on this synthetic review, we
   identify six gaps in existing cool pavement research and five gaps
   related to the implementation of cool pavements in building codes,
   standards, and municipal projects. We further provide recommendations
   and suggestions for each gap. Further efforts are needed to bridge these
   gaps, which will be critical to proactively coping with the negative
   impacts of the UHI effect and promoting more sustainable urban energy
   use.},

Title = {Economic analysis of adaptive strategies for flood risk management under

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Climate change requires reconsideration of flood risk management
   strategies. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA), an economic decision-support
   tool, has been widely applied to assess these strategies. This paper
   aims to describe and discuss probabilistic extensions of CBA to identify
   welfare-maximising flood risk management strategies under climate
   change. First, uncertainty about the changes in return periods of
   hydro-meteorological extremes is introduced by probability-weighted
   climate scenarios. Second, the analysis is extended by learning about
   climate change impacts. Learning occurs upon the probabilistic arrival
   of information. We distinguish between learning from scientific
   progress, from statistical evidence and from flood disasters. These
   probabilistic extensions can be used to analyse and compare the economic
   efficiency and flexibility of flood risk management strategies under
   climate change. We offer a critical discussion of the scope of such
   extensions and options for increasing flexibility. We find that
   uncertainty reduction from scientific progress may reduce initial
   investments, while other types of learning may increase initial
   investments. This requires analysing effects of different types of
   learning. We also find that probabilistic information about climate
   change impacts and learning is imprecise. We conclude that risk-based
   CBA with learning improves the flexibility of flood risk management
   strategies under climate change. However, CBA provides subjective
   estimates of expected outcomes and reflects different decision-maker
   preferences than those captured in robustness analyses. We therefore
   advocate robustness analysis in addition to, or combined with,
   cost-benefit analysis to support local investment decisions on flood
   risk reduction and global strategies on allocation of adaptation funds
   for flood risk management.},

Booktitle = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 11},
Series = {Annual Review of Marine Science},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {307-334},
Abstract = {Scientists have advocated for local interventions, such as creating
   marine protected areas and implementing fishery restrictions, as ways to
   mitigate local stressors to limit the effects of climate change on
   reef-building corals. However, in a literature review, we find little
   empirical support for the notion of managed resilience. We outline some
   reasons for why marine protected areas and the protection of herbivorous
   fish (especially parrotfish) have had little effect on coral resilience.
   One key explanation is that the impacts of local stressors (e.g.,
   pollution and fishing) are often swamped by the much greater effect of
   ocean warming on corals. Another is the sheer complexity (including
   numerous context dependencies) of the five cascading links assumed by
   the managed-resilience hypothesis. If reefs cannot be saved by local
   actions alone, then it is time to face reef degradation head-on, by
   directly addressing anthropogenic climate change-the root cause of
   global coral decline.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The Paris Agreement signed by 195 countries in 2015 sets out a global
   action plan to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming
   to remain below 2 degrees C. Under that premise, in situ experiments
   were run to test the effects of 2 degrees C temperature increase on the
   benthic communities in a seagrass bed and adjacent bare sediment, from a
   temperate European estuary. Temperature was artificially increased in
   situ and diversity and ecosystem functioning components measured after
   10 and 30 days. Despite some warmness effects on the analysed
   components, significant impacts were not verified on macro and
   microfauna structure, bioturbation or in the fluxes of nutrients. The
   effect of site/ habitat seemed more important than the effects of the
   warmness, with the seagrass habitat providing more homogenous results
   and being less impacted by warmness than the adjacent bare sediment. The
   results reinforce that most ecological responses to global changes are
   context dependent and that ecosystem stability depends not only on
   biological diversity but also on the availability of different habitats
   and niches, highlighting the role of coastal wetlands. In the context of
   the Paris Agreement it seems that estuarine benthic ecosystems will be
   able to cope if global warming remains below 2 degrees C.},

Abstract = {South Florida's water and environmental resources are already under
   pressure from socio-economic growth and declining ecosystems. The region
   has one of the world's largest systems of canals, levees and water
   control structures to manage water resources under extreme drought and
   flood conditions. Emerging challenges such as sea level rise and climate
   change increase the need for adaptive water resources management
   strategies to sustain human and natural systems in the region.
   Understanding the tradeoffs of integrated water resources management
   within this unique, multi-purpose water resources system under existing
   and projected conditions is key for developing effective adaptation
   strategies. We apply a hydro-economic model to investigate the tradeoffs
   associated with reliable water supply for urban and agricultural
   sectors, while maintaining fragile ecosystems and protecting
   metropolitan areas against flooding. Furthermore, we explore climate
   change impacts on the system-wide tradeoffs by running the
   hydro-economic optimization model under a set of climate change and sea
   level rise scenarios. Results illustrate implications of potential
   climatic changes on integrated water resources management in south
   Florida, providing insights for infrastructure investments that will be
   needed to maintain current levels of service.},

Title = {A study on hot-water production of hotels in Cyprus: Energy and
   environmental considerations},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {150},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Hotel units are responsible for a significant proportion of energy
   consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the tourist sector. This
   paper focuses on the energy and environmental performance of hot-water
   production systems utilized by high class hotels in Cyprus in order to
   formulate appropriate carbon emission mitigation strategies. The main
   systems used are boilers fired by Liquefied Petroleum Gas or Diesel oil,
   air-source heat pumps and flat plate solar collectors. The results show
   that the combination of air-source heat pumps with flat plate solar
   collectors leads to the lowest primary energy consumption. Therefore,
   improving the sustainability of the tourism sector in Cyprus requires to
   phase out the usage of boiler systems that are currently in use in
   almost all four star and five star hotels and promote the use of solar
   thermal systems in combination with air-source heat pumps. These
   findings are relevant for island states and other popular tourist
   destinations sharing similar characteristics with those of Cyprus and
   provide a framework for national authorities to plan an appropriate
   energy and environmental upgrade of the hotel stock. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {More than information: what coastal managers need to plan for climate
   change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {315-328},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) increasingly threaten the
   world's coastlines, managers at local, regional, state, and federal
   levels will need to plan and implement adaptation measures to cope with
   these impacts in order to continue to protect the economic, social, and
   environmental security of the state and of local communities.
   In this paper, we explore the information needs of California coastal
   managers as they begin confronting the growing risks from climate
   change. Through this case study we examine the challenges managers face
   presently, what information they use to perform their responsibilities,
   what additional information and other knowledge resources they may need
   to begin planning for climate change. We place our study into the
   broader context of the study of how science can best support
   policy-makers and resource managers as they begin to plan and prepare
   for adaptation to climate change.
   Based on extensive interview and survey research in the state, we find
   that managers prefer certain types of information and information
   sources and would benefit from various learning opportunities (in
   addition to that information) to make better use of available global
   change information. Coastal managers are concerned about climate change
   and willing to address it in their work, but require financial and
   technical assistance from other agencies at the state and federal level
   to do so. The study illustrates the strong need for boundary
   organizations to serve various intermediary functions between science
   and practice, especially in the context of adaptation to global climate
   change impacts. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Trends and Impacts of Climate Change in Cameroon, Central Africa:
   Considerations for Renewed Ethics towards Resilience Options for the
   Community},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {255-266},
Abstract = {Cameroon, a country situated in Central Africa, is endowed with varied
   ecological diversity that ranges from coastal mangroves and rich
   Equatorial rainforests in the south, through Savannah and Sahel
   ecosystems, to the southern fringes of the Sahara desert around Lake
   Chad in the north. It could accordingly be considered more or less as
   representative of Africa in miniature. An evaluation of parameters
   associated with climate change and its impacts in the country based on
   existing data on the subject during the last century (1926 to 2007) is
   indicative of increasing trends with national magnitudes similar to
   those of global trends. Regional trends of climate change across the
   country are assessed, their impacts on vulnerable communities evaluated,
   and possible mitigation and adaptation approaches discussed with
   specific reference to ongoing research and outreach activities. Recent
   proactive government policy and action to create a national observatory
   for climate change in the country is presented. The status, mission,
   composition, and anticipated activities of such an observatory are
   discussed with the aim of ensuring its scientific rationale, as well as
   the social, economic, ethical, and cultural implications of decisions to
   be considered by the government in its policy towards redressing issues
   on climate change through such an observatory. Discussions of some
   ongoing policies, capacity building, and sensitization experiences at
   the national and international levels, especially on the African
   continent, are used to highlight the advantages and pitfalls to be
   considered when providing the most optimal approaches of tackling this
   human suicidal phenomenon, which is already decimating humankind and
   other species on the Earth's surface at an alarming rate. Renewed
   environmental and political ethics on the subject are proposed for
   future consideration.},

Volume = {5},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Globally, fisheries catch of non-target species has major environmental
   impacts, resulting in social conflict, litigation, and fisheries
   closures. We use a bio-economic approach to demonstrate that
   compensatory mitigation - an innovative, market-influenced approach to
   fishery-conservation conflicts - can facilitate high-value uses of
   biological resources and cost-effective conservation gains for species
   of concern. We illustrate the strategy with a seabird example: levying
   fishers for their bycatch and using the funds to remove invasive mammals
   from breeding islands. Removal of invasive predators is 23 times more
   effective from a return-on-investment perspective (ie percent increase
   in population growth per dollar invested) in comparison to fisheries
   closures, and is more socio-politically feasible. A bycatch levy, which
   would increase with endangerment, provides an individual incentive for
   avoiding bycatch, the most effective mechanism for sustainable
   management of fisheries. Compensatory mitigation provides an opportunity
   to address a global concern, optimize conservation interventions, and
   forge an alliance between conservation and fisheries organizations.},

   Strategies: A Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coastal area constitutes a vulnerable environment and requires special
   attention to preserve ecosystems and human activities therein. To this
   aim, many studies have been devoted both in past and recent years to
   analyzing the main factors affecting coastal vulnerability and
   susceptibility. Among the most used approaches, the Coastal
   Vulnerability Index (CVI) accounts for all relevant variables that
   characterize the coastal environment dealing with: (i) forcing actions
   (waves, tidal range, sea-level rise, etc.), (ii) morphological
   characteristics (geomorphology, foreshore slope, dune features, etc.),
   (iii) socio-economic, ecological and cultural aspects (tourism
   activities, natural habitats, etc.). Each variable is evaluated at each
   portion of the investigated coast, and associated with a vulnerability
   level which usually ranges from 1 (very low vulnerability), to 5 (very
   high vulnerability). Following a susceptibility/vulnerability analysis
   of a coastal stretch, specific strategies must be chosen and implemented
   to favor coastal resilience and adaptation, spanning from hard solutions
   (e.g., groins, breakwaters, etc.) to soft solutions (e.g., beach and
   dune nourishment projects), to the relocation option and the
   establishment of accommodation strategies (e.g., emergency
   preparedness).},

Title = {Adaptive comanagement in developing world contexts: A systematic review
   of adaptive comanagement in Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {64-77},
Abstract = {Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) province, Indonesia is beset by high
   vulnerability to climate change and weak adaptive capacity to address
   its effects. Livelihoods in the province are intimately tied to
   increasingly scarce and contested ecosystem goods and services. The
   population's climate vulnerability is further exacerbated by social,
   economic, and cultural drivers of vulnerability, such as rapid
   population growth, pervasive corruption, and inadequate community
   participation in planning processes. Scholars and practitioners have
   begun conceptualizing and implementing adaptive comanagement (ACM)
   approaches in NTB. ACM is an environmental governance approach for
   complex, multi-scale social-ecological systems facing uncertainty and
   rapid system changes. ACM aims to forge vertical and horizontal links
   for shared learning between the various actors of multi-level resource
   management systems. The province's markedly heterogeneous physical and
   social geographies present a unique opportunity to glean lessons
   applicable to a range of contexts including rural communities, island
   geographies, the Indonesian archipelago, the tropical Asia-Pacific
   region, and the developing world more broadly. This paper provides a
   systematic review of efforts to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate
   adaptive comanagement approaches in Nusa Tenggara Barat. In doing so, it
   characterizes the literature, discerns salient thematic components, and
   identifies areas for further research and action on the
   conceptualization and implementation of adaptive comanagement. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Many studies have shown that a comprehensive plan with sufficient
   mitigation elements can significantly reduce natural disaster impact.
   However, they often neglect the need to match the implementation of
   mitigation measures to the local conditions because the ability to cope
   with impacts from a severe disaster varies by socioeconomic group.
   Therefore, it is extremely important to identify who and what are more
   exposed to a natural hazard and design adequate mitigation measures
   accordingly. This study aims to (1) identify seismic and
   climate-change-induced (sea-level rising and wildfire) hazardous
   locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, and (2) examine whether all
   neighborhoods, in four dimensions (economic, social, land use, and
   capital investment), are equally exposed to each natural hazard at three
   spatial scales (county, region, the Bay) over two time periods
   (2020-2060, 2060-2099). Methodologically, the study region and its
   sub-regions were divided into hazard and non-hazard zones with a defined
   hazard level for three natural hazards. Vulnerability variables in the
   four dimensions were collected at the census tract level. A two-sample
   t-test was then conducted to examine whether each vulnerability variable
   was significantly different between the two zones (hazard and
   non-hazard) for a specific natural hazard at a specific spatial scale in
   a specific time period. The findings reveal where, who, and what are
   exposed to different natural hazards. Corresponding mitigation measures
   for local governments are suggested. The results also highlight whether
   the spatial pattern of each hazard changes over time and whether local
   governments should work on mitigation alone, cooperate with other
   counties, or act together.},

Abstract = {Planet Earth has recently witnessed a change in the behavior of climate
   variables (including temperature, rainfall, etc.), primarily attributed
   to global warming. This climate change is a threat that is materializing
   and has affected elements of the infrastructure, ecosystems, and
   environmental conditions worldwide, as well as the National Development
   Plans {[}{''}Planes Nacionales de Desarrollo{''}].
   The hydrocarbon-transport infrastructure in Colombia has not escaped the
   effects of climate variability. Therefore, a strategy must be devised to
   manage the risk and to adapt these systems in the light of potential
   harmful effects, and also to supplement or improve the mitigation
   measures for the effects generated by the oil industry through its
   operations.
   Climate disturbances lead to an increase in the likelihood of
   landslides, wildfires, floods, avalanches, and other natural hazards.
   The major climate changes that have been identified and that may affect
   hydrocarbon-transfer systems in Colombia are the following ones:
   A gradual increase in temperature. Changes in the patterns and amounts
   of rainfall.
   A rise in sea level.
   An increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events.
   The strategy for adapting the hydrocarbon-transport systems in light of
   climate change focuses primarily on the following points:
   1. Acquiring more knowledge about the climatic changes that are expected
   to occur in Colombia, including the change in the major climatic
   variables and their georeferencing.
   2. Diagnosing the transport systems and their spatial correlation with
   future climate scenarios.
   3. Identifying the industries or elements of the infrastructure that are
   most vulnerable to the expected climatic changes.
   4. Proposing measures that will add strength and/or resilience, so that
   the elements of the system can resist the effects of climate change, or
   overcome them within a short period of time, without affecting the
   Business.
   5. Prioritizing the interventions to be performed at sites that are
   critical to the Business.
   6. Monitoring and tracking the climatic variables in order to adjust the
   susceptibility models in light of the major impacts (e.g., landslides).
   The primary goal of this paper is to outline the initiative that has
   been proposed by the Technical Asset Management Bureau {[}{''}Gerencia
   Tecnica de Activos{''}] (GTA) of Ecopetrol's Office of the Vice
   President for Transportation and Logistics {[}{''}Vicepresidencia de
   Transporte y Logistica{''}] (VIT Ecopetrol) in order to adapt the
   currently operating transport systems so that they can deal with climate
   change, while ensuring their healthful and safe operation, in compliance},

Title = {Everyday Adaptation: Theorizing climate change adaptation in daily life},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate science to date demonstrates that natural and human systems must
   urgently adapt. Adaptation refers to changes in societies and ecological
   systems as they respond to both actual and anticipated impacts of the
   changing climate. While adaptation is not limited to the level of
   planning and policy, existing adaptation practice privileges
   institutional action. We argue that the definition of adaptation should
   be broadened to include the small, incremental changes made in our daily
   lives to accommodate the shifting ecologies in which we live. Drawing on
   critical adaptation research and our own ethnographic fieldwork in the
   Global South, we define everyday adaptation as the shifted ways a person
   works, eats, lives and thinks in response to climate realities, rather
   than the hardening of coastlines or the relocation of vulnerable
   structures. We integrate and build on existing scholarship on adaptation
   and the everyday to theorize the logics of everyday, hyperlocal
   adaptation. This hyperlocal scale is a critical component of any
   definition of adaptation and a useful lens for studying the way much of
   the global population adapts and will continue to adapt their lives to
   climate change. We offer two theoretical components of adaptation
   revealed by the everyday - adaptation labor and value adaptation - as
   lenses to see changes in everyday action. Through considering hyperlocal
   action, we then identify and explore four logics of everyday adaptation
   actions: lifestyle stability, socio-ecological reactivity, livelihood
   flexibility, and community capacity. Everyday adaptations are limited by
   individuals' capacity to adapt and thereby determine the longevity,
   livability, and quality of life of places on the frontlines of climate
   change. We argue for understanding the aggregate effects of everyday
   adaptation in order to better align the actions of those living with
   climate change in their everyday lives and the large-scale adaptation
   projects aiming to protect them.},

Abstract = {The South Australian planning regime considers the anticipated coastal
   impacts of climate change (increased storm surge, coastal erosion and
   sea level rise) to be a serious threat to the State's natural and urban
   environments. It adopts the notions of ecologically sustainable
   development (ESD) and the precautionary principle by accepting climate
   change as a certain phenomenon and facilitating the implementation of
   adaptive and protective measures. However, the regime limits the
   availability of these measures to new developments. It is argued that
   this ``narrow{''} approach to adaptation reflects the balancing of
   competing factors consistent with ESD and recognises the practical
   challenges of implementing a comprehensive policy response in light of
   resourcing, potential risks and liabilities, the dearth of evidence and
   climate change perceptions. Moreover, it represents a reasonable
   governmental response to coastal climate change which influences the
   potential civil liability of local and State governments for future
   climate change-based harm.},

Abstract = {Global climate change is an important cause of biodiversity loss. The
   conservation, sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources
   are key factors that can be effectively used to minimize the adverse
   impacts of global climate change. Efforts to understand and address the
   linkages between global climate change and biodiversity loss are both
   urgent and timely.
   Integrating responses related to these two global environmental
   challenges is especially relevant for small island developing States
   (SIDS) because the adverse impacts of climate change can impose severe
   stresses on biodiversity resources that are fragile, vulnerable and
   already under stress and the people who depend upon them. This paper
   argues that comprehensive assessments of adverse impacts of global
   climate change on the biodiversity resources of SIDS, and an improved
   understanding of relevant climate change related adaptation measures and
   sustainable energy policies (that are based on the principles of
   conservation, sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources)
   will enable SIDS to become more resilient and to develop better response
   capacities.},

Title = {Cultural dimensions of risk perceptions: A case study on cross-strait
   driftage pollution in a coastal area of Taiwan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {206},
Pages = {123-133},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Constant exploitations of the ocean render numerous present challenges
   as the ocean is linked to human development. The study focused on
   cross-strait driftage pollution that poses a great threat to coastal
   environment under climate change. Several hundred packs of herbicides
   drifting across the Taiwan Strait were discovered along the coastline of
   Guanyin District of Taiwan. We compared risk perceptions of the local
   ethnic groups, Hakka and Fulao, residing in a coastal area of Taiwan and
   exposed to the herbicide coastal incident under climate change. It is of
   concern that society's response to every dimension of global climate
   change is mediated by culture. The Driver Pressure State Impact Response
   (DPSIR) cause-effect framework was applied in semi-structured interviews
   to explore coastal sensitivity and human adaptability. As a result, we
   indicated that despite the presence of two ethnic groups in the same
   place exposed to the incident they presented very different risk
   perceptions on both environmental degradation (ED) and adaptive capacity
   (AC) due to cultural values. We argued that the herbicide coastal
   incident involved people's risk perceptions and subsequently influenced
   their opinions and attitudes towards environmental problems. We
   concluded that the ethnic trait contributed to adaptive behaviors during
   environmental change. Culturally appropriate adaptations appeared to
   enhance risk perceptions and adaptation actions, suggesting a need for
   more rigorous cultural adaptation guidelines towards climate resilience
   when designing adaptation interventions for different ethnic groups. (C)

Title = {Integration of Ecosystem Services in Strategic Environmental Assessment
   of a Peri-Urban Development Plan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) can support decision-makers in
   constructing more sustainable plans, programs, and policies (PPPs). To
   be more coherent with new frontiers of sustainable cities, PPPs need to
   include conservation objectives and to increase ecosystem service (ES)
   strategies. The ES concept is not intrinsic to the SEA process;
   therefore, it is necessary to develop an approach and methodology to
   include it. In this paper, we propose a methodology to integrate the
   concept of ecosystem services in all phases of the SEA process for a
   sub-urban plan, including the design of mitigation measures. The case
   study is represented by a peri-urban development plan in the
   municipality of Gallipoli in South Italy, characterized by a strong
   tourism economy and valuable agro-ecosystems. The analysis shows the
   priority ecosystem services that are selected considering the
   sustainable development and environmental goals, the context of
   referment, and the aims of the peri-urban plan. After, we highlight the
   potential ecosystem services developed considering the design of
   mitigation actions like green infrastructure, which could be implemented
   in the peri-urban plan. The capacity to develop green infrastructure in
   SEA processes can configure the SEA as a tool for ecological urban
   design that is integrated with urban planning. This requires the ability
   to transfer ecological and planning theories into practical actions and
   the capacity of different disciplines to work in a transdisciplinary
   approach.},

Title = {The Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Urban Heat Island Intensity:
   Implications for East Africa's Urban Development},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to the combination of climate change and the rapid growth in urban
   populations in Africa, many urban areas are encountering exacerbated
   urban heat island (UHI) effects. It is important to understand UHI
   effects in order to develop suitable adaptation and mitigation
   strategies. However, little work has been done in this regard in Africa.
   In this study, we compared surface UHI (SUHI) effects between cities
   located in different climate zones in East Africa, investigating how
   they change, both spatially and temporally. We quantified the annual
   daytime and night-time SUHI intensities in the five most populated
   cities in East Africa in 2003 and 2017, and investigated the links to
   urban area size. We consider the possible drivers of SUHI change and
   consider the implication for future development, highlighting the role
   of factors such as topography and building/construction materials. We
   suggest that UHI mitigation strategies targeting East African cities may
   benefit from more comprehensive analyses of blue and green
   infrastructure as this offers potential opportunities to enhance human
   comfort in areas where UHI effects are highest. However, this needs
   careful planning to avoid increasing associated issues such as disease
   risks linked to a changing climate.},

Abstract = {The former environmental context and current visitors' perception of the
   Roman Shore Forts in South-East England belonging to the so-called
   ``Saxon Shore{''} (i.e. the Litus Saxonicum firstly mentioned in the
   Notitia Dignitatum, late 4th century AD) were drastically altered by
   centuries of sea-level rise and siltation phases due to past climate
   changes, and correlated coastal erosion and landsliding processes.
   Further threat for conservation is reasonably to be expected as a
   consequence of the near future climate change scenarios drawn for the
   UK. In this paper we analyze coastal and inland geohazards and
   consequent geotechnical instability which chronically affect the Roman
   Shore Forts, as well as the issues related to the implementation of
   protection schemes. The current land-locked configuration of sites like
   Richborough in Kent and Pevensey in East Sussex, makes them relatively
   or totally secure. Conversely, the direct and persistent exposure to
   coastal dynamics is a pressing issue for the conservation of the
   archaeological structures in Portchester, Hampshire and Reculver, North
   Kent. These sites clearly exemplify the current need of planning
   targeted conservation initiatives in the framework of an established and
   shared procedure of coastal risk management. They are assumed here among
   the demonstrative cases to critically discuss the impacts of climate
   change and ever-changing coastal environment on the choice of
   site-specific mitigation/adaptation strategies.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {9},
Pages = {4095-4106},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change has far-reaching impacts on ecosystems. Recent attempts
   to quantify such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climate change
   but largely ignore ecosystem resistance and resilience, which may also
   affect the vulnerability outcomes. In this study, the relative
   vulnerability of global terrestrial ecosystems to short-term climate
   variability was assessed by simultaneously integrating exposure,
   sensitivity, and resilience at a high spatial resolution (0.05 degrees).
   The results show that vulnerable areas are currently distributed
   primarily in plains. Responses to climate change vary among ecosystems
   and deserts and xeric shrublands are the most vulnerable biomes. Global
   vulnerability patterns are determined largely by exposure, while
   ecosystem sensitivity and resilience may exacerbate or alleviate
   external climate pressures at local scales; there is a highly
   significant negative correlation between exposure and sensitivity.
   Globally, 61.31\% of the terrestrial vegetated area is capable of
   mitigating climate change impacts and those areas are concentrated in
   polar regions, boreal forests, tropical rainforests, and intact forests.
   Under current sensitivity and resilience conditions, vulnerable areas
   are projected to develop in high Northern Hemisphere latitudes in the
   future. The results suggest that integrating all three aspects of
   vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and resilience) may offer more
   comprehensive and spatially explicit adaptation strategies to reduce the
   impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.},

   Increase of minimum and maximum temperature and average rainfall are
   evident in this country along with the future projection regarding
   increase of temperature and precipitation. As a result sea level will
   rise and flood events will frequently occur in the future. The
   intensity, severity and extent of flooding will also be higher in the
   near future. It is evident that the negative impacts of extreme events
   will bring difficulties and challenges for people living in vulnerable

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Shifting environmental conditions resulting from anthropogenic climate
   change have recently garnered much attention in the aquaculture
   industry; however, ocean acidification has received relatively little
   attention. Here, we provide an overview of ocean acidification in the
   context of North American aquaculture with respect to potential impacts
   and mitigation strategies. North American shellfish farms should make
   ocean acidification an immediate priority, as shellfish and other
   calcifying organisms are of highest concern in an increasingly
   acidifying ocean and negative effects have already been felt on the
   Pacific coast. While implications for various finfish have been
   documented, our current understanding of how acidification will impact
   North American finfish aquaculture is limited and requires more
   research. Although likely to benefit from increases in seawater CO2,
   some seaweeds may also be at risk under more acidic conditions,
   particularly calcifying species, as well as non-calcifying ones residing
   in areas where CO2 is not the primary driver of acidification.
   Strategies to mitigate and adapt to the effects of acidification exist
   on the regional scale and can aid in identifying areas of concern,
   detecting changes in seawater carbonate chemistry early enough to avoid
   catastrophic outcomes, and adapting to long-term shifts in oceanic pH.
   Ultimately, ocean acidification has already imposed negative impacts on
   the aquaculture industry, but can be addressed with sufficient
   monitoring and the establishment of regional mitigation plans.},

Abstract = {This text aims to show that in addition to the uncertainties concerning
   the impacts of climate change, another major source of uncertainty must
   also be considered: that which arises from the evolution of tourist
   requirements and their attitudes towards coastal practices.
   Nevertheless, we argue that these uncertainties cannot be an excuse to
   wait for more precise scientific knowledge to emerge and that a number
   of principles for adaptation can be highlighted.},

Abstract = {Climate change on the planet is irreversibly affecting all continents to
   a greater or lesser extent. Consequently, populations settled in rural,
   urban and coastal areas must undergo an inevitable adaptation process
   due to the risks and vulnerabilities that prevail in each region.
   However, adaptation opportunities in coastal zones are shaped by social,
   economic and environmental problems that influence local adaptation
   capacity. In this research, the analyzed case study comprises the
   communities located along the Rio Lagartos Biosphere Reserve, in
   Yucatan, Mexico, where habitability conditions have been seriously
   threatened by climate change affecting local dwellings, the natural
   landscape, urban equipment and infrastructure, among others. As a result
   of this research, the effects of such threats were identified and
   sustainable development indicators are suggested as part of a more
   integral approach for policy makers to promote adaptation and reinforce
   the habitability conditions of coastal, rural and urban areas. The
   incorporation of strategies for optimizing resources to make local
   livelihoods more efficient and sustainable should be part of such policy
   agenda.},

Title = {Evaluation of flexibility in adaptation projects for climate change},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1-2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation inherently entails investment decision-making
   under the high levels of uncertainty. To address this issue, a single
   fixed large investment can be divided into two or more sequential
   investments. This reduces the initial investment cost and adds
   flexibility about the size and timing of subsequent investment
   decisions. This flexibility enables future investment decisions to be
   made when further information about the magnitude of climate change
   becomes available. This paper presents a real option analysis framework
   to evaluate adaptations including flexibility to reduce both the risk
   and uncertainty of climate change, against increasing coastal flooding
   due to sea-level rise as an example. The paper considers (i) how to
   design the sequence of adaptation options under growing risk of
   sea-level rise, and (ii) how to make the efficient use of flexibility
   included in adaptations for addressing uncertainty. A set of
   flexibilities (i.e. wait or future growth) are incorporated into
   single-stage investments (i.e. raising coastal defence from 2.5 mAOD to
   3.5mAOD or 4.0 mAOD) in stages so that multiple-stage adaptations with
   different heights are created. The proposed method compares these
   sequentially growing adaptations in economic terms, including
   optimisation, providing additional information on the efficiency of
   flexible adaptation strategies given the uncertainty of climate change.
   The results from the evaluation enable decision-makers to identify
   long-lasting robust adaptation against the uncertainty of climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Construction using timber has seen a resurgence in light of global
   climate mitigation policies. Wood is a renewable resource, and
   engineered wood products are proving to be competitive against concrete
   and steel while having several advantages. However, while the renewable
   nature of wood in construction is a beneficial property for climate
   mitigation policies, the process of biodegradation introduces a
   challenge for service life planning. A review of hazard mapping is
   presented while developing contemporary hazard maps, occurrence maps and
   projected hazard maps for 2050 using representative concentration
   pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. The risk of timber decay is expected to
   increase in most of Europe as the temperatures rise, with a decrease
   expected in dryer regions. Termites are likely to experience a range
   expansion as more areas become suitable, while human activity and an
   increase in extreme weather events like floods are expected to
   facilitate dispersion. Marine borer species already present a risk in
   most European coastal regions; however, the effect of changes in water
   temperatures are likely to shift the boundaries for individual borer
   species. Overall, warmer climates are expected to increase the metabolic
   activity of all of these organisms leading to a general reduction in
   service life.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {182},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In a context of growing concern about climate change and its potential
   consequences for coastal systems, adaptation is becoming more important
   than ever before. This paper presents a national planning framework for
   adaptation to climate change, which is pioneer in the field as it is
   multi-sectoral and focuses specifically on coastal areas, pursuing the
   safety of their communities in an uncertain future. The strategy is
   statutory as it emanates from the new Spanish Coastal Law, which in
   addition to many other implications includes the compulsory development
   of a Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change (SSCACC)
   and its submission to Strategic Environmental Assessment. This paper
   covers the fundamental aspects of both the SSCACC and the accompanying
   Strategic Environmental Study, providing recommendations on the
   assessment of coastal risks triggered by climate change and extreme
   events, adaptation and risk reduction planning and implementation, and
   monitoring. Additionally, this work gives insight into the wide-ranging
   consultation process carried out prior to the SSCACC's approval and the
   stakeholders involved, and how the SSCACC handles climate change
   uncertainty and struggles for overcoming barriers.},

Series = {Coastal Research Library},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Pages = {213-231},
Abstract = {Climate change is occurring and its potential impacts pose manifold
   risks for the Baltic Sea Region. Due to their exposure, coastal urban
   regions are highly vulnerable to possible effects of climate change,
   like for instance sea level rise, floods or extreme weather events.
   Also, the urban regions are characterized by complex and manifold
   internal and external interplays and pressures for spatial development.
   In the first part, the article presents the particular conditions of
   coastal urban regions as well as the relevance of urban and regional
   planning in adapting to climate change. The second part refers to two
   selected urban regions of the Baltic Sea Region (Stockholm and
   Copenhagen) and their approaches of adaptation to climate change
   impacts, based on a documentary analysis. The third part presents an
   orientation for adaptation strategies from the urban and regional
   planning perspective. This includes the suggestion of comprehensive
   approaches with the integration of sectoral planning, of a regional
   focus as well as of an iterative and flexible planning. More
   specifically are proposed to tackle the following fields of activity:
   building aspects, open spaces, infrastructure and services and complex

Abstract = {Community-based adaptation (CBA) seeks to address climate risks and
   socio-economic drivers of vulnerability simultaneously. However, as CBA
   activities appear very similar to standard development work,
   difficulties in identifying good practices arise. To clarify the role of
   CBA, this study elucidated how climate change can impact pre-existing
   development problems by investigating the experiences of four low-lying
   island communities in central Philippines. The islands currently suffer
   from frequent and extreme tidal flooding (following an
   earthquake-induced land subsidence in 2013, with a magnitude that is
   broadly similar to sea-level rise projections under a 1.5 to 2 degrees C
   global warming scenario), and endured a dry spell in 2016. The study
   also identified various publicly and privately initiated adaptation
   strategies, and evaluated their resilience against actual biophysical
   events. The study conducted focus group discussions with local leaders
   and in-depth interviews with government officials and residents in March
   2016. Results show that tidal flooding impacted almost all aspects of
   daily life on the islands, while the dry spell completely depleted their
   limited water supplies. The strategies implemented by governments and
   NGOs (e.g., seawalls, rainwater collectors) were found to be inadequate
   in preventing tidal flooding and compensating for the dry spell. Also,
   communities used coral stones and plastic waste for raising the floors

Abstract = {Coastal planners' expectations of climate change play an important role
   in their assessment of potential risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation
   strategies. This paper assesses coastal planners' expectations of
   climate change and compares their estimates to widely referenced climate
   science projections. It focuses on assessing expectations of the
   magnitude and uncertainty of global temperature and sea-level change by
   2030 and the likelihood of four climate change impacts by the
   mid-to-late twenty-first century. A web-based questionnaire (n=137) was
   used to elicit coastal planner expectations of climate change in three
   coastal states (Alaska, Florida, and Maryland) across three levels of
   management (local, state, and non-government organizations). Findings
   indicate that over half of the planners were unsure of the magnitude of
   global temperature and sea-level rise (SLR). Among those who responded,
   planner estimates of the magnitude and uncertainty of global temperature
   and SLR are higher than climate science projections reviewed in this
   research. Roughly 80\% of all participants believed that each of the
   four climate impacts were at least more likely than not' to occur. We
   discuss the consequences of these expectations for how climate risk,
   vulnerability, and adaptation are managed and suggest pathways for
   aligning expectations and facilitating adaptation.},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts on the regional hydrological cycle are compared
   for model projections following an ambitious emissions-reduction
   scenario (E1) and a medium-high emissions scenario with no mitigation
   policy (A1B). The E1 scenario is designed to limit global annual mean
   warming to 2 A degrees C or less above pre-industrial levels. A
   multi-model ensemble consisting of ten coupled atmosphere-ocean general
   circulation models is analyzed, which includes five Earth System Models
   containing interactive carbon cycles. The aim of the study is to assess
   the changes that could be mitigated under the E1 scenario and to
   identify regions where even small climate change may lead to strong
   changes in precipitation, cloud cover and evapotranspiration. In these
   regions the hydrological cycle is considered particularly vulnerable to
   climate change, highlighting the need for adaptation measures even if
   strong mitigation of climate change would be achieved. In the A1B
   projections, there are significant drying trends in sub-tropical
   regions, precipitation increases in high latitudes and some monsoon
   regions, as well as changes in cloudiness and evapotranspiration. These
   signals are reduced in E1 scenario projections. However, even under the
   E1 scenario, significant precipitation decrease in the subtropics and
   increase in high latitudes are projected. Particularly the Amazon region
   shows strong drying tendencies in some models, most probably related to
   vegetation interaction. Where climate change is relatively small, the E1
   scenario tends to keep the average magnitude of potential changes at a
   level comparable to current intra-seasonal to inter-annual variability
   at that location. Such regions are mainly located in the mid-latitudes.},

Title = {A climate adaptation strategy for Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site:
   Steppingstone to climate proofing the East Asian-Australasian Flyway},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {The ecological functionality of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is
   threatened by the loss of wetlands which provide staging and wintering
   sites for migrating waterbirds. The disappearance of wetland ecosystems
   due to coastal development prevents birds from completing their
   migrations, resulting in population declines, and even an eventual
   collapse of the migration phenomenon. Coastal wetlands are also under
   threat from global climate change and its consequences, notably sea
   level rise (SLR), extreme storm events, and accompanying wave and tidal
   surges. The impacts of SLR are compounded by coastal subsidence and
   decreasing sedimentation, which can result from coastal development.
   Thus, important wetlands along the flyway should be assessed for the
   impacts of climate change and coastal subsidence to plan and implement
   proactive climate adaptation strategies that include habitat migration
   and possibility of coastal squeeze. We modelled the impacts of climate
   change and decreasing sedimentation rates on important bird habitats in
   the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site to support a climate adaptation
   strategy that will continue to host migratory birds. Located in the
   Inner Deep Bay of the Pearl River estuary, Mai Po's tidal flats, coastal
   mangroves, marshes, and fishponds provide habitat for over 80,000
   wintering and passage waterbirds. We applied the Sea Level Affecting
   Marshes Model (SLAMM) to simulate habitat conversion under two SLR
   scenarios (1.5m and 2.0m) for 2050, 2075, and 2100 for four accretion
   rates (2mm/yr, 4 mm/yr, 8 mm/yr, 15 mm/yr). The results showed no
   discernible impact to habitats until after 2075, but projections for
   2100 show that the mangroves, marshes and tidal flats could be impacted
   in almost all scenarios of SLR and accretion. Under a 1.5m SLR scenario,
   even at low tide, if accretion levels decrease to 4 mm/yr, the tidal
   flats will be inundated and with a 2 mm/yr accretion the mangroves will
   also be inundated. Thus, important shorebird habitats will be lost.
   During high tide the ponds inside the nature reserve, which are
   intensively managed to provide high tide roosting sites and other
   habitats for waterbirds, will also be inundated. Thus, with a 1.5m SLR
   and declining sedimentation the migratory shorebirds will lose habitat,
   including the high tide roosting habitats inside the nature reserve. The
   model also indicates that the fishponds further inland in the Ramsar
   site will be less impacted. Most fishponds are privately owned and could
   be developed in the future, including into high rise apartments; thus,
   securing them for conservation should be an important climate change
   adaptation strategy for Mai Po, since they provide essential habitats
   for birds under future climate change scenarios. But Mai Po is only one
   steppingstone along the EAAF, and hundreds of other wetlands are also
   threatened by encroaching infrastructure and climate change. Thus,
   similar analyses for the other wetlands are recommended to develop a
   flyway-wide climate-adaptation conservation strategy before available
   options become lost to wetland conversion.},

Title = {Development and analysis of a long-term soil moisture data set in three
   different agroclimatic zones of South Africa},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {117},
Number = {5-6},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding the potential impacts of climate variability/change on
   soil moisture is essential for the development of informed adaptation
   strategies. However, long-term in-situ soil moisture measurements are
   sparse in most countries. The objectives of this study were to develop
   and analyse the temporal variability of a long-term soil moisture data
   set in South Africa. In this study, a water balance model was used to
   reconstruct long-term soil moisture data sets from 1980 through 2018, in
   three sites that represent the diverse agroclimatic conditions of South
   Africa. Additionally, long-term changes and variability of soil moisture
   were examined to investigate the potential impacts of climate
   variability on soil moisture. The results of the Mann-Kendall test
   showed a non-significant decreasing trend of soil moisture for inland
   stations at a rate between -0.001 and -0.02 mm per annum. In contrast, a
   statistically significant (at 5\% level of significance) increasing
   trend of soil moisture for a coastal station at a rate of 0.1131 mm per
   annum was observed. The findings suggest that the Bainsvlei and
   Bronkhorstspruit stations located in the inland region are gradually
   becoming drier as a result of decreasing rainfall and increasing air
   temperature. In contrast, the Mandeni station located in the coastal
   region is becoming wetter as a result of increasing rainfall, despite
   the increase in air temperature. The findings indicate that climate
   variability is likely to change the soil moisture content, although the
   influence will vary with region and climatic conditions. Therefore,
   understanding the factors that affect soil moisture variability at the
   local scale is critical for the development of informed and effective
   adaptation strategies.
   Significance:
   Long-term modelled estimates were used to investigate the potential
   impacts of climate variability on soil moisture in three different
   agroclimatic conditions of South Africa.
   Results show that inland regions are gradually becoming drier as a
   result of decreasing trends of rainfall and increasing air temperatures
   while coastal regions are becoming wetter as a result of increasing
   trends of rainfall.
   This study indicates that climate variability is likely to change soil
   moisture, although various regions will be affected differently.
   The development of informed adaptation strategies at the local scale is
   critical to cope effectively with climate variability.},

Title = {Impact of coal seam as interlayer on CO2 storage in saline aquifers: A
   reservoir simulation study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-114},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Geological storage of CO2 is a viable option for the mitigation of
   greenhouse gas emissions. Two main reservoir types exist; porous
   formations such as saline aquifers or depleted oil or gas reservoirs
   and, of lesser importance in terms of storage capacity, coal or shale
   reservoirs. These reservoirs have distinct storage mechanisms; in the
   porous formations the CO2 is stored within the porosity by compression
   and/or dissolution in the formation fluid, whereas in coal or shale, the
   CO2 is primarily stored by adsorption. Geological storage scenarios
   exist where these two reservoir types could be present within a
   geological sequence and come into contact with migrating CO2. In order
   to simulate this situation simulators are required which represent the
   mechanisms operating for both reservoir types. One aspect of the work
   presented in this paper involves further development of the coal seam
   gas reservoir simulator, SIMED 11, to include CO2 dissolution in
   formation waters and a more accurate Equation of State, the Span and
   Wagner model, to describe CO2 density. The modified model is first
   tested through a code comparison study with TOUGH2 for CO2 storage in a
   saline aquifer with dissolution in formation water, which finds that the
   two simulators are in close agreement. The second component of this
   paper involved investigating the potential impact that coal seams could
   have on CO2 storage in saline formations. A series of hypothetical cases
   are constructed to investigate the impact of coal seams as (1) a layer
   within the target aquifer above the injection point, (2) two layers
   separated by an aquifer above the injection point, (3) a layer in the
   target aquifer below the point of injection, and (4) a layer in the
   overburden. The results show that coal seams can have a significant
   impact on CO2 storage and migration behaviour by providing extra storage
   capacity and influencing the CO2 flow path both vertically and
   horizontally. The potential impact of coal seams in these scenarios is
   related to a range of factors but key ones are the adsorption capacity
   and the permeability. The results also demonstrate that coal seam
   permeability decrease due to CO2 adsorption induced coal swelling,
   although regarded as a technical obstacle to CO2 injection in the deep
   unminable coal seams to enhance coalbed methane recovery and for CO2
   storage in coal, would further influence the CO2 flow path, helping to
   reduce the upward CO2 flow due to buoyancy and pressure. This could act
   to reduce CO2 contact with cap rocks and lower the risk of CO2 leakage.

Abstract = {Assessing vulnerability is vital for developing new strategies and
   improving the existing ones to fulfill contemporary demands toward
   achieving a disaster-resilient society. Dammar Char is situated in the
   southeastern (SE) coastal region of Bangladesh that has experienced
   frequent coastal hazards and disasters throughout the year. The present
   study has constructed a vulnerability index utilizing the quantitative
   and qualitative data based on household surveys to evaluate the
   vulnerability of the people and community of Dammar Char. Data were
   collected from 180 respondents during November-December 2018. The
   results demonstrate that, on average, the people living in the studied
   area have a high vulnerability (value of the vulnerability index 0.7015)
   to coastal hazards and disasters. The vulnerability level differs from
   individual to individual based on their gender, educational status,
   financial capacity, structural strength of houses, perception of the
   respective hazards and disasters, etc. Females have experienced more
   vulnerability than their adult male counterparts. The natural
   vulnerability was higher than socioeconomic and physical vulnerability
   due to the increase in unpredictable extreme climate-induced coastal
   events. To combat the adverse impacts of coastal hazards and disasters,
   the local Dammar Char inhabitants have adopted several adaptation
   measures. The adapted measures are homestead gardening, working in
   seasonal day labor, fish drying, rearing sheep, and ducks, constructing
   plinths for elevating the floor of the house, extensive banana
   cultivation, and storage of dry foods to reduce their vulnerability.},

Title = {Scenario-Based Hydrological Modeling for Designing Climate-Resilient
   Coastal Water Resource Management Measures: Lessons from Brahmani River,
   Odisha, Eastern India},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Widespread urban expansion around the world, combined with rapid
   demographic and climatic changes, has resulted in serious pollution
   issues in many coastal water bodies. To help formulate coastal
   management strategies to mitigate the impacts of these extreme changes
   (e.g., local land-use or climate change adaptation policies), research
   methodologies that incorporate participatory approaches alongside with
   computer simulation modeling tools have potential to be particularly
   effective. One such research methodology, called the ``Participatory
   Coastal Land-Use Management{''} (PCLM) approach, consists of three major
   steps: (a) participatory approach to find key drivers responsible for
   the water quality deterioration, (b) scenario analysis using different
   computer simulation modeling tools for impact assessment, and (c) using
   these scientific evidences for developing adaptation and mitigation
   measures. In this study, we have applied PCLM approach in the Kendrapara
   district of India (focusing on the Brahmani River basin), a rapidly
   urbanizing area on the country's east coast to evaluate current status
   and predict its future conditions. The participatory approach involved
   key informant interviews to determine key drivers of water quality
   degradation, which served as an input for scenario analysis and
   hydrological simulation in the next step. Future river water quality
   (BOD and Total coliform (Tot. coli) as important parameters) was
   simulated using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool,
   considering a different plausible future scenario (to 2050)
   incorporating diverse drivers and pressures (i.e., population growth,
   land-use change, and climate change). Water samples (collected in 2018)
   indicated that the Brahmani River in this district was already
   moderately-to-extremely polluted in comparison to the desirable water
   quality (Class B), and modeling results indicated that the river water
   quality is likely to further deteriorate by 2050 under all of the
   considered scenarios. Demographic changes emerged as the major driver
   affecting the future water quality deterioration (68\% and 69\% for BOD
   and Tot. coli respectively), whereas climate change had the lowest
   impact on river water quality (12\% and 13\% for BOD and Tot. coli
   respectively), although the impact was not negligible. Scientific
   evidence to understand the impacts of future changes can help in
   developing diverse plausible coastal zone management approaches for
   ensuring sustainable management of water resources in the region. The
   PCLM approach, by having active stakeholder involvement, can help in
   co-generation of the coastal management options followed by open access
   free software, and models can play a relevant cost-effective approach to
   enhance science-policy interface for conservation of natural resources.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the evolution of major anthropogenic drivers of
   environmental impacts on Neotropical mangroves, the changes in the
   environmental pressures acting upon them, and the respective societal
   responses during the past 40 years. It reviews the impacts of new
   drivers, in particular those resulting from global climate change and
   the expansion in aquaculture and the effectiveness of local societal
   responses aimed at addressing them. Adaptation and mitigation actions
   are proposed to cope with the impacts and their socio-economic
   consequences for Latin America and Caribbean mangroves. By comparing the
   situation in Latin America and the Caribbean with other regions, the
   knowledge gaps and priority research needs are discussed to support
   delineating a preliminary unifying framework to address the
   environmental pressures affecting mangroves. This scenario necessarily
   includes the interaction of climate change with human interventions and
   their effects on ecosystem goods and services, as well as their
   respective adaptation and management options. Results show that drivers
   of environmental impacts have changed in the past 40 years, reducing the
   effectiveness of some important societal responses towards conservation
   and sustainable management with a great potential to increase rates of
   mangrove deforestation and conversion to human uses. Although efforts in
   conservation and restoration have contributed to decreasing pressure on
   these ecosystems, the coupling of old drivers, such as damming, with
   climate change, and the appearance of new drivers in the region, such as
   shrimp aquaculture, may eclipse the gains made through these
   conservation efforts. Despite the negative trend, we discuss some
   successful efforts to curb negative impacts of human activities on
   mangroves. We also recommend regional assessments based on primary
   sources in the representative mangrove-bearing countries throughout the
   continent to allow the upscaling of their experiences towards a regional
   response to the challenges facing Neotropical mangrove conservation and
   sustainable use.},

Abstract = {Humanity faces an increasing possibility that unusual and extreme
   natural disasters will increase, compounded with climate change,
   including global warming. These compound events are designated as
   compounded natural hazards in this study. A methodology must be
   developed for predicting what events and risks will confront future
   societies, to propose countermeasures and adaptation strategies against
   these events, and to evaluate the influences of compound disasters on
   infrastructure which is particularly situated near coasts and rivers.
   Based on the above-stated background and demands, this study was
   undertaken with the intention of upgrading the methodology for
   estimating effects on infrastructure of compound events such as
   increased typhoon and rainfall severity caused by global warming
   occurring concurrently with a great earthquake in Japan. Such a
   methodology is expected to contribute to progress in the fields of
   natural disaster mitigation and land preservation, particularly
   benefiting coastal and river areas in Japan. Additionally in this study,
   risk and economic loss analyses for the possible occurrence of compound
   disasters for coastal infrastructure and foundations are produced for
   establishing environmental strategies at the governmental level. The
   authors further propose adaptation strategies and techniques as
   countermeasures against these events.},

Title = {Lessons from climate-related planned relocations: the case of Vietnam},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Pages = {600-609},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Planned relocation is increasingly recognized and implemented as a
   climate change adaptation strategy. Nascent literature on
   climate-related relocation draws on findings and experience from
   development-forced displacement and resettlement (DFDR), yet DFDR
   contexts lack a key factor central in climate-related relocation:
   uncertain environmental change. The article therefore examines how
   planning and implementing authorities address environmental uncertainty
   and what implications this may have for relocation outcomes. In the case
   of coastal erosion and related relocation schemes in Central Vietnam,
   linked to climate change, the article focuses on responsible government
   institutions. It looks at the governmental practices they employ to
   manage environmental change and related relocation. Based on field
   study, in-depth interviews, and document and policy review, the article
   finds that the sub-national institutions responsible for relocation
   attempted to make environmental change legible through quantifying and
   standardizing fluctuations in coastal erosion. These technical
   approaches carried through planning and implementation. They contributed
   to rigid relocation programmes in which households' input and adaptive
   outcomes were limited and other political goals were realized through
   territorialization. The findings support literature on the highly
   political nature of adaptation and challenge the prominence of technical
   approaches to adaptation.},

Title = {Impact of Relative Sea-Level Rise on Low-Lying Coastal Areas of
   Catalonia, NW Mediterranean, Spain},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Low-lying coastal areas are high-risk areas regarding sea-level rise
   (SLR) due to the combination of low elevation, subsidence and currently
   low sediment supply, on the one hand, and their high natural and
   socio-economic values, on the other. Because of this, there is a growing
   need to assess the integrated impact of SLR taking into account the
   interactions between physical and ecological factors to make more
   informed decisions for the design of adaptation strategies. This study
   presents a methodology for improved SLR-induced flood-damage assessments
   in natural areas which is composed of (i) a pseudo-dynamic method
   coupling equilibrium-based coastal response and classical bathtub
   modeling approaches and (ii) a simple method to account for habitat
   conversion following inundation. This methodology is applied to
   low-lying coastal areas of Catalonia under different SLR scenarios,
   which show very different sensitivities depending on the configuration
   of the water-land border, topography, geomorphology, and degree of human
   impact on the floodplain. In terms of potential impact, natural habitats
   will be the most benefited from the likely conversion at the expense of
   agriculture lands. This can help coastal managers to adopt adaptation
   strategies where considering the inherent capacity of some coastal
   landscapes to adapt opens up new alternatives.},

Title = {Moving up or going under? Differential livelihood trajectories in
   coastal communities in Vietnam},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {138},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Transformations from artisanal fishing to aquaculture are now ubiquitous
   in many small-scale coastal fishing communities worldwide, often in
   response to the economics of fisheries and climate change. Understanding
   the long-term dynamics of community livelihoods is an important step in
   designing appropriate fishery management and adaptation policies to
   navigate the effects of such transformations. The literature has focused
   predominantly on addressing snapshots of livelihood conditions, with
   less attention being paid to how present conditions have emerged over
   time, and for whom. Using an integrated analytical approach, this study
   investigates the longitudinal livelihood trajectories in two smallscale
   fishery villages around the Tam Giang Lagoon in Vietnam, with particular
   attention paid to the changes since the introduction of aquaculture in
   the late 1980s. Three distinct livelihood trajectories - accumulating,
   fluctuating, and marginalising - represent the differential pathways
   available to fishing and aquaculture-dependent households. In this
   constrained yet shared resource space, the transformational adaptation
   through aquaculture has benefitted the adopters and enhanced their
   livelihood resilience; yet, it has had detrimental consequences for the
   artisanal fishers who find themselves locked into a state of heightened
   vulnerability. The findings provide evidence of differential and
   unintended consequences of new adaptations to livelihood struggles in
   small-scale fishery communities, and they point to the need for
   well-targeted policies to reduce rather than exacerbate growing
   inequalities. Fishery management policies and interventions in this
   lagoon, and similar contexts, need to take into account the
   heterogeneity in livelihood trajectories and unequal social
   vulnerability to inform more just adaptation strategies and improve the
   wellbeing of fishery communities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The International Long Term Ecological Research (ILTER) network can
   coordinate ecological research to provide observations of the ecosystem
   changes, and their socio-economic impacts on human societies at
   different scales. In this paper we demonstrate the importance of the
   ILTER network in the study and monitoring of environmental changes at a
   global level. We give examples of how biodiversity and ecosystem service
   data can be used to study impacts and adaptation options in response to
   climate change. Analysis of the 107 recent publications from LTER
   networks representing 21 countries show that LTER studies are often
   local and heterogeneous. There are some ecosystem types, such as
   agricultural or coastal ecosystems that are not covered with current
   ILTER network. Standardized monitoring schemes and techniques should be
   considered for future steering of ILTER collaboration. Integrating and
   synthesizing the collected data should be prioritized for future
   cooperation, and integrated in decision-making.},

Title = {PROSPECTS OF CASHEW CULTIVATION UNDER CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS IN HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE, VOL 1: PRINCIPLES AND
   APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {85-104},
Abstract = {Cashew is usually grown as a rainfed crop in ecologically sensitive
   areas such as coastal belts, hilly areas and areas with high rainfall
   and humidity, andhence its performance mainly depends on climate.
   Studies on suitability of cashew cultivation in India using GIS showed
   that cashew grows at an elevation ranging from 0 to 1000 m above MSL.
   However, the productivity is the highest up to the altitude of 750 m
   above MSL. The average annual rainfall distribution in cashew areas
   ranges from low rainfall (300-600 mm in Gujarat) to high rainfall
   (2700-3000 mm in west coast and NEH region) but the productivity is
   highest in regions with a mean annual rainfall distribution of 600-1500
   mm. The productivity of cashew is higher in regions where the minimum
   temperature ranges from 10 to 22 square C and is lower in regions where
   the minimum temperature drops below 10 degrees C. Unseasonal rains and
   heavy dew during flowering and fruiting periods are the major factors
   which adversely affect the nut yield. Heavy rains at the time of
   harvesting affects yield and quality of nuts. Cloudy conditions, high RH
   and heavy dewfall are favorable for outbreak of insect pests and
   diseases. To circumvent losses due to climate variability/change,
   adaptation and mitigation strategies are essential in affected areas.
   Some of the adaptation strategies include plant architecture, use of
   efficient technologies like drip irrigation, soil and moisture
   conservations measures, fertilizer management through fertigation, green
   manuring/intercropping, increase in input efficiency, pre and
   post-harvest management of economic produce cannot only minimize the
   losses but also increase the positive impacts of climate change. The
   flowering, fruiting, insect pest incidence in cashew crop, yield and
   quality of cashew nut and kernels are more vulnerable attributes for
   climate change. The sea water level rise due to the melting of glaciers
   as a result of increase in temperature may also pose problem for cashew
   cultivation since large proportion of cashew plantations exist in
   Eastern and Western Coastal regions of India. The perennial cashew crop
   has potential for carbon sequestration for mitigation of climate change.},

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {407-423},
Abstract = {Community-based adaptation (CBA) has emerged as an important component
   of the global response to climate change. Numerous tools have been
   developed to support communities to adapt, and to guide the agencies
   that they work with. Despite the proliferation of CBA tools, a number of
   critical challenges exist. For example, CBA tools often overlap, and
   there is confusion regarding when and how the tools should be applied.
   There is a lack of tools that communicate climate information in locally
   relevant ways; support the application of resilience as a unifying
   framework; support monitoring and evaluation of CBA; and provide
   technical guidance on the implementation of locally appropriate
   adaptation options. Additionally, guidance is needed to move from
   community-led vulnerability assessments to adaptation actions. This
   article explores these challenges, offers guidance on tool selection,
   tailoring, and development, and provides lessons learned based on the
   results from a multiyear CBA program by a consortium of organizations in
   Vanuatu. These lessons are relevant to the development and
   implementation of CBA activities globally.},

Abstract = {Managing integrated social-ecological systems to reduce risks to human
   and environmental well-being remains challenging in light of the rate
   and extent of undesirable changes that are occurring. Developing
   frameworks that are sufficiently integrative to guide research to
   deliver the necessary insights into all key system aspects is an
   important outstanding task. Among existing approaches, resilience and
   nexus framings both allow focus on unpacking relationships across scales
   and levels in a system and emphasize the involvement of different groups
   in decision making to different extents. They also suffer weaknesses and
   neither approach puts social justice considerations explicitly at its
   core. This has important implications for understanding who wins and
   loses out from different decisions and how social and ecological risks
   and trade-offs are shared and distributed, temporally and spatially.
   This paper conceptually integrates resilience and nexus approaches,
   developing a combined framework and indicating how it could effectively
   be operationalized in cases from mountain and mangrove social-ecological
   systems. In doing so, it advances understanding of complex
   social-ecological systems framings for risk-based decision making beyond
   that which could be achieved through use of either resilience or nexus
   approaches alone. Important next steps in testing the framework involve
   empirical and field operationalization, requiring interdisciplinary,
   mixed method approaches.},

Abstract = {The integration of climate change adaptation considerations into
   management of the coast poses major challenges for decision makers. This
   article reports on a case study undertaken in Christchurch Bay, UK,
   examining local capacity for strategic response to climate risks, with a
   particular focus on issues surrounding coastal defense. Drawing
   primarily on qualitative research with local and regional stakeholders,
   the analysis identifies fundamental disjunctures between generic
   concerns over climate change and the adaptive capacity of local
   management institutions. Closely linked with issues of scale, the
   problems highlighted here are likely to have broad and continuing
   relevance for future coastal management elsewhere.},

Title = {Adapting water resources to climate change in Kiribati: the importance
   of cultural values and meanings},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Pages = {799-809},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In many Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States,
   such as in Kiribati, formal national adaptation programmes are currently
   being operationalised. A key focus is enhancing the adaptive capacity of
   vulnerable communities through piloting of sectoral adaptation
   strategies such as diversifying water resources. This study argues that
   fundamental to water management and adaptation planning is the
   integration of people's cultural values attached to the assets/resources
   they control and utilise in their efforts to adapt to various stresses
   on water resources. The results from integrating cultural resources into
   a Sustainable Livelihoods Framework indicate that people's capacity to
   diversify is constrained by cultural processes negotiated in their daily
   lives that reinforced and reproduced hardships. Material resources
   provided personal significance when they were spent on maintaining
   social identity, expressed in recent times through the church. Thus
   fewer resources were available for pursuing a diversification strategy.
   Furthermore, power structures in the church delimited benefits to the
   individual, depriving people of their freedom to exercise autonomous
   agency and achieve personal wellbeing. The study demonstrates the
   significance of religion to adaptation. Moreover, it highlights the need
   to consider the relational aspects of assets, in conditioning how people
   access and utilise assets in pursuing adaptation strategies. (C) 2009

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1},
Pages = {547-566},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increase of frequency and severity of extreme weather events due to
   climate change gives evidence of severe challenges faced by
   infrastructure systems. Among them, the aviation sector is particularly
   at risk from the potential consequences of climate change. Airports are
   classified as critical infrastructures because they provide fundamental
   functions to sustain societies and economic activities. More
   specifically, Mediterranean airports face risks associated with sea
   level rise, higher occurrence of extreme temperature and precipitation
   events. These aspects require the implementation of appropriate risk
   assessments and definition of targeted adaptation strategies, which are
   still limited in the Mediterranean region. The aim of the present paper
   is to provide theoretical frameworks in order to assess risks of climate
   change on Mediterranean airports, related to extreme temperature,
   extreme precipitation and sea level rise. Starting from a review of the
   literature, we first identify the sources of climate risk that may
   induce potential impacts on airports, here divided in air side and land
   side components. In order to do so, we select a series of indicators
   used as proxies for identifying hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The
   application of these theoretical frameworks allows defining the level of
   risk associated to each hazard, with the goal to support the
   identification of specific adaptation measures for the Mediterranean
   airports.},

Title = {Evaluation of the combined threat from sea-level rise and sedimentation
   reduction to the coastal wetlands in the Yangtze Estuary, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {346-354},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the prospect of climate change, in particular sea
   level rise (SLR) and its impacts on low-lying coastal areas has
   generated worldwide attention. The coastal wetlands located in the
   Yangtze Estuary, with their low elevation and decreasing sediment
   loading, are susceptible to both SLR and anthropogenic activities.
   Taking the Chongming Dongtan wetlands as a study area, two scenarios of
   SLR were evaluated: the present trend (1980-2010) of SLR 2.6 mm/yr
   (PSLR) and the IPCC A(1)F(1) scenario of 5.9 mm/yr (HSLR). In addition,
   two scenarios of sedimentation rate were adopted for the Yangtze
   Estuary: the current sedimentation rate (CSR) and a reduced
   sedimentation rate of half of the present rate (1/2CSR). The combined
   effects of SLR and sedimentation reduction were evaluated by projection
   of the combinations of these phenomena for 2025, 2050 and 2100, using a
   Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). The results showed that the
   combined effects of sea-level rise, reduced sedimentation and land
   subsidence could result in a considerable decrease in or even complete
   loss of the coastal wetland habitat in the Chongming Dongtan nature
   reserve, particularly under the medium-term (2050) and long-term (2100)
   scenarios. Without proper mitigation measures, the potential decrease in
   and loss of habitats and ecosystem services is inevitable. Such
   mitigation measures should be considered in the future for securing the
   coastal wetland ecosystems, which include the management of
   sedimentation, the rehabilitation and recreation of wetland habitat and
   the control and limitation of reclamation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate different heat mitigation
   strategies and determine the optimal choice for old neighborhoods
   renovation. A residential building with the parking lot in front of it
   was selected as the research object. Various critical factors affecting
   outdoor thermal condition, such as tree location, pavement material,
   wind speed and direction, ``hedge{''} type, were simulated and examined
   with ENVI-met and Rayman model. Air temperature, mean radiant
   temperature (MRT), physiological equivalent temperature (PET) were used
   to assess the outdoor thermal comfort level. The results show that: 1)
   concrete replacing asphalt as pavement material could effectively lower
   air temperature; 2) planting trees on the west or south side is a better
   choice in creating a more thermally comfortable outdoor environment when
   available space is limited in the targeted area; 3) compared with wind
   direction, wind speed has a more significant influence on outdoor
   thermal condition; 4) water body's cooling efficiency is superior to
   that of grassland. The findings of this study could provide useful
   guidance in the process of renovating old neighborhood in the city.},

Abstract = {Five mainland SEA countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, and
   Thailand) are threatened by climate change. Here, the latest 18 Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) is employed to examine
   future climate change in this region under two SSP-RCP (shared
   socioeconomic pathway-representative concentration pathway) scenarios
   (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). The bias-corrected multi-model ensemble (MME)
   projects a warming (wetting) over Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, and
   Thailand by 1.88-3.89, 2.04-4.22, 1.88-4.09, 2.03-4.25, and 1.90-3.96
   degrees C (8.76-20.47, 12.69-21.10, 9.54-21.10, 13.47-22.12, and
   7.03-15.17\%) in the 21st century with larger values found under
   SSP5-8.5 than SSP2-4.5. The MME model displays approximately triple the
   current rainfall during the boreal summer. Overall, there are robust
   increases in rainfall during the Southwest Monsoon (3.41-3.44,
   8.44-9.53, and 10.89-17.59\%) and the Northeast Monsoon (-2.58 to 0.78,
   -0.43 to 2.81, and 2.32 to 5.45\%). The effectiveness of anticipated
   climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies under SSP2-4.5
   results in slowing down the warming trends and decreasing precipitation
   trends after 2050. All these findings imply that member countries of
   mainland SEA need to prepare for appropriate adaptation measures in
   response to the changing climate.},

Abstract = {Size-based indicators are used worldwide in research that supports the
   management of commercially exploited wild fish populations, because of
   their responsiveness to fishing pressure. Observational and experimental
   data, however, have highlighted the deeply rooted links between fish
   size and environmental conditions that can drive additional, interannual
   changes in these indicators. Here, we have used biogeochemical and
   mechanistic niche modelling of commercially exploited demersal fish
   species to project time series to the end of the 21st century for one
   such indicator, the large fish indicator (LFI), under global CO2
   emissions scenarios. Our modelling results, validated against survey
   data, suggest that the LFI's previously proposed policy target may be
   unachievable under future climate change. In turn, our results help to
   identify what may be achievable policy targets for demersal fish
   communities experiencing climate change. While fisheries modelling has
   grown as a science, climate change modelling is seldom used specifically
   to address policy aims. Studies such as this one can, however, enable a
   more sustainable exploitation of marine food resources under changes
   unmanageable by fisheries control. Indeed, such studies can be used to
   aid resilient policy target setting by taking into account
   climate-driven effects on fish community size-structure.},

Year = {2014},
Pages = {589-603},
Abstract = {Current projections for the twenty-first century show that global
   warming will accelerate, with stronger storms, extreme precipitation,
   dry spells and rising sea levels as the primary symptoms. Such changes
   will have implications in seafood production, security, and safety, as
   well as in human health, due to the increase in the frequency of harmful
   algal blooms, levels and bioaccumulation of several chemical
   contaminants, prevalence and virulence of common foodborne pathogenic
   microorganisms. The Mediterranean will be particularly affected by
   climate change due to water scarcity in the region. Assuring seafood
   safety in such scenario requires the active involvement of all
   stakeholders to elaborate and implement adaptation and mitigation plans.
   In this context, the current chapter aims to provide an overview of the
   potential effects of climate change in the Mediterranean seafood safety
   and human health, taking into account chemical and biological
   contaminants, and to discuss potential adaptation and mitigation
   measures.},

Abstract = {Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy is the largest movement
   of local governments committed to going beyond their own national
   climate and energy objectives, fully in line with the UN Sustainable
   Development Goals and climate justice principles. Every signatory
   develops a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) to
   mitigate climate change. In the Plan for the Protection of European
   Water Resources, the European Commission expresses the urgency that
   EU-members focus on environmentally friendly growth and make the
   resources used more efficient, including water resources, in order to
   sustainably overcome the current economic and environmental crisis,
   adapt to climate change and increase the possibility of strengthening
   the competitiveness and growth of the European water sector. A component
   of urban systems affected by climate change is the hydrological one. The
   leading causes affecting hydrological component are floods. The Floods
   Directive 2007/60/EC establishes a framework on the assessment and
   management of flood risk, aiming at the reduction of the potential
   adverse consequences of flooding for human health, the environment,
   cultural heritage and economic activity. In this work, we propose a
   first-level framework to identify critical areas for water management in
   urban contexts. This study involves 13 sub-catchments located in the
   urban area of the Municipality of Potenza, in Southern Italy. The
   proposed approach could promote, in the ambit of SECAP (Sustainable
   Energy Climate Action), the development of mitigation actions and
   investment sizing for urban water management strategies in critical
   urban contexts.},

Title = {Stakeholder-Informed Ecosystem Modeling of Ocean Warming and
   Acidification Impacts in the Barents Sea Region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Climate change and ocean acidification are anticipated to alter marine
   ecosystems, with consequences for the provision of marine resources and
   ecosystem services to human societies. However, considerable
   uncertainties about future ecological changes and ensuing socio-economic
   impacts impede the identification of societal adaptation strategies. In
   a case study from the Barents Sea and Northern Norwegian Sea region, we
   integrated stakeholder perceptions of ecological changes and their
   significance for societies with the current state of scientific
   knowledge, to investigate the marine-human system under climate change
   and identify societal adaptation options. Stakeholders were engaged
   through personal interviews, two local workshops, and a web based
   survey, identifying the most relevant ecosystem services potentially
   impacted and developing an integrated system dynamics model which links
   climate change scenarios to the response of relevant species.
   Stakeholder perceptions of temperature-dependent multiannual
   fluctuations of fish stocks, interactions among fish, marine mammal, and
   seabird populations, and ecological processes such as primary production
   are represented in the model. The model was used for a discourse-based
   stakeholder evaluation of potential ecosystem changes under ocean
   warming and acidification scenarios, identifying shifts in ecosystem
   service provision and discussing associated societal adaptation options.
   The results pointed to differences in adaptive capacity among user
   groups. Small-scale fishers and tourism businesses are potentially more
   affected by changing spatial distribution and local declines in marine
   species than industrial fisheries. Changes in biodiversity, especially
   extinctions of polar species, and ecosystem functioning were a concern
   from an environmental conservation viewpoint. When considering potential
   additional impacts of ocean acidification, changes observed in the model
   projections were more uniformly valued as negative, and associated with
   an increased potential for conflicts among user groups. The
   stakeholder-informed ecosystem modeling approach has succeeded in
   driving a discussion and interchange among stakeholder groups and with
   scientists, integrating knowledge about climate change impacts in the
   social-ecological system and identifying important factors that shape
   societal responses. The approach can thus serve to improve governance of
   marine systems by incorporating knowledge about system dynamics and
   about societal uses and values.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic showed us how fragile cities are when dealing with
   this phenomenon. The lack of green areas, high pollution levels, and
   human overpopulation contributed to the increase of the urban heat
   island effect and proved to be the perfect ingredients for the spread of
   the virus that changed, perhaps forever, our ways of living inhabiting.
   The consequences were even more dramatic for the inhabitants of informal
   neighbourhoods, as these exacerbated existing problems related to
   economic instability and low food and water security. This paper
   proposes using Nature-Based Solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate
   change and increase access to water in informal settlements. The
   research study focused on analysing two technologies, the Blue-Green
   roof and Rain Garden, developing a prototype for each one. Considering
   that the practice of self-building characterises spontaneous
   settlements, the modules were conceived to be built by the inhabitants
   using recycled materials. These low-tech strategies improve indoor
   thermal comfort, facilitate the storage of filtered rainwater for
   domestic use and provide access to affordable food through domestic
   scale cultivation. Implementing these solutions in marginalised
   neighbourhoods could also empower residents to face challenges related
   to Global Warming, such as runoffs generated by heavy precipitations,
   and improve hygienic conditions to prevent the spread of diseases.},

Abstract = {Cities are the predominant places for human beings to settle down, thus
   becoming more vulnerable to extreme weather events aggravating phenomena
   like heat stress and decreasing air quality aroused by inner city
   pollution. The excessive warming of impervious surfaces and additional
   release of anthropogenic heat promotes urban heat island (UHI)
   formation. Human activities lead to an increase of emissions of air
   pollutants which in turn influences the chemical composition of urban
   air. In this study, the mesoscale chemical transport model WRF-Chem is
   used for the urban area of Stuttgart to simulate the effect of UHI
   mitigation strategies such as urban greening and high albedo materials
   on the concentration of primary and secondary pollutants.},

Title = {Cultural heritage and sea level rise threat: risk assessment of coastal
   fortifications in the Canary Islands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts on coastal fortifications due to changing
   groundwater levels, flood risks, or rising sea levels, are threatening
   the conservation of these assets. Some castles and fortifications have a
   high level of structural instability due to their high exposure to
   changing environmental conditions, especially those in direct contact
   with the sea. This article focuses on identifying the level of risk
   posed by climate change to coastal fortifications in the Canary Islands.
   The methodology implemented identifies the exposure and vulnerability of
   these fortifications, based on a scorecard assigning values of risk to
   rising sea levels. Four risk categories were selected based on their
   exposure to either coastal flooding, coastal erosion or coastline
   retreat, and taking into account its sensitivity through a structural
   analysis of buildings. There are currently fifteen coastal
   fortifications from the Early Modern Period in this archipelago and two
   have been identified as being especially threatened by rising sea
   levels. Results highlight a need to increase their adaptive capacity,
   incorporating changes in legislation, including climate change
   adaptation measures as a basic strategy in cultural heritage management.
   Options such as the construction of submerged defenses or dikes in order
   to dissipate the force of the waves could be successful adaptation
   measures, considered from the perspective of preserving both the
   landscape and the environment of these historical sites. This assessment
   provides support to policy makers for the management of coastal
   fortifications in the context of climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Principles for an intergovernmental agreement for coastal planning and

Volume = {33},

Pages = {293-299},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The future design of urban settlements and infrastructure in response to
   climate change will be critical in the future. Urban planning for human
   settlements will require both an intergovernmental and
   multi-disciplinary approach integrating science and urban planning. The
   paper focuses on coastal urbanisation and the planning for climate
   change. The Australian coastal zone is home to over 85\% of the
   Australian population with coastal townships expanding rapidly. The
   International Panel on Climate Change predicts that the Australian coast
   will experience increasing storm surge and rising sea levels. A set of
   principles is proposed that should underpin an intergovernmental
   agreement on coastal planning and climate change. The Agreement would
   include actions such as regional planning, policy integration, financial
   incentives and innovative regulatory mechanisms that use both mitigation
   and adaptation in complimentary and reinforcing ways. Selected case
   studies including peri-urban and sea change locations are used to
   examine the possibilities and obstacles for current urban planning and
   institutional arrangements to incorporate such mitigation and adaptation
   measures for climate change. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adaptation Design Tool for Climate-Smart Management of Coral Reefs and
   Other Natural Resources},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {644-664},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scientists and managers of natural resources have recognized an urgent
   need for improved methods and tools to enable effective adaptation of
   management measures in the face of climate change. This paper presents
   an Adaptation Design Tool that uses a structured approach to break down
   an otherwise overwhelming and complex process into tractable steps. The
   tool contains worksheets that guide users through a series of design
   considerations for adapting their planned management actions to be more
   climate-smart given changing environmental stressors. Also provided with
   other worksheets is a framework for brainstorming new adaptation options
   in response to climate threats not yet addressed in the current plan.
   Developed and tested in collaboration with practitioners in Hawai'i and
   Puerto Rico using coral reefs as a pilot ecosystem, the tool and
   associated reference materials consist of worksheets, instructions and
   lessons-learned from real-world examples. On the basis of stakeholder
   feedback from expert consultations during tool development, we present
   insights and recommendations regarding how to maximize tool efficiency,
   gain the greatest value from the thought process, and deal with issues
   of scale and uncertainty. We conclude by reflecting on how the tool
   advances the theory and practice of assessment and decision-making
   science, informs higher level strategic planning, and serves as a
   platform for a systematic, transparent and inclusive process to tackle
   the practical implications of climate change for management of natural
   resources.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Much scholarly attention has been paid to the issue of climate change in
   the Pacific Islands, in terms of its geopolitical implications, and
   through the lens of mitigation and adaptation policies and strategies.
   Comparatively little focus has been given to the domestic politics of
   climate change in the region: How a changing climate is affecting
   internal political dynamics. This article traces the boundaries of a new
   research agenda on the impacts of climate change within Pacific states
   as an animating political dynamic. It considers climate change as a
   possible source of political change and contestation; as a critical
   domestic policy issue; and as a driver of political participation and
   organisation. Climate change is an existential threat to the Pacific
   Islands, yet it has unique power as a mass mobilising factor in the
   largely localised and fragmented politics of the region. We conclude
   with some reflections on the potential of climate change as a key
   political driver in the region, and fruitful avenues for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) has made great contributions to climate change
   mitigation research, in terms of its systems thinking and solid
   methodologies such as life cycle assessment, material flow analysis, and
   environmentally extended input-output analysis. However, its potential
   contribution to climate change adaptation is unclear. Adaptation has
   become increasingly urgent in a continuously changing climate,
   especially in developing countries, which are projected to bear the
   brunt of climate-change-related damages. On the basis of a brief review
   of climate change impacts and adaptation literature, we suggest that IE
   can play an important role in the following two aspects. First, with the
   emphasis on a systems perspective, IE can help us determine how climate
   change interacts with our socio-economic system and how the interactions
   may aggravate (or moderate) its direct impacts or whether they may shift
   burden to other environmental impacts. Second, IE methodologies can help
   us quantify the direct and indirect environmental impacts of adaptation
   activities, identify mitigation opportunities, and achieve sustainable
   adaptation. Further, we find that substantial investment is needed to
   increase the resilience of infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy, and
   water supply) and agriculture in developing countries. Because these
   sectors are also the main drivers of environmental degradation, how to
   achieve sustainable climate-resilient infrastructure and agriculture in
   developing countries deserves special attention in future IE studies.
   Overall, IE thinking and methodologies have great potential to
   contribute to climate change adaptation research and policy questions,
   and exploring this growing field will, in turn, inspire IE development.},

Abstract = {Contemporary social and economic development of cities is often
   challenged by the intensification of extreme weather events caused by
   climate change. Their occurrence leads to damage in social, economic,
   environmental, and spatial sphere at multiple layers. Cities that make
   up the Delta Cities network are areas, which due to their location are
   exposed to similar climate events. As a result, it is necessary to
   improve their resilience and prepare society, economy, and the
   environment to the effects of negative events. In order to achieve it,
   urban space should be designed and developed in a way that would ensure
   the continuity of operations of enterprises and critical technical,
   social, and transport infrastructure. The goal of the paper is to
   identify threats and directions of adaptation actions undertaken by
   cities within the Delta Cities network to potentially develop
   waterfronts as areas especially exposed to sea-borne risks. The paper
   also draws attention to the fact that in adaptation strategies climate
   change is treated not only as a threat but also as opportunity for
   economic development, enhanced innovation, attractiveness, and
   competitiveness of the city.},

Abstract = {Previous evaluation of flood risk overlooks the behavior and capacity of
   private stakeholders, thus limiting the application of adaptation
   policies. This study presents an agent-based model, applied to
   Miami-Dade County, FL, as the case study, to explore the public and
   private interaction in coastal flood adaptation and mitigation. The
   decision making of individuals' adaptive behavior is simulated based on
   the prospected theory under households' risk perception, insurance
   policies, and the local flood mitigation. The NFIP and private insurance
   policy are simulated separately to reflect the flood insurance market.
   Our results show that households' risk mitigation behaviors are
   clustered in high-risk coastal areas, including Miami-Beach and the east
   coast of the County. The overall flood risk is still high in the
   southern part of the County. To better reflect the flooding risk and
   address the affordability issue, a voucher coupled house elevation
   program could improve the insurance take-up rates as well as reduce the
   overall flood risk in the area. Results also indicate that private
   insurance would slightly increase if the NFIP's insurance rates
   increase. Afterward, four adaptation scenarios in response to future sea
   level rises are examined by considering the voucher-based insurance
   program and the local adaptation actions. Compared with the high-risk
   reduction but low coverage mitigation plan, more extensive coverage of
   public adaptation would better improve the overall adaptation outcome of
   the County, which indicates the importance of public participation in
   local risk mitigation and urban governance.},

Abstract = {Differences in population-level climate change beliefs have been
   identified, which are often attributable to coastline proximity,
   urban-rural classifications, race, ethnicity, political affiliation,
   gender, education, socioeconomic status, and age. This study assessed
   the impact of spatial, experiential, and demographic-related
   characteristics on climate change beliefs among a population of
   Hurricane Katrina survivors. Participants from the Gulf Coast Child and
   Family Health Study who answered climate change belief questions were
   included in this analysis. Race was found to be the most critical
   contributor to climate change belief, where the adjusted odds of white
   individuals believing in climate change were 0.2 times the odds of Black
   individuals believing in climate change (confidence interval: 0.1-0.4).
   Other sociodemographic factors, such as age, gender, income, and
   education, were not found to be significant. Several theoretical
   perspectives were considered to explain the variation in climate change
   beliefs, including social vulnerability, environmental deprivation, and
   political ideology. Future research as to why these racial differences
   exist should be conducted. By doing so, climate change communication,
   education, and mitigation and adaptation strategies may be improved.},

Abstract = {Extreme heat poses a threat to the livability and sustainability of
   cities, and disproportionally harms marginalized groups. The frequency
   of extreme heat events is expected to increase in the future as climate
   change exacerbates urban heat island (UHI) effects. Common UHI
   mitigation strategies - such as cool pavements (light-colored surfacing
   or permeable pavements), cool roofs (often categorized as ``white{''},
   ``blue{''}, or ``green{''} roof strategies to differentiate the
   approaches), and increased planting of vegetation - vary in
   effectiveness depending on a city's baseline climate, as well as on city
   size and layout. Microclimate mitigation efforts must move beyond
   exterior site-level strategies to consider land-use planning at the
   neighborhood level and the role of passive cooling strategies for
   buildings. Green infrastructure offers benefits in the form of improved
   stormwater management, air quality, carbon sequestration, and
   microclimate regulation. The creation of a new utility - one akin to a
   public company that provides services such as electricity or water and
   that recognizes the multiple and overlapping environmental and social
   benefits of green infrastructure - may expedite implementation of such
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Purpose While the South Pacific is often cited as highly vulnerable to
   the impacts of climate change, there is comparatively little known about
   how different groups perceive climate change. Understanding the gaps and
   differences between risk and perceived risk is a prerequisite to
   designing effective and sustainable adaptation strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach This research examined three key groups in
   Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu: secondary school teachers, media personnel, and
   rural subsistence livelihood-based communities that live near or in
   conservation areas. This study deployed a dual methodology of
   participatory focus groups, paired with a national mobile phone based
   survey to gauge perceptions of climate change. This was the first time
   mobile technology had been used to gather perceptual data regarding the
   environment in the South Pacific.
   Findings The research findings highlighted a number of important
   differences and similarities in ways that these groups perceive climate
   change issues, solutions, personal vulnerability and comprehension of
   science among other factors.
   Practical implications These differences and similarities are neglected
   in large-scale top-down climate change adaptation strategies and have
   key implications for the design of disaster risk reduction and climate
   change adaptation and therefore sustainable development in the region.
   Originality/value The research was innovative in terms of its methods,
   as well as its distillation of the perceptions of climate change from
   teachers, media and rural communities.},

Abstract = {The combination of climate change impacts, declining fluvial sediment
   supply, and heavy human utilization of the coastal zone, arguably the
   most populated and developed land zone in the world, will very likely
   lead to massive socio-economic and environmental losses in the coming
   decades. Effective coastal planning/management strategies that can help
   circumvent such losses require reliable local scale (<similar to 10km)
   projections of coastal change resulting from the integrated effect of
   climate change driven variations in mean sea level, storm surge, waves,
   and riverflows. Presently available numerical models are unable to
   adequately fulfill this need. A new generation of multi-scale,
   probabilistic coastal change models is urgently needed to
   comprehensively assess and optimise coastal risk at local scale,
   enabling risk informed, climate proof adaptation measures that strike a
   good balance between risk and reward.},

Abstract = {This study presents numerical simulations analysing the effect of urban
   heat island (UHI) mitigation measures on the chemical composition of the
   urban atmosphere. The mesoscale chemical transport model WRF-Chem is
   used to investigate the impact of urban greening and highly reflective
   surfaces on the concentrations of primary (CO, NO) as well as secondary
   pollutants (O-3) inside the urban canopy. In order to account for the
   sub-grid scale heterogeneity of urban areas, a multi-layer urban canopy
   model is coupled to WRF-Chem. Using this canopy model at its full extend
   requires the introduction of several urban land use classes in WRF-Chem.
   The urban area of Stuttgart serves as a test bed for the modelling of a
   case scenario of the 2003 European Heat Wave. The selected mitigation
   measures are able to reduce the urban temperature by about 1 K and the
   mean ozone concentration by 5-8\%. Model results however document also
   negative secondary effects on urban air quality, which are closely
   related to a decrease of vertical mixing in the urban boundary layer. An
   increase of primary pollutants NO and CO by 5-25\% can be observed. In
   addition, highly reflective surfaces can increase peak ozone
   concentration by up to 12\% due to a high intensity of reflected
   shortwave radiation accelerating photochemical reactions. (C) 2015 The

   adaptation (CBA) projects which draw on the skills of the community to
   address the climate change-related hazards that are expected to affect
   local communities. Through semi-structured interviews with community
   members from the urban/peri-urban area around Apia (with and without
   insurance) and an insurance company representative, this research
   explores private household natural perils insurance uptake in Samoa and
   the effect that the uptake of this insurance has on household engagement
   in other climate change adaptation (CCA) strategies such as CBA
   projects. Findings suggest that individuals whose homes are already
   insured with natural perils insurance are more likely to express more
   individualistic values or beliefs than those without natural perils
   insurance. Insured homeowners commonly framed adaptation as a technical
   challenge, with insurance being part of the technical and expert-led
   approach to prepare for, manage and recover from extreme events. In
   contrast, householders without insurance perceived CCA as less of a
   technical task and more of a social process. Those individuals with
   private household natural perils insurance coverage (in keeping with
   their more individualistic values) reported that they were less engaged
   in CBA projects compared to participants without insurance (who held
   more communalistic values). Given the importance of household
   participation in CBA projects, an increased uptake of insurance may have
   problematic outcomes for the adaptive capacity of the broader community.},

Abstract = {Small-scale coastal fisheries (SSCF) in the Western region of Ghana are
   affected by a combination of climate and non-climate stressors. Coastal
   communities are particularly vulnerable to these stressors because of
   their proximity to the sea and high dependence on small-scale fisheries
   for their livelihoods. A better understanding of how fishing
   communities, particularly SSCF, respond to climate and non-climate
   stressors is paramount to improve planning and implementation of
   effective adaptation action. Drawing on the capitals framework, this
   study examines the adaptive capacity of SSCF to the combined effects of
   climate-related (increasing coastal erosion, and wave and storm
   frequency) and non-climate-related stressors (declining catches;
   scarcity and prohibitive cost of fuel; inconsiderate implementation of
   fisheries laws and policies; competition from the oil and gas industry;
   sand mining; and algal blooms). The findings show how fishers mobilise
   and use adaptive capacity through exploitation of various forms of
   capital, including cultural capital (e.g., local innovation); political
   capital (e.g., lobbying government and local authorities); social
   capital (e.g., collective action); human capital (e.g., local
   leadership); and natural capital (e.g., utilising beach sand) to respond
   to multiple stressors. Nevertheless, in many cases, fishers' responses
   were reactive and led to negative (maladaptive) outcomes. Furthermore,
   this study underscores the importance of critically considering the
   interactive nature of capitals and how they collectively influence
   adaptive capacity in the planning and implementation of adaptation
   research, policy and practice.},

Title = {Urban heat island mitigation strategies: A state-of-the-art review on
   Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {131-145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Observing the rapid urban expansions and numerous infrastructure
   developments in the East-Asian context, many cities are suffering the
   urban heat island (UHI) effect and its associated environmental and
   social challenges. Moreover, the lack of sufficient attention to the
   application of effective heat mitigation strategies in current urban
   development in these cities can drastically intensify the eventual
   impacts of UHI. Therefore, many governmental sectors and policy makers
   have been implementing operative solutions for cooling cities.
   Nevertheless, this study argues that in Kuala Lumpur, despite the
   growing attention to this matter, there is still a need for more
   rigorous consideration by the architecture, engineering and construction
   (AEC) professionals as well as more scholarly studies to reflect
   sustainable solutions to the UHI effect. As a result, today, some of the
   dense urban areas in Kuala Lumpur are characterized with the use of
   thermally massive building materials, urban surfaces with low albedo,
   complex urban morphology, waste heat, and low density of vegetation. On
   the other hand, recent studies demonstrate that there has been a rapidly
   increasing interest in studies related to UHI in other East Asian
   regions such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Hence, this study develops a
   comparative analysis to provide a state-of-the-art review of the recent
   attempts towards mitigating the UHI effect in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore,
   and Hong Kong. Among several available UHI mitigation strategies, this
   study is limited to the analysis of the environmental impacts of urban
   vegetation (green roofs, green facades, vertical greeneries and green
   pavements). Findings reveal that in general, urban greening can
   significantly mitigate the UHI intensity, both directly and indirectly,
   resulting in the decrease of global air temperature and mean radiant
   temperature up to 4 degrees C and 4.5 degrees C respectively. Overall,
   the study develops new practical guidelines, discusses the public
   benefits and elaborates on the future directions of UHI studies. (C)

Title = {A New Digital Twin for Climate Change Adaptation, Water Management, and
   Disaster Risk Reduction (HIP Digital Twin)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the national DK-model hydrological information and
   prediction (HIP) system and HIP portal viewed as a `digital twin' and
   how the introduction of real-time dynamic updating of the DK-model HIP
   simulations can make room for plug-in submodels with real-time boundary
   conditions made available from an HIP portal. The possible feedback to a
   national real-time risk knowledge base during extreme events (flooding
   and drought) is also discussed. Under climate change conditions, Denmark
   is likely to experience more rain in winter, more evapotranspiration in
   summer, intensified cloudbursts, drought, and sea level rise. These
   challenges were addressed as part of the Joint Governmental
   Digitalization Strategy 2016-2020 for better use and sharing of public
   data about the terrain, water, and climate to support climate
   adaptation, water management, and disaster risk reduction. This
   initiative included the development of a new web-based data portal (HIP
   portal) developed by the Danish Agency for Data Supply and
   Infrastructure (SDFI). GEUS delivered 5 terabytes of hydrological model
   data to the portal, with robust calibration methods and hybrid machine
   learning (ML) being key parts of the deliverables. This paper discusses
   the challenges and potentials of further developing the HIP digital twin
   with `plug-in digital twins' for local river basins, including feedback
   to the national level.},

Title = {Exposure of cultural resources to 21st-century climate change: Towards a
   risk management plan},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change during the 21st century presents a
   significant challenge to the protection of cultural resources (CRs) on
   federal lands that encompass \~{} 28\% of the U.S. In particular, CRs on
   this land base may be adversely affected by a wide range of
   climate-change hazards, including damage by sea-level rise, enhanced
   deterioration by increasing temperature and precipitation, and
   destruction by more-frequent and severe wildfire. Most current measures
   to manage the impacts of hazards on CRs use vulnerability assessments,
   but because these require that all CRs be treated as having an equal
   chance of being affected by climate-change hazards (i. e., equal
   exposure) across large landscapes, the cost and resources required for
   such analyses are overwhelming to land management agencies. Projections
   of changes in many hazards, however, show that the probability of hazard
   occurrence will be unevenly distributed on the landscape. Incorporating
   this information into a risk assessment thus allows CR managers to
   prioritize their efforts on assessing impacts to CRs in those areas
   where the probability of the hazard is greatest, thus increasing
   efficiency. We provide several heuristic examples of implementing the
   first part of a CR risk assessment by using 21st-century projections of
   several hazards most likely to adversely affect CRs on nine National
   Forests (NFs) managed by the U.S. Forest Service in northern Idaho and
   Montana. Overlaying the projected distribution of hazards on these NFs
   with the distribution of CRs identifies CR exposure that, with
   information on their vulnerability, is required to determine risk.
   Additional policy and field studies will be needed to determine how to
   prioritize those CRs that are most at risk according to their
   significance as well as identify how impacts can be reduced and managed
   through adaptation planning and implementation. Adaptation will follow
   the iterative risk management process particularly by improving
   projection resolution. Finer scale, process-based modeling informed by
   the highest priority CRs would also provide a means to assess various
   adaptation options that might change the estimated risk and increase the
   odds of CRs being as little affected as possible.},

Title = {Potassium chloride wells used as quick-clay landslide mitigation:
   installation procedures, cost-benefit analysis, and recommendations for
   design},
Journal = {CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL},
Abstract = {Retrogressive development of landslides in highly sensitive clays (quick
   clays) may extend several hundred metres upslope from an initial
   landslide, and liquified slide-debris may impact buildings or
   infrastructure in the run-out zone. By installing wells filled with
   potassium chloride (KCl) in quick clays, the salt migrates into the
   surrounding clay and increases its remolded shear strength, reducing its
   sensitivity. The salt-stabilized, nonquick clay volume may act as a
   barrier preventing backward retrogression, thereby contributing to
   reducing both the area susceptible for being involved in a quick-clay
   landslide, and the area of the run-out zone. Installation procedures and
   design guidelines for salt stabilization are examined herein.
   Installation procedures generating temporary, very small excess
   pore-water pressures were tested at National Geo-Test Site
   Tiller-Flotten. Although the benefit-to-cost ratios related to these
   procedures are small compared to conventional landslide mitigation
   measures, reducing the installation costs to less than 30 USD per m well
   and increasing the center distance between the wells may justify
   salt-stabilization as a landslide mitigation measure. This paper
   describes experience from testing safe installation procedures,
   evaluations of cost-benefit and environmental impact, and proposed
   design guidelines, introducing KCl as an alternative to conventional
   landslide mitigation-measures in slopes with highly sensitive quick-clay
   deposits.},

Title = {A Rising Tide in Bangladesh: livelihood adaptation to climate stress},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {289-307},
Abstract = {Bangladesh is at the forefront of countries experiencing and debating
   climate change, despite having contributed little to global emissions,
   and has the greatest vulnerability to climate change due to inadequate
   institutional support for the dense population dispersed in low-lying
   terrain. A micro-level study of livelihoods in the Panpatti Union, a
   district of the coastal zone exposed to climate stress and an array of
   other social, economic and political stresses, demonstrated that
   adaptation strategies to a range of shocks were both reactive and
   proactive. The persistent nature of shocks, and the limited margins in
   which to respond, meant that achieving sustainable long-term livelihoods
   was unusually difficult. Despite cases of dynamism and flexibility,
   where livelihoods had been effectively diversified, rural people largely
   failed to reduce their exposure to vulnerability. That was especially
   true of extremely poor, landless and female-headed households. In such
   challenging circumstances external interventions were required to ensure
   sustainable development, but were unlikely because of the isolation of
   Panpatti and the number of villages and people in similar circumstances.
   This emphasised the need to develop a more robust livelihoods framework
   to support the most vulnerable communities in severe economic and
   environmental contexts where climate change is likely to exacerbate all
   existing problems.},

Abstract = {Sustainable land-use planning requires decision makers to balance
   community growth with resilience to natural hazards. This balance is
   especially difficult in many coastal communities where planners must
   grapple with significant growth projections, the persistent threat of
   extreme events (e.g., hurricanes), and climate-change-driven sea level
   rise that not only presents a chronic hazard but also alters the spatial
   extent of sudden-onset hazards such as hurricanes. We examine these
   stressors on coastal, long-term land-use planning by reporting the
   results of a one-day community workshop held in Sarasota County, Florida
   that included focus groups and participatory mapping exercises. Workshop
   participants reflected various political agendas and socioeconomic
   interests of five local knowledge domains: business, environment,
   emergency management and infrastructure, government, and planning.
   Through a series of alternating domain-specific focus groups and
   interactive plenary sessions, participants compared the county 2050
   comprehensive land-use plan to maps of contemporary hurricane
   storm-surge hazard zones and projected storm-surge hazard zones enlarged
   by sea level rise scenarios. This interactive, collaborative approach
   provided each group of domain experts the opportunity to combine
   geographically-specific, scientific knowledge on natural hazards and
   climate change with local viewpoints and concerns. Despite different
   agendas, interests, and proposed adaptation strategies, there was common
   agreement among participants for the need to increase community
   resilience to contemporary hurricane storm-surge hazards and to explore
   adaptation strategies to combat the projected, enlarged storm-surge
   hazard zones. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Challenges of implementing integrated coastal zone management into local
   planning policies, a case study of Queensland, Australia},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {75-84},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This review traces an almost 25-year history of implementing
   cornerstones of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and climate
   change adaption into the regulatory planning and decision-making in
   Queensland, Australia. It illustrates the seesawing changes between ICZM
   and the general planning policy and statutory framework to accommodate
   the political struggle of incorporating key climate change adaptation
   measures in sought after and economically important coastal areas. The
   result of this process is mixed. It could be best described as an almost
   total integration of ICZM into, rather than with, other legislation; and
   this has been accompanied by an ever-diminishing political focus on
   coastal management in favour of mostly project specific, generic risk
   and hazard assessment processes. This leaves local authorities with an
   even greater need of reliable and yet affordable scientific and legal
   tools, to effectively deal with these risks. The broader implication of
   the Queensland ICZM history certainly raises the question about the
   extent of integration that is desirable for coastal zone management,
   notably in conjunction with the ongoing debate about climate change
   adaptation. Although the State government has recently introduced a new
   climate change adaptation strategy and is financially supporting coastal
   local government in developing long-term adaptation plans, the concept
   of ICZM in Queensland should be revisited. In other words, there is
   still a need for practical approaches of implementing ICZM into existing
   regulatory planning, pollution control, natural resource management and
   biodiversity conservation frameworks.},

Abstract = {While flood mitigation measures are needed in flood-prone areas, some
   may impact the environment, for example by causing habitat
   fragmentation. As flooding issues nowadays are more complicated and
   should be discussed taking multidisciplinary considerations into
   account, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of land
   use changes on flooding, landscape pattern, and ecological resources as
   a whole, based on past environmental changes and trends in future
   development, using the concept of the Landscape Ecological Decision and
   Evaluation Support System Model (LEDESS).
   Yunlin County, one of the demonstration sites of the Regulation Project
   of Flood-Prone Areas, proposed by the Water Resource Agency of Taiwan in
   2005, was studied. We designed three scenarios, i.e. Scenario A for the
   current situation, Scenario B for the government policy, and Scenario C
   as a sustainable policy integrating room for water. We used people,
   planet, and profit as the indicators to understand the consequences
   under different scenarios. The results indicated that lots of land will
   be abandoned in the near future due to flooding regardless of whether or
   not mitigation measures are adopted. That is to say, the coastal area
   will turn into a wetland area through natural processes. Hence, we need
   to reconsider land use strategy. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {Adaptability, the ability to efficiently adapt to new contexts, is
   necessary for current and future operating forces to successfully
   achieve their missions in complex arenas where problems are shifting
   continuously. The Assessment Toolkit for Leader Adaptability Skills
   (ATLAS) system was the first training system of its kind to aid
   operating forces as they build adaptive expertise by providing a
   validated assessment of adaptability skills targeted at Marine infantry
   squad leaders. The goals for development of the ATLAS system included:
   (1) operationalizing adaptability where the definition included the
   adaptive process within a cognitive framework; (2) assessing
   adaptability in a simulated tactical context; (3) providing diagnostic
   assessment outcomes of adaptability proficiency that support training
   plans and remediation activities where developmental needs are
   identified; (4) delivering a validated, sustainable measurement tool
   that does not require human raters; and (5) supporting an adaptive
   training approach for improving adaptability skills. To date the ATLAS
   effort has achieved these goals through iterative, resource-conscious
   methods of design and development; close collaboration with our subject
   matter expert partners; and field testing with end-user community
   populations. The validated measures of adaptability provide users with
   real-time performance feedback and assessment of adaptive proficiency.
   Future capabilities would extend the benefits of automated adaptability
   measures to provide comparative analysis, robust formative and summative
   feedback, and support improved adaptability proficiency through training
   and remediation recommendations during the Warfighter career continuum.},

Abstract = {Making decisions and efficiently allocating resources to reduce the
   vulnerability of coastal communities requires, among other things, an
   understanding of the factors that make a society vulnerable to climate
   and coastal hazards. One way of doing this is through the analysis of
   spatial data. We demonstrate how to apply GIS methods to spatially
   represent socioeconomic vulnerability in Grenada, a tropical small
   island developing state (SIDS) in the Eastern Caribbean. Our model
   combines spatial features representing variables of social sensitivity,
   community adaptive capacity, and community exposure to flooding in an
   integrated vulnerability index. We draw from the fields of climate
   change adaptation, disaster management, and poverty and development to
   select our variables enabling unique, cross sector, applications of our
   assessment. Mapping our results illustrates that vulnerability to
   flooding is not evenly distributed across the country and is not driven
   by the same factors in all areas of Grenada. This indicates a need for
   the implementation of different strategies in communities across Grenada
   to help effectively reduce vulnerability to climate and coastal hazards.
   The approach presented in this paper can be used to address national
   issues on climate change adaptation, disaster management, and poverty
   and development and more effectively utilize funds in order to reduce
   community vulnerability to natural hazards today and in the future.},

Abstract = {Global warming is a process that is currently happening with little
   doubts. Urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon amplifies its effects by
   additional heat coming from urbanised areas. Its negative effects can
   impact both human health and the comfort of living. European researchers
   include Bucharest UHI among the most intense phenomena on the continent,
   especially during the summer time, when temperature extremes present
   high risk for public health. High intensity of Bucharest UHI urges the
   need of implementation of mitigation measures. Our paper focuses on
   quantification of the contribution of active urban surface to formation
   of UHI, in order to provide adequate input in public policies related to
   extreme heat mitigation. We use hierarchical agglomerative clustering
   and linear regression analysis for measuring the relationship between
   the two variables: density of urban fabric and average monthly
   temperature. Our results reveal that independent variable explains about
   20\% of variation in dependent variable. In addition, we found that
   there is an important effect of scale that makes this relationship
   significant. In such a way, one of the UHI mitigation policies must be
   focused on changing the characteristics of active surface in urbanised
   area.},

Title = {Developing signals to trigger adaptation to sea-level rise},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) is emerging as a
   `fit-for-purpose' method for climate-change adaptation planning to
   address widening future uncertainty and long planning timeframes. A key
   component of DAPP is to monitor indicators of change such as flooding
   and storm events, which can trigger timely adaptive actions (change
   pathway/behavior) ahead of thresholds. Signals and triggers are needed
   to support DAPP-the signal provides early warning of the emergence of
   the trigger (decision-point), and the trigger initiates the process to
   change pathway before a harmful adaptation-threshold is reached. We
   demonstrate a new approach to designing signals and triggers using the
   case of increased flooding as sea level continues to rise. The flooding
   frequency is framed in terms of probable timing of several events
   reaching a specific height threshold within a set monitoring period.
   This framing is well suited to adaptive planning for different hazards,
   because it allows the period over which threshold exceedances are
   monitored to be specified, and thus allows action before
   adaptation-thresholds are reached, while accounting for the potential
   range of timing and providing a probability of premature warning, or of
   triggering adaptation too late. For our New Zealand sea level case
   study, we expect early signals to be observed in 10 year monitoring
   periods beginning 2021. Some urgency is therefore required to begin the
   assessment, planning and community engagement required to develop
   adaptive plans and associated signals and triggers for monitoring.
   Worldwide, greater urgency is required at tide-dominated sites than
   those adapted to large storm-surges. Triggers can be designed with
   confidence that a change in behavior pathway (e.g. relocating
   communities) will be triggered before an adaptation-threshold occurs.
   However, it is difficult to avoid the potential for premature
   adaptation. Therefore, political, social, economic, or cultural signals
   are also needed to complement the signals and triggers based on
   coastal-hazard considerations alone.},

Title = {A system-of-systems framework for exploratory analysis of climate change
   impacts on civil infrastructure resilience},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},

Pages = {175-192},
Abstract = {Climate change has various chronic and acute impacts on civil
   infrastructure systems (CIS). A long-term assessment of resilience in
   CIS requires understanding the transformation of CIS caused by climate
   change stressors and adaptation decision-making behaviors of
   institutional agencies. In addition, resilience assessment for CIS
   includes significant uncertainty regarding future climate change
   scenarios and subsequent impacts. Thus, resilience analysis in CIS under
   climate change impacts need to capture complex adaptive behaviors and
   uncertainty in order to enable robust planning and decision-making. This
   paper presents a system-of-systems (SoS) framework for abstraction and
   integrated modeling of climate change stressors, physical infrastructure
   performance, and institutional actors' decision-making processes. The
   application of the proposed SoS framework is shown in an illustrative
   example related to the impacts of sea level rise and subsequent
   saltwater intrusion on a water system. Through the use of the proposed
   SoS framework, various attributes, processes, and interactions related
   to physical infrastructure and actor's decision-making were abstracted
   and used in the creation of a computational simulation model. Then, the
   computational model was used to simulate various scenarios composed of
   sea level rise and adaptation approaches. Through an exploratory
   analysis approach, the simulated scenario landscape was used to identify
   robust adaptation pathways that lead to a greater system resilience
   under future uncertain sea level rise. The results of the illustrative
   example highlight the various novel capabilities of the SoS framework:
   (i) abstraction of various attributes and processes that affect the
   long-term resilience of infrastructure under climate change; (ii)
   integrated modeling of CIS transformation based on simulating the
   adaptive decision-making processes, physical infrastructure performance,
   and climate change impacts; and (iii) exploratory analysis and
   identification of robust pathways for adaptation to climate change
   impacts.},

Abstract = {Drought risk analysis can help improve disaster management techniques,
   thereby reducing potential drought risk under the impacts of climate
   change. This study analyses observed and model-simulated spatial
   patterns of changes in drought risk in vulnerable eco-regions in China
   during 1988-2017 and 2020-2050 using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
   method. To perform a risk assessment and estimation of a drought
   disaster, three subsystems-namely hazard, vulnerability and exposure-are
   assessed in terms of the effects of climate change since the middle of
   the 21st century: (i) Hazards, represented by climate anomalies related
   to the drought process, such as changes in rainfall averages,
   temperature averages and evaporation averages; (ii) vulnerability,
   encompassing land use and mutual transposition between them; (iii)
   exposure, consisting of socioeconomic, demographic, and farming. The
   results demonstrated that high hazards continue to be located in the
   arid zone, high vulnerability levels occur in the Junggar Basin and
   Inner Mongolia Plateau, and high exposure levels occur Loess Plateau and
   southern coastal area. In this way, the results provide exhaustive
   measures for proactive drought risk management and mitigation

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {The rate of change on coastlines is accelerating from climate change and
   coastal development. Coastal flooding is a particularly pressing and
   increasing problem, which affects hundreds of millions of people and
   damages trillions of US\$ in property. Scientists, practitioners and
   managers must be able to quickly assess flood risk and identify
   appropriate adaptation and risk reduction measures often with limited
   data and tools, particularly in developing countries. To inform these
   decision-making processes, we identify how sensitive flood risk and
   adaptation analyses are to changes in the resolution of data and models.
   We further do these comparisons in the context of assess the benefits of
   an ecosystem-based approach for risk reduction. There is growing
   interest in these ecosystem-based approaches as cost effective measures
   for adaptation and risk reduction. We assess flood risks from tropical
   cyclones and the flood risk reduction benefits provided by mangroves in
   Pagbilao (the Philippines). Then, we also compare risks and risk
   reduction (benefits) using different quality data and models, to
   identify where to invest in in new modeling and data acquisition to
   improve decision-making. We find that coastal flood risk valuation
   improves by using high resolution topography and long time series of
   data on tropical cyclones, while flood reduction benefits of mangroves
   are better valued by using consistent databases and models along the
   whole process rather than investing in single measures.},

Abstract = {The world population is expected to increase by a further three billion
   by 2050 and 90\% of the three billion will be from developing countries
   that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being
   of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in
   its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate
   system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The
   atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have
   diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has
   been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding
   decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean
   surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming
   of 0.85 degrees C (0.65-1.06 degrees C) over the period of 1880-2012.
   World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year
   on record.
   Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South
   Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task
   of feeding 17.5\% of the global population with only 2.4\% of land and
   4\% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to
   climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on
   agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively
   weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100
   years has indicated an increase of 0.6 degrees C, which is likely to
   impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of
   millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on
   yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased
   temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days.
   Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term
   (2020-39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by
   4.5-9\%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since
   agriculture currently contributes about 15\% of India's gross domestic
   product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate
   change to roughly range from 0.7\% to 1.35\% of GDP per year.
   Indian agriculture, with 80\% of farmers being smallholders (<0.5 ha)
   having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed
   agriculture (58\%), about 30\% of population undernourished, migration
   from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more
   vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the
   past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased,
   with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent
   cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become
   common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion.
   Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops,
   fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer,
   forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors
   were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor.
   Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring
   food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor,
   small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the
   absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate
   change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India,
   the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be
   over \$ 7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10\%
   of the population.
   However, this could be reduced by 80\%, if cost-effective climate
   resilient measures are implemented.
   Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity
   and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also
   reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient
   agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and
   resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the
   system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting
   damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such
   as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest
   outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is
   the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves
   judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water,
   soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices.
   CRA is a way to achieve short-and long-term agricultural development
   priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other
   development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors
   in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to
   enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and
   incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals,
   (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems
   to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate
   emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration.
   These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are
   referred to as the ``triple win{''} of overall CRA.
   The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by
   Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and
   household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in
   the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods,
   hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of
   CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize
   and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and
   recover from climate risks.
   The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village level
   institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC),
   custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and
   fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based
   on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in
   decision making on institutional requirements, technological
   interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In
   our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate
   Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program
   involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate
   change adaptation anywhere in the world.
   Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program
   at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization
   (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the
   district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under
   the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of
   Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for
   Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology
   divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are
   responsible in implementing the project at village level through
   farmers' participatory approach.
   To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages,
   different interventions were planned under the four modules; however,
   the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was
   need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource
   situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being
   implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture
   conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management,
   soil health card-based nutrient application, water harvesting and
   recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage
   in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water
   saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of
   introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties,
   modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to
   cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of
   Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in
   fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in
   onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village CHC
   with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window,
   location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry
   systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions
   through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods,
   prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in
   livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and
   excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy.
   (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective
   marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate
   literacy though establishment of automated weather stations.
   Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were
   assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved
   farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village
   level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon
   sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and
   measurements of GHG emissions which were correlated with ex ante
   assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to
   global warming potential.
   These 151 CRVs are learning sites for further expanding resilient
   villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of
   villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change
   mitigation mission in the country.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses climate-development linkages, with a focus on
   developing countries but also drawing lessons from the experiences of
   developed countries. Increases in weather and climate extremes leading
   to natural disasters have been observed in recent decades. Such events
   are impeding economic and social development in developing countries, as
   are socio-economic changes that increase their exposure and as well as
   the likelihood of mal-adaptation. For the Pacific Islands region, the
   most recent decade has been somewhat anomalous, with the marked absence
   of El Nino conditions resulting in fewer people being affected by
   natural disasters. Further increases in these extreme events are
   anticipated as a result of global warming, imposing still further
   barriers to sustainable development. However, integrating appropriate
   adaptation measures, including disaster risk-reduction measures, into
   development policies and plans provides developing countries with the
   opportunity to reduce socio-economic risks associated with extreme
   weather and climate events. This will help ensure the longer-term
   viability of development, despite a changing climate. Emphasis should be
   on no-regrets interventions.},

Title = {Strategic discarding reduces seabird numbers and contact rates with
   trawl fishery gears in the Southwest Atlantic},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {266},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Incidental mortality in trawl fisheries is a serious threat to seabird
   sustainability. Driven primarily by seabirds attracted to discards,
   limiting discard discharge through strategic batching is a best practice
   mitigation measure recommended by the Agreement on the Conservation of
   Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). However, studies supporting the efficacy
   of batch discarding are rare, limited to the south-western Pacific, and
   assess seabird numbers attending vessels only, not gear contact rates.
   The effectiveness of batch discarding in areas with different seabird
   communities, fishery assemblages, and natural prey availability is
   therefore unknown. Here we quantify both seabird numbers and gear
   contact rates in response to strategic discard discharge in the Falkland
   Islands trawl fleet for two high-risk species groups: black-browed
   albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and giant petrel species
   (Macronectes spp.). Specifically, we test the effect of three different
   discharge treatments (zero, batch and continuous discarding) at two
   vessels. Bird abundance and contact rates were positively related, but
   zero discarding consistently reduced seabird numbers attending trawlers
   and eliminated contacts with warp cables and tori-lines. Batching
   significantly reduced bird abundance and contact rates at the vessel
   that stored all discards between batches. At the other vessel, however,
   intermittent release of hashed viscera diminished the mitigation effect.
   Our findings validate the generality of batch discarding as an effective
   mitigation measure in trawl fisheries where zero discarding is not
   possible, whilst highlighting the importance of complete waste storage.},

Journal = {WATER POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {10-30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Asia-Pacific region is extremely vulnerable to climate variability
   and change. This reflects high exposure to hydroclimatic hazards such as
   tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and heatwaves. Rapidly growing
   cities and low-lying coastal zones/estuaries also face threats from sea
   level rise and storm surges. However, climate model projections remain
   very uncertain about most of these risks, so water infrastructure and
   operations need to consider a range of plausible futures. Against this
   background, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been developing
   frameworks, tools, and capacities in climate risk and adaptation
   assessment and management. Project teams are often operating in
   data-scarce situations and under significant time constraints, so the
   emphasis has been on creating pragmatic guidance and training resources.
   This paper charts the transition of climate risk management (CRM) within
   the ADB from a predominantly scenario-led to decision-led approach to
   adaptation. Examples are given of light-touch procedures for screening
   climate risks, strengthening the transparency and rigour of scenario
   analysis, raising awareness of a broad range of adaptation options,
   streamlining identification of CRM options, and embedding allowances for
   climate change in detailed engineering designs. Such practical
   innovations would benefit communities of practice beyond the
   Asia-Pacific region.},

Series = {Regional Climate Studies},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {475-488},
Abstract = {Climate change will have important impacts on the North Sea coastal
   zones. Major threats include sea-level rise and the associated increase
   in flood risk, coastal erosion and wetland loss, and hazards arising
   from more frequent storm surges. The North Sea countries-Belgium,
   Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the
   UK-have developed strategies to deal with these threats. This chapter
   provides a short introduction to the present adaptation strategies and
   highlights differences and similarities between them. All the North Sea
   countries face dilemmas in the implementation of their adaptation
   strategies. Uncertainty about the extent and timing of climate-driven
   impacts is a major underlying cause. In view of this, adaptation plans
   focus on no-regret measures. The most considered measures in the North
   Sea countries are spatial planning in the coastal zone (set-back lines),
   wetland restoration, coastal nourishment and reinforcement of existing
   protection structures. The difficulty of identifying the climate-driven
   component of observed change in the coastal zone is a critical obstacle
   to obtaining a widely shared understanding of the urgency of adaptation.
   A better coordinated and more consistent approach to marine monitoring
   is crucial for informing policy and the general public and for
   developing the adaptive capacity of institutions and wider society. A
   dedicated coastal observation network is not yet in place in the North
   Sea region.},

Title = {Arsenic Aquifer Sealing Technology in Wells: A Sustainable Mitigation
   Option},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {225},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The act of constructing unprotected/unsealed wells to extract water from
   deep aquifers is a worrisome ongoing practice in most parts of
   developing countries of the globe. The paper is first of its kind in
   exploring sealing technology as a potential mitigation measure to
   prevent arsenic contamination of deep aquifers. The technology has been
   assessed not only as a safeguard to potential microbiological or
   mineralogical contamination of aquifers but also as an adaptive option
   in case of climate-induced disasters like drought or flood where it can
   serve as emergency safe drinking water source. This paper puts forward
   comparative findings of mini-arsenic blanket testing of 358 wells
   (unsealed) performed at an interval of 8 years in Nawalparasi, district
   of Nepal, along with the performance monitoring of eight different
   sealed wells ranging from 20 to 80 m deep for over a period of 7 years.
   The paper focuses on the construction methodology and performance
   evaluation of four sealed shallow wells constructed in the same
   district. Mini-arsenic blanket test results show 38, 37, and 25 \% of
   bore wells with respective increasing, decreasing, and constant level of
   arsenic concentrations whereas the sealed wells exhibit steadiness in
   arsenic concentration range of particular tapped aquifers within Nepal
   drinking water quality standard for arsenic of 50 mu g/l over a long
   period, even though the tapped aquifers lie intercepted in between
   adjacent arsenic elevated aquifers. Sealed shallow wells exhibit good
   aquifer seal characteristics beyond potential resultant existing
   positive difference to cause downward aquifer cross-contamination. The
   presented technology can be used and replicated in deep/multi-aquifer
   hydrogeology of Nepal and South Asia for extraction of water from deep
   and safer aquifers in rural and urban water supply systems by escaping
   overlying arsenic-contaminated aquifers.},

Abstract = {Managing to support coral reef resilience as the climate changes
   requires strategic and responsive actions that reduce anthropogenic
   stress. Managers can only target and tailor these actions if they
   regularly receive information on system condition and impact severity.
   In large coral reef areas like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
   (GBRMP), acquiring condition and impact data with good spatial and
   temporal coverage requires using a large network of observers. Here, we
   describe the result of similar to 10 years of evolving and refining
   participatory monitoring programs used in the GBR that have rangers,
   tourism operators and members of the public as observers. Participants
   complete Reef Health and Impact Surveys (RHIS) using a protocol that
   meets coral reef managers' needs for up-to-date information on the
   following: benthic community composition, reef condition and impacts
   including coral diseases, damage, predation and the presence of rubbish.
   Training programs ensure that the information gathered is sufficiently
   precise to inform management decisions. Participants regularly report
   because the demands of the survey methodology have been matched to their
   time availability. Undertaking the RHIS protocol we describe involves
   three similar to 20 min surveys at each site. Participants enter data
   into an online data management system that can create reports for
   managers and participants within minutes of data being submitted. Since
   2009, 211 participants have completed a total of more than 10,415
   surveys at more than 625 different reefs. The two-way exchange of
   information between managers and participants increases the capacity to
   manage reefs adaptively, meets education and outreach objectives and can
   increase stewardship. The general approach used and the survey
   methodology are both sufficiently adaptable to be used in all reef
   regions.},

Title = {Repetitive floods intensify outmigration and climate gentrification in

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {Recent floods in America, Europe, Asia and Africa reminded societies
   across the world of the need to revisit their climate adaptation
   strategies. Rapid urbanization coinciding with a growing frequency and
   intensity of floods requires transformative actions in cities worldwide.
   While abandoning flood prone areas is sometimes discussed as a public
   climate adaptation option, little attention is paid to studying
   cumulative impacts of outmigration as an individual choice. To explore
   the aggregated consequences of households' outmigration decisions in
   response to increasing flood hazards, we employ a computational
   agent-based model grounded in empirical heuristics of buyers' and
   sellers' behaviour in a flood-prone housing market. Our results suggest
   that pure market-driven processes can cause shifts in demographics in
   climate-sensitive hotspots placing low-income households further at
   risk. They get trapped in hazard zones, even when individual risk
   perceptions and behavioural location preferences are independent of
   income, suggesting increasing climate gentrification as an outcome of
   market sorting.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {41-50},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Overwhelming evidence has shown that, from the Industrial Revolution to
   the present, human activities influence ground-level ozone (O-3)
   concentrations. Past studies demonstrate links between O-3 exposure and
   health. However, knowledge gaps remain in our understanding concerning
   the impacts of climate change mitigation policies on O-3 concentrations
   and health. Using a hybrid downscaling approach, we evaluated the
   separate impact of climate change and emission control policies on O-3
   levels and associated excess mortality in the US in the 2050s under two
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We show that, by the
   2050s, under RCP4.5, increased O-3 levels due to combined climate change
   and emission control policies, could contribute to an increase of
   approximately 50 premature deaths annually nationwide in the US. The
   biggest impact, however, is seen under RCP8.5, where rises in O-3
   concentrations are expected to result in over 2,200 additional premature
   deaths annually. The largest increases in O-3 are seen in RCP8.5 in the
   Northeast, the Southeast, the Central, and the West regions of the US.
   Additionally, when O-3 increases are examined by climate change and
   emissions contributions separately, the benefits of emissions mitigation
   efforts may significantly outweigh the effects of climate change
   mitigation policies on O-3-related mortality.},

Title = {Flood vulnerability among rural households in the Red River Delta of
   Vietnam: implications for future climate change risk and adaptation},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Pages = {465-492},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Red River Delta (RRD) of Vietnam, one of the world's most densely
   populated deltas, is already vulnerable to flooding events, and climate
   change forecasts project increased exposure to flood risk in coming
   decades due to changes in rainfall, storm intensity and frequency, and
   sea-level rise. However, there is a relative neglect of this region in
   the literature on natural hazards and climate change, particularly on
   how floods in the RRD might affect poor people and different livelihood
   sectors, how flood risk is understood and acted on, and how flood
   impacts experienced by households influence local adaptation choices.
   This article presents research undertaken in 2009-2010 to understand the
   impacts of flooding in a typical rural zone (Thai Binh Province) of the
   RRD to assess overall vulnerability, particularly the relationship
   between poverty, livelihoods, and flood impacts, as well as to assess
   the range of adaptation and flood risk reduction options currently used.
   Our findings indicate that while poor households do not appear to be
   more exposed to floods than others, their incomes are more sensitive to
   relative impacts from floods. Yet poverty alone did not explain flood
   vulnerability, as age of household and livelihood sector involvement
   showed stronger relationships to flood impacts. Flood risk perceptions
   were also uneven, but poor people did not seem to take less proactive
   flood risk reduction measures than others. There are few long-term
   adaptation actions to flooding being taken by households of any income
   class, and there is a need for better community and government aid after
   flood events to help households cope with increased flood risks in the
   RRD, rather than relying on improvements in hard infrastructure, as is
   currently the dominant approach in the region, particularly given future
   forecasts of increased rainfall for northern Vietnam under climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Small Island States are the most exposed and vulnerable to the impacts
   of climate change, particularly sea level rise. Unfortunately,
   mitigation measures, building capacity for the vulnerable groups, or
   even the adoption of adaptation measures may not be a sufficient
   solution. Instead, resettlement outside their country of origin may in
   some instances, be the only alternative. With resettlement however comes
   other issues, not least are the grounds under which they might qualify
   for another country's protection. In this article, we examine the case
   of Ioane Teitiota, who in 2013 applied to Immigration New Zealand for
   refugee status under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
   as a `climate change refugee'. His application was refused because he
   failed to meet the current criteria required to demonstrate refugee
   status. Teitiota's case, reflects what appears to be the dominant
   situation of displaced peoples who apply for refugee status on the
   ground of the impacts of climate change. Aside from the Convention, it
   is questionable whether the rights of people affected by climate change
   are protected under international law. There are a number of solutions
   mooted for resolution of the issue of climate displacement however as
   yet, none have gained international agreement.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise and an increase in typhoon intensity are two of the
   expected consequences from future climate change. In the present work, a
   methodology to change the intensity of tropical cyclones in Japan was
   developed, which can be used to assess the inundation risk to different
   areas of the country. As a result, the probability of a storm with an
   equivalent return period in the year 2100 to that of the worst storm in
   the 20th century overcoming sea defences around Tokyo Bay could be
   calculated. The risk of higher storm surges, coupled with different
   sea-level-rise scenarios, highlights how the dykes around Tokyo or
   Kawasaki could fail unless adaptation measures against climate change
   are attempted. The cost of adapting to both of these effects by building
   higher coastal dykes and raising port areas outside them was quantified.
   Finally, an estimation of the cost of allowing the areas behind the
   defences to be flooded was also made, clearly showing that the cost of
   adaptation measures is clearly lower than the cost of inaction.},

Abstract = {Hazards to roadways and travelers can be drastically different because
   hazards are largely dependent on the regional environment and climate.
   This paper describes the development of a qualitative method for
   assessing infrastructure importance and hazard exposure for rural
   highway segments in Hawai'i under different conditions. Multiple
   indicators of roadway importance are considered, including traffic
   volume, population served, accessibility, connectivity, reliability,
   land use, and roadway connection to critical infrastructures, such as
   hospitals and police stations. The method of evaluating roadway hazards
   and importance can be tailored to fit different regional hazard
   scenarios. It assimilates data from diverse sources to estimate risks of
   disruption. A case study for Highway HI83 in Hawai'i, which is exposed
   to multiple hazards, is conducted. Weakening of the road by coastal
   erosion, inundation from sea level rise, and rockfall hazards require
   adaptation solutions. By analyzing the risk of disruption to highway
   segments, adaptation approaches can be prioritized. Using readily
   available geographic information system data sets for the exposure and
   impacts of potential hazards, this method could be adapted not only for
   emergency management but also for planning, design, and engineering of
   resilient highways.},

Abstract = {The premise is presented that durable adaptive responses may be
   developed within fish populations on much more rapid time scales (e.g.,
   5-50 yrs) than possible via classical genetics-based Darwinian
   evolution. If so, there are major implications for the way we may view
   fish population dynamics. For example, any degree of understanding of
   the adaptive mechanisms involved, or even a well-founded belief that
   such mechanisms are operating, would open up a broad range of new
   considerations for adaptive management responses, design of mitigation
   actions, and foresight as to the nature and course of climatic or
   anthropogenic impacts. There is even reason to think that such
   rapidly-evolving response processes operating within exploited resource
   populations could cause some conventional fishery management responses
   to be absolutely wrong (e.g., serving to trap and maintain the
   populations within low-productivity phases). Moreover, unless the
   mechanisms involved are understood, it may be very difficult to ever
   sort out, understand, and adequately allow for the interacting effects
   of low frequency climate variability. In order to have a concrete basis
   for illustrating and exploring these issues, the operation of one
   potential mechanism of this type, the ``school-mix feedback{''}
   mechanism, is outlined through the use of simple diagrammatic cartoons.
   These are intended to quickly impart a general degree of understanding
   of the operation of this particular mechanism and the likelihood that it
   must operate at least to some degree in real ocean systems. More
   generally, they may serve to illustrate the natural function of
   mechanisms of this type in preserving the populations that may employ
   them, and of the manner in which their operation might affect: (1) the
   efficacy of fishery management actions, and (2) the interpretation of
   empirical climate-fisheries relationships and their potential utility as
   bases for forecasts and management responses. Possibilities for
   innovative adaptive management actions are suggested.},

Abstract = {Cities in the USA and around the world have begun to take an active role
   in responding to climate change. A central requirement for effective
   urban climate strategies is the capacity to understand and measure how
   the climate is changing, the physical, environmental, and social impacts
   of the changes, and whether adaptation and resiliency policies and
   programs put in place in response are working. The objective of this
   paper is to review and assess how urban climate change and resiliency
   efforts can be measured and to define what might serve as meaningful
   indicator and monitoring protocols. The New York City Panel on Climate
   Change (NPCC) is used as a case study along with a reviews of the
   emerging literature of urban climate change indicators to analyze the
   requirements and processes needed for a successful urban climate
   resiliency indicator and monitoring (I and M) system. In the paper, the
   basic requirements of a proposed Urban Climate Resilience Indicators and
   Monitoring System are presented. A specific illustration of an I and M
   system for tracking the urban heat island highlights challenges as well
   as potential solutions embedded within such systems. Discussions how
   these protocols can be translated to other locales and settings, as well
   as the relationship to the US National Climate Assessment indicator
   process, are presented.},

Title = {Towards a heuristic for assessing adaptation knowledge: impacts,
   implications, decisions and actions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change poses a significant challenge to primary industries and
   adaptation will be required to reduce detrimental impacts and realise
   opportunities. Despite the breadth of information to support adaptation
   planning however, knowledge is fragmented, obscuring information needs,
   hampering strategic planning and constraining decision-making
   capacities. In this letter, we present and apply the Adaptation
   Knowledge Cycle (AKC), a heuristic for rapidly evaluating and
   systematising adaptation research by analytical foci: Impacts,
   Implications, Decisions or Actions. We demonstrate its application
   through an assessment of ten years' climate change adaptation research
   for New Zealand's primary industries. The letter draws on the results of
   systematic review, empirical analysis, workshops, interviews, narrative
   analyses and pathways planning to synthesise information and identify
   knowledge gaps. Results show the heuristic's simplicity is valuable for
   cross- and transdisciplinary communication on adaptation in New
   Zealand's primary industries. Results also provide insight into what we
   know and need to know with respect to undertaking adaptation planning.
   With the development of tools and processes to inform decision making
   under conditions of uncertainty- such as adaptation pathways-it is
   increasingly important to efficiently and accurately determine knowledge
   needs. The combination of systematic data collection techniques, and
   heuristics such as the AKC may provide researchers and stakeholders with
   an efficient, robust tool to review and synthesise existing knowledge,
   and identify emerging research priorities. Results can in turn support
   the design of targeted research and inform adaptation strategies for
   policy and practice.},

Abstract = {Kiribati, a small Pacific island nation, is at severe risk of climate
   change. The geography and historic, linear development of its capital on
   the South Tawara atoll mean that many key public assets are at risk from
   impacts of coastal erosion and thus vulnerable to climate-change
   effects. An adaptation project started in 2003, which included
   developing a means of assessing coastal vulnerability and a process for
   proactive management of the coast. Guidelines offering alternatives to
   traditional coastal engineering methods were provided, and practical
   application of these guidelines was demonstrated at selected high-risk
   pilot sites in 2006-2010. Appropriate technology for increasing
   resilience was shown through application of simple but effective tools
   to identify and select adaptation options; recognition that customary
   responses ingrained over lifetimes will not be changed by a short-term
   project; and use of tried-and-tested quality improvements to traditional
   construction techniques. Rather than introducing completely new and
   unfamiliar measures, the pilot works enhanced and built on existing
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Arctic coasts are likely to become one of the most impacted environments
   of the Earth under changing climate conditions. Under most scenarios,
   the Arctic is predicted to experience the strongest air and sea
   temperature increase on the surface of the Earth. As a result, the
   lengthening open-water season and the increasing open-water area, due to
   the decline of sea ice extent, will induce changes to the length of the
   fetch and allow storms to hit the coasts further in the fall season.
   Alas, Arctic coasts remain largely unknown and unexplored, which puts
   current mitigation and adaptation strategies in northern communities
   into jeopardy. Less than 1\% of the Arctic coastlines have been studied
   to quantify coastline evolution at a detailed level. Remote sensing is
   probably the most adapted solution to coastline studies in the Arctic,
   offering vast possibilities to offset the remoteness and harshness of
   the region. Research has been particularly innovative in drawing
   information from a wide variety of sensors for applications related to
   the Arctic coastal zone, including long-term coastline evolution, but
   also flooding, nearshore bathymetry and extreme event impact
   assessments. This chapter attempts at providing a review of past and
   current efforts to depict arctic coastline evolution. It highlights the
   concurrent improvements of techniques and results, in particular, the
   recent dramatic increase in high resolution imagery availability and
   draws perspectives on future challenges to encompass the wide variety of
   processes specific to arctic coastlines in remote sensing studies.
   Observation scenarios are put in the context of the consolidation of
   observing efforts through coordinated international observation programs
   such as SAON and GEOSS.},

Title = {A conceptual model-based approach to explore community livelihood
   adaptation under uncertainty for adaptive delta management},

Abstract = {Delta communities worldwide are facing a multitude of challenges in
   their life and livelihood. In many developing countries, improving the
   quality of life and livelihood is a key challenge. While development is
   a central goal of delta planning in such countries, the effectiveness of
   planning is challenged by uncertain changes in climate and
   socio-economy. Bangladesh (one of the countries) is moving towards the
   adaptive delta management approach to deal with such uncertainties.
   Historical examples illustrate that Community Livelihood Adaptation
   (CLA) can critically influence the effectiveness of a policy strategy.
   Therefore, there is a clear need to explore CLA under uncertainty. For
   that purpose, this paper develops and applies a conceptual model-based
   approach combining the mental model and scenarios techniques. Our
   approach starts by using a participatory process to elicit mental models
   a farmers' community uses when considering adaptation decisions; we
   capture these in the form of a cognitive map, and this map can serve as
   a conceptual model for analyzing livelihood adaptation decision-making
   in a future-oriented scenario analysis. To illustrate the approach, a
   case study of cropping decision-making of farmers community at a polder
   location under the saline condition in the southwest of Bangladesh has
   been elaborated. Results show that the approach is useful in structuring
   the cognitive and qualitative nature of complex decision-making process,
   and helps in understanding the dynamic interactions of farmers'
   adaptation decisions with other actors, their environmental attributes,
   and market traits. It can help policymakers anticipate the adaptation
   direction of policy strategies.},

Title = {Main Threats in Mediterranean Coastal Wetlands. The Ebro Delta Case},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that exist at the interface
   between land and sea. They represent environments with a great diversity
   of habitats and communities, high carbon sequestration capacity and a
   wide range of ecosystem services. In the Mediterranean, the largest
   coastal wetlands are found in deltaic areas like that of the Ebro River
   (Spain), which has a coastline length of approximately 50 km, occupying
   a total area of 325 km(2). The Ebro Delta is included in different
   national and international frameworks for environmental conservation,
   despite which there are several risks that threaten it. The lack of
   sedimentary contributions due to the regulation of the Ebro riverbed
   (irrigation, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power generation) has caused
   erosion and the retreat of certain sections of its coastline. To this
   situation of sediment deficit must be added the threat posed by the
   effects of global change, such as the rise in sea level, the increase in
   temperature and in the frequency and intensity of storms. This study
   analyses the particularities of the coastal wetland of the Ebro Delta,
   identifying the main threats it faces, as well as possible adaptation
   and mitigation strategies to these changes.},

Abstract = {Climate change is an inevitable event that obstructs the output of
   aquaculture farms and culture-based fisheries in open waters. It poses a
   serious threat to global food security, altering biodiversity,
   ecosystems, and global fish output by displacing fish stocks from their
   natural habitats. When compared to freshwater aquaculture,
   marine/coastal aquaculture is more affected. To combat the effects of
   climate change, several mitigation methods and adaptations are being
   implemented, emphasizing future demands of affordable protein. Selective
   breeding, species diversification, and aquaculture systems like
   integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, aquaponics, and recirculating
   aquaculture system are some of the most widely accepted and adapted
   solutions. Further research on intervention in seed and feed in terms of
   quality improvement, bioresource utilization, and technological and
   genetic improvement is required. Climate change policies from the
   government are also essential. The present study differs from previous
   reviews by portraying the various abiotic stress factors contributing to
   the drastic climate change, encompassing adaptation strategies followed
   in distinct aquaculture sources such as freshwater, inland saline water,
   brackish water, coastal waters, and culture-based capture fisheries with
   its future implications.},

Abstract = {There are numerous instances of the abuse and overexploitation of
   natural resources held in common. This is especially true in marine
   environments. In a well-known article, Garrett Hardin states that the
   exploitation of common property resources will inevitably lead to
   ecological deterioration. Critics maintain that his proposition is based
   on false assumptions and is empirically untenable. They present examples
   of sustainable use and successful communal resource management. In my
   opinion, the pessimistic and the optimistic views are both flawed.
   Understanding the motives and behaviour of commoners requires a close
   examination of their adaptive strategies, socially and culturally
   contextualized in a long-term perspective. From this angle, this article
   focuses on Texel fishermen's adaptations in the nineteenth and early
   twentieth centuries.},

Abstract = {Starting from some key outcomes of the first agreement on the Protocol
   on ICZM (Integrated Coastal Zone Management) in the Mediterranean Region
   recently signed in Madrid, the paper seeks to contribute to an
   evaluation of what the application of climate change adaptation policies
   along Italian coasts really could mean.
   This research aims to provide a concrete comparison between the present
   coastal land use and substantive obligations stated in the Protocol.
   Among these, we have mainly considered building limitations in an area
   of at least one hundred metres from the sea. In this context, the paper
   analyses the present land use and its spatial features regarding the
   coastal vulnerability to climate change and the feasibility of
   adaptation strategies.
   An index-based evaluation of the aptness of application of the Protocol
   along Italian coasts has been prepared, showing substantial differences
   in regional potential.
   The research presents methods to select zones where the Protocol could
   be applied and used to consider non-standard solutions, such as
   converting the impact of the railways into a coastal protection
   perspective.
   This study intends to offer a concrete stimulus for a national coastal
   adaptation programme that is still lacking in Italy, suggesting
   innovative methods for a national comparison of regional particularities
   regarding coastal adaptation.},

Abstract = {We analyzed two historical extreme heat events in Los Angeles to explore
   the potential of increasing vegetative cover and surface solar
   reflectance (albedo) to reduce total exposure (indoor and outdoor) to
   dangerously hot conditions. We focus on three population subgroups, the
   elderly, office workers, and outdoor workers, and explore the extreme
   case where each subgroup does not have functioning air conditioning in
   their residences. For each heat event, we conducted atmospheric model
   simulations for a control case and four mitigation cases with varying
   levels of increased albedo and vegetation cover. Simultaneously, we
   conducted building simulations of representative residential buildings
   that lacked mechanical air conditioning. These simulations factored in
   both the indirect cooling effects associated with neighborhood
   implementation of mitigation strategies and the direct effects of high
   albedo roofing on the individual buildings. From both the atmospheric
   and building models, we exported hourly values of air temperature and
   dew point temperature, and used this information in combination with
   various scenarios of occupant behavior to create profiles of individual
   heat exposure. We also gathered heat-mortality data for the two heat
   events and developed a synoptic climatology-based relationship between
   exposure and excess mortality. This relationship was then applied to the
   scenarios in which albedo and canopy cover were increased. The results
   suggest that improvements in indoor thermal conditions are responsible
   for a sizable portion of the health benefit of large-scale
   implementation of heat mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Due to flat terrain and dense population, the Bengal Delta is highly
   vulnerable to sea level rise. At present the delta building process is
   active in the Meghna Estuary. Information on sediment dispersal
   processes in the estuary and their response to different exogenic and
   anthropogenic forces is an important requirement for managing the
   sediment and developing adaptive measures to counter the potential
   impact of climate change. Historical maps, satellite images and tidal
   water level data were analysed and the response of the Meghna Estuary to
   extreme events, e.g. the 1950 Assam earthquake, as well as anthropogenic
   interventions, was assessed. The issue of sediment management was
   addressed, based on an understanding of the response of the estuary to
   the extreme natural event and anthropogenic interventions, along with an
   assessment of the response of the estuary to sea level rise. Among other
   interventions, emphasis has been directed to promoting vertical
   accretion by injecting sediment into polders.},

Abstract = {This work provides an overview of the literature on the current and
   projected social and health effects of climate change in countries
   affected by sub-Antarctic atmospheric circulation, including Argentina,
   Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa. These countries, which
   for convenience we gloss as `40 South', are already experiencing
   considerable impact. Climate change particularly impacts on water and
   food security, extreme weather events and migration. Projections
   indicate that the continuing impact of climate change may precipitate
   political and socioeconomic crises, including increased local, regional,
   and international migration. We highlight the similarity of the
   countries in terms of geography, current, and projected climate change
   impacts, adopted mitigation and adaptation strategies, and vulnerable
   population groups. While the health and social consequences of climate
   change draw attention to the differences in the social, political, and
   economic differences between the countries, we argue the strategic and
   scientific value of comparisons between them. (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Container terminals are the main hubs of the global supply chain but,
   conversely, they play an important role in energy consumption,
   environmental pollution and even climate change due to carbon emissions.
   Assessing the environmental impact of this type of port terminal and
   choosing appropriate mitigation measures is essential to pursue the
   goals related to a clean environment and ensuring a good quality of life
   of the inhabitants of port cities. In this paper the authors present a
   Terminal Decision Support Tool (TDST) for the development of a container
   terminal that considers both operation efficiency and environmental
   impacts. The TDST provides environmental impact mitigation measures
   based on different levels of evolution of the port's container traffic.
   An application of the TDST is conducted on the Port of Augusta (Italy),
   a port that is planning infrastructural interventions in coming years in
   order to gain a new role as a reference point for container traffic in
   the Mediterranean.},

Title = {Assessing Future Flood Hazards for Adaptation Planning in a Northern
   European Coastal Community},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {From a transdisciplinary approach in the town of Thyboron, Denmark, we
   investigate couplings between sea state (i.e., mean and extreme) and
   flooding hazards today and ahead. This includes analyses of change and
   variability in the groundwater table, precipitation, land motion,
   geotechnical ground properties, sewerage systems and other
   infrastructure to outline a more complete platform for the integration
   of knowledge into climate adaptation schemes at this highly vulnerable
   coastal location. It involves the engagement of the main stakeholders
   who, although having different responsibilities, interests, needs of
   knowledge and data, and different timeframes for investment and
   planning, must join in a common appraisal of the challenges faced ahead
   to provide for better adaptation measures. Apart from obvious adverse
   effects from future storm surge events, knowledge about the coupled
   effects of the abovementioned parameters needs to be taken into account
   to reach optimal mitigation and adaptation measures. Through stakeholder
   interviews it becomes clear that an enhanced focus on transdisciplinary
   research is a viable way forward to develop such measures: it will bring
   in more knowledge, a broader scope, and it will provide for more
   holistic solutions that both serve to protect the town and allow for
   business development and better municipal planning ahead.},

Abstract = {The study aimed to assess the changes in urban areas and UHI effects in
   Dhaka city, Bangladesh, from 2001 to 2017, using Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily day- and nighttime land surface
   temperature (LST) data from 2001 to 2017. The expansion of the city was
   calculated using the city clustering algorithm (CCA). The temperature of
   the identified urbanized area was analyzed and compared with the
   adjacent regions. The changes in urban temperature were estimated using
   non-parametric statistical methods. The results showed that Dhaka city's
   land surface area has grown by 25.33\% and its inhabitants by 76.65\%
   during 2001-2017. Urban expansion and dense settlements caused an
   increase in average temperature in some areas of Dhaka city nearly 3
   degrees C compared to that at its boundary. The day and night
   temperature differences at Dhaka city's warmest location and the coolest
   point outside the city were nearly 7 degrees C and 5 degrees C,
   respectively. The city's annual average day- and nighttime temperatures

Abstract = {The rainfall anomaly (RA) associated with El Nio-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) has various unwanted impacts on agricultural system globally. The
   loss of inorganic nitrogen (N) depending on extreme wet or dry
   conditions is a major concern. The main objective of this study was to
   adapt site-specific N strategies to mitigate the effects of ENSO on
   yields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; WW) system. After thorough
   calibration and evaluation, Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology
   Transfer (DSSAT, version 4.5) model suite was adapted. Seasonal analysis
   was used to compare the variability in simulated leached-N, N uptake,
   and WW yields under long-term historical real-weather conditions. The
   site X climate interactions and impacts of weather factors on WW yields
   were assessed across 60 growing seasons in three phases of ENSO: El Nio
   (EN), La Nia (LN), and neutral (NT). Based on RA, the simulated yields
   were lower during LN than EN (11 \%) and NT (12 \%) on coastal
   sandy-loam soils and higher during LN than EN (13 \%) and NT (8 \%) on
   heavy silt loam soils at valley. N strategy with basal of 22 kg N ha(-1)
   + a split of 112 kg N ha(-1) at Feekes (F) 4 stage of WW was adapted for
   maximum yield and minimum N leaching during LN at valley and NT at
   coastal sites. However, basal of 22 kg N ha(-1) + two equal splits of 56
   kg N ha(-1) at both F4 and F6 was found as the most adaptable N strategy
   during both EN and NT phases at valley and EN and LN at coastal sites.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {8-23},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly making areas of our planet difficult or
   dangerous to inhabit. `Managed retreat', the intentional relocation of
   settlements away from hazardous zones, is growing as a proposed strategy
   for adapting to climate change in the United States and around the
   globe. As designers begin to integrate retreat into their toolkit of
   adaptation strategies, and as they are asked to participate in projects
   that include managed retreat, it is important that they also understand
   and negotiate the social, political and environmental implications of
   this form of climate adaptation. Retreat projects are often fraught with
   equity issues: who should relocate? And who should decide? Puerto Rico,
   which has a long history of displacement due to purported environmental
   risk, and which is currently the site of new retreat proposals as a
   result of Hurricane Maria's destruction, provides a space for analysing
   retreat projects and policies, and the role of spatial designers in
   their design and implementation.},

Title = {Contextualising coastal management and adaptation: Examining situated
   practices and path dependencies in Ireland and Germany},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {220},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {In the context of climate change, coastal areas around the world face
   multiple interrelated challenges. A range of `international best
   practice' approaches have been proposed to address these, including
   concepts such as inte-grated coastal zone management, ecosystem-based
   management and managed retreat. However, such supposedly mobile and
   transferable approaches often fail to properly account for the
   differences between local contexts, leading to implementation failures.
   In response, this paper mobilises the conceptual lenses of `situated
   practices' and `path dependencies' to demonstrate how the emergence and
   evolution of approaches to planning in coastal communities can generate
   policy trajectories that constrain the latitude for alternative options.
   The paper ex-plores the trajectories of coastal planning on the island
   of Sylt in Germany and Castlemaine Harbour in Ireland. It identifies
   important path dependencies associated with institutional inertia,
   collective memories of past hazards and management strategies, the
   legacies of previous coastal management measures and of coastal
   development, and the importance of property relations. Overall, the
   analysis highlights the importance of appreciating the local and
   historical distinctiveness of coastal areas and communities. It shows
   that critical attention to context and creating inclusive fora for
   debate is required to advance climate change adaptation measures that
   offer oppor-tunities to unlock historically anchored path dependencies
   which hamper flexibility and reduce resilience.},

   Climate},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Adaptation to prepare for adverse climate change impacts in the context
   of urban heat islands and outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) is receiving
   growing concern. However, knowledge of quantitative microclimatic
   conditions within the urban boundary layer in the future is still
   lacking, such that the introduction of adequate adaptation measures to
   increase OTC is challenging. To investigate the cooling performance of a
   water spraying system in a sub-tropical compact and high-rise built
   environment in summer under the influence of future (2050) climatic
   conditions, results from two validated models (Weather Research and
   Forecast (WRF) and ENVI-met models) have been used and analyzed. Our
   results indicate that the spraying system provides cooling of 2-3
   degrees C for ambient air temperature at the pedestrian-level of the
   urban canyons considered here, which benefits pedestrians. However,
   improvement of the OTC in terms of the physiological equivalent
   temperature (PET-a better indicator of human thermal sensation) was
   noticeable (e.g., <42 degrees C or from very hot to hot) when the urban
   canyon was orientated parallel to the prevailing wind direction only.
   This implies that in order to improve city resilience in terms of heat
   stress, more holistic adaptation measures in urban planning are needed.
   This includes the introduction of more breezeways and building
   disposition to facilitate the urban ventilation, as well as urban tree
   arrangement and sunshades to reduce direct solar radiation to plan for
   the impact of future climate change.},

Title = {Moving towards sustainable coastal adaptation: Analysis of hydrological
   drivers of saltwater intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {770},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Coastal lowlands are of particular importance in providing food,
   shelter, and livelihoods for large populations; yet aggravating effects
   caused by human activities and climate change have exposed these areas
   to multiple challenges. Located in the southernmost part of the Lower
   Mekong Basin, the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is adversely affected by
   upstream hydropower development, localised water-engineering systems
   (dykes), climatic factors, and sea level rise. This paper examines how
   these drivers shape the adaptation strategies of rural communities in
   the coastal areas. Using mixed sources of historical measured data,
   numerical modelling and qualitative data gathered in three coastal
   provinces (Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, and Soc Trang), we find that hydrological
   alterations are manipulated by various drivers with more immediate
   effects of the tidal systems and sea level rise in the Vietnamese East
   Sea. The study results suggest that while these impacts are not
   adequately addressed by delta-scale measures, a mixed policy approach
   including control and adaptation measures has been adopted to tackle
   saltwater intrusion on the local scale. The paper provides a holistic
   insight into the complex temporalspatial dimensions of hydrological
   change which have distressed coastal agroecosystems and
   resource-dependent communities. The paper argues that while voicing
   concerns over transboundary hydropower impacts is essential, in situ
   collaborative efforts among salinity-affected jurisdictions are equally
   important in addressing high uncertainty and complexity of saltwater
   intrusion in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Land use and land cover changes due to urbanization have led to
   significant modifications in the built environment at both local and
   regional scales, making adaptation/mitigation strategies imperative for
   the sustainable development of cities. While urban trees offer great
   potential for heat mitigation and enhanced environmental quality, most
   of the existing urban land surface models do not contain adequate
   representations of trees, particularly the radiative heat exchange in
   the canyons. In this study, we incorporated the radiative shading effect
   of urban trees into the state-of-the-art version of the coupled Weather
   Research and Forecasting-Urban Canopy Model modeling system. This
   modeling framework, albeit at its infancy, is applied to the Phoenix
   Metropolitan area to study the regional cooling effect of trees in an
   arid environment. Simulation results demonstrated the capacity of urban
   trees in reducing urban surface and air temperature by about 2 similar
   to 9 degrees C and 1 similar to 5 degrees C respectively and increasing
   relative humidity by 10 similar to 20\% during a mean diurnal cycle; the
   effect is more prominent during nighttime.},

Title = {Aiding multi-level decision-making processes for climate change
   mitigation and adaptation},

Abstract = {Progress towards climate change aware regional sustainable development
   is affected by actions at multiple spatial scales and governance levels
   and equally impacts actions at these scales. Many authors and policy
   practitioners consider therefore that decisions over policy, mitigation
   strategies and capacity for adaptation to climate change require
   construction and coordination over multiple levels of governance to
   arrive at acceptable local, regional and global management strategies.
   However, how such processes of coordination and decision-aiding can
   occur and be maintained and improved over time is a major challenge in
   need of investigation. We take on this challenge by proposing
   research-supported methods of aiding multi-level decision-making
   processes in this context. Four example regionally focussed multi-level
   case studies from diverse socio-political contexts are
   outlined-estuarine management in Australia's Lower Hawkesbury, flood and
   drought management in Bulgaria's Upper Iskar Basin, climate policy
   integration in Spain's Comunidad Valenciana and food security in
   Bangladesh's Faridpur District-from which insights are drawn. Our
   discussion focuses on exploring these insights including: (1) the
   possible advantages of informal research-supported processes and
   specifically those that provide individual arenas of participation for
   different levels of stakeholders; (2) the complexity of organisation
   processes required for aiding multi-level decision-making processes; and
   (3) to what extent progress towards integrated regional policies for
   climate change aware sustainable development can be achieved through
   research-supported processes. We finish with a speculative section that
   provides ideas and directions for future research.},

Abstract = {Mangrove species are undergoing environmental changes from nutrient-poor
   to enrichment due to the large nutrient input. The potential difference
   in adaptive strategies between the slow- and fast-growing species may
   lead to great changes in species interaction and ecosystem stability.
   This study aims to test whether the slow-growing species Aegiceras
   corniculatum (L.) Blanco and Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu \& Yong sp.
   nov. are distinctly different from a fast-growing species Laguncularia
   racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f. in response to soil nutrient enrichment. With
   the increase of soil nutrients, L. racemosa shifted from a more
   conservative to a more acquisitive strategy. The potential causes
   included the increases in specific leaf area, nutrient resorption
   efficiency, and photosynthetic capacity as indicated by the increase of
   leaf delta C-13 and unchanged leaf succulence, as well as the relocation
   of photosynthetic products as indicated by the shift toward fast-growing
   at the cost of constructive and defense compounds. In contrast, A.
   corniculatum and K. obovata maintained conservative strategies at any
   soil nutrient levels with only a slight increase in growth. These
   findings implied that L. racemosa will be more competitive over the
   slow-growing species in nutrient-rich soils through altering adaptive
   strategies.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Flooding is the most common natural hazard and third most damaging
   globally after storms and earthquakes. Anthropogenic climate change is
   expected to increase flood risk through more frequent heavy
   precipitation, increased catchment wetness and sea level rise. This
   paper reviews steps being taken by actors at international, national,
   regional and community levels to adapt to flood risk from tidal,
   fluvial, surface and groundwater sources. We refer to existing
   inventories, national and sectoral adaptation plans, flood inquiries,
   building and planning codes, city plans, research literature and
   international policy reviews. We distinguish between the enabling
   environment for adaptation and specific implementing measures to manage
   flood risk. Enabling includes routine monitoring, flood forecasting,
   data exchange, institutional reform, bridging organizations, contingency
   planning for disasters, insurance and legal incentives to reduce
   vulnerability. All such activities are `low regret' in that they yield
   benefits regardless of the climate scenario but are not cost-free.
   Implementing includes climate safety factors for new build, upgrading
   resistance and resilience of existing infrastructure, modifying
   operating rules, development control, flood forecasting, temporary and
   permanent retreat from hazardous areas, periodic review and adaptive
   management. We identify evidence of both types of adaptation following
   the catastrophic 2010/11 flooding in Victoria, Australia. However,
   significant challenges remain for managing transboundary flood risk (at
   all scales), protecting existing property at risk from flooding, and
   ensuring equitable outcomes in terms of risk reduction for all. Adaptive
   management also raises questions about the wider preparedness of society
   to systematically monitor and respond to evolving flood risks and
   vulnerabilities.},

Title = {Combining telemetry and fisheries data to quantify species overlap and

   fishery},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {702},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides are bottom-dwelling
   flatfish that support commercial and community fisheries in Baffin Bay,
   Canada. Recently, exploratory inshore summer fisheries have raised
   concerns surrounding the bycatch of Greenland sharks Somniosus
   microcephalus and Arctic skate Amblyraja hyperborea, which are
   susceptible to overfishing due to their conservative life history
   traits. To explore fisheries selectivity and opportunities for bycatch
   mitigation, we combined pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and
   fisheries data to assess habitat overlap and catch trends across these 3
   species. PSAT data showed variable inter-specific overlap, with
   Greenland sharks primarily inhabiting depths <1000 m (725 +/- 193 m),
   Greenland halibut inhabiting a narrower depth range (1030 +/- 113 m),
   and Arctic skates overlapping depths (950 +/- 225 m) of both species.
   However, fisheries data suggested high inter-specific overlap at deepest
   depths, with peak catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of all species at depths
   800-1000 m. A marked decline in Greenland shark CPUE was observed
   throughout the fishing season which was best explained by cumulative
   fishing pressure. Combined tagging and fisheries data suggest that
   targeting specific seasonal habitat will not decrease bycatch, and
   inshore summer longline fisheries should be evaluated in the context of
   potentially high elasmobranch mortality, with enforced bycatch handling
   practices and alternative mitigation measures (e.g. gear modification or
   reduced soak times) required.},

Title = {The impact of climate change scenarios on droughts and their propagation
   in an arid Mediterranean basin. A useful approach for planning
   adaptation strategies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {820},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Areas where there isa scarcity of water frequently experience
   significant drought periods, which may become exacerbated in the future
   due to climate change. In this paper we propose a novel and integrated
   method fora semi-distributed analysis of the impact on potential future
   meteorological, hydrological, agronomical and operational droughts
   within a basin. We analyse the propagation and correlation of the
   different types of droughts, and then this analysis can be used to plan
   sus-tainable adaptation strategies. The proposed method is based on
   sequential applications of different statistical techniques and
   mathematical models. We have applied several statistical downscaling
   techniques to generate consistent local future climate scenarios
   considering both basic and drought statistics. This allows us to analyse
   the sensitivity of the results to the applied technique and the spatial
   distribution. A chain of models has been used to propagate climate
   scenarios to analyse the hydrological, agricultural, and operational
   impact. We have applied a clustering analysis to historical data to
   identify homogeneous hydro-climate areas used to analyse the spatial
   distribution of the impact. The approach has been applied in the Segura
   basin (in south-eastern Spain). The simulations of the impact in the 3
   generated ensemble scenarios on the whole Segura Basin system for the
   horizon 2071-2100 under the RCP8.5 emission scenario show a significant
   mean re-duction (40.9-59.1\%) of the available resources, an increase in
   pumping rates in aquifers (36.4-42.7\%) and lower guar-antees (96.3\% in
   the historical period and 75.0-77.6\% in the future scenarios) for
   demand supply. The spatial distribution of the impact is heterogeneous,
   with the hydro-climate areas near to the coast for agricultural and
   operational droughts being more affected. An analysis of correlation
   between the meteorological and operational droughts shows the maximum
   correlation for a time delay of around 4 months. This information could
   help to identify when measures to reduce the operational impact should
   start to be applied when a meteorological drought starts.},

Title = {Urban greening to cool towns and cities: A systematic review of the
   empirical evidence},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {97},
Number = {3},
Pages = {147-155},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {`Urban greening' has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human
   health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate
   change. We used systematic review methodology to evaluate available
   evidence on whether greening interventions, such as tree planting or the
   creation of parks or green roofs, affect the air temperature of an urban
   area. Most studies investigated the air temperature within parks and
   beneath trees and are broadly supportive that green sites can be cooler
   than non-green sites. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the
   cooling effect of parks and results show that, on average, a park was
   0.94 degrees C cooler in the day. Studies on multiple parks suggest that
   larger parks and those with trees could be cooler during the day.
   However, evidence for the cooling effect of green space is mostly based
   on observational studies of small numbers of green sites. The impact of
   specific greening interventions on the wider urban area, and whether the
   effects are due to greening alone, has yet to be demonstrated. The
   current evidence base does not allow specific recommendations to be made
   on how best to incorporate greening into an urban area. Further
   empirical research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the design
   and planning of urban green space, and specifically to investigate the
   importance of the abundance, distribution and type of greening. Any
   urban greening programme implemented would need to be appropriately
   designed and monitored to continue to evaluate benefit to human health
   through reducing temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Efficient methods to mitigate SCR-induced walking of short subsea
   flowlines},
Journal = {MARINE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {76},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Steel catenary riser is a long-established option for subsea projects in
   deep-water regions. Sustained pulling force of steel catenary risers on
   subsea flowlines in combination with cyclic thermal load throughout the
   system lifetime may lead to progressive global axial displacement of
   subsea pipelines which has been termed as `walking'. One of the
   challenges in the deep-water industry is long-term walking of subsea
   flowlines in a cumulative manner. Common practice methods for walking
   mitigation are quite expensive operations. State-of-the-art mitigation
   strategies are proposed in the paper by means of modifying pipe pieces
   before the installation operation. Bowed pipe pieces and miter joints
   are two recommended approaches for walking mitigation. The presented
   mitigation strategies are relatively cost-effective solutions for the
   pipe-walking challenge and they are able to considerably cease the
   potential cyclic walking. Comprehensive FE analyses in ABAQUS software
   are performed to evaluate the proposed deformed pipelines response
   subject to two loading conditions. Through-life integrity of the
   suggested pre-deformed pipeline is assessed in terms of effective axial
   force, local buckles and excessive axial strains. A comparison of the
   presented method with conventional techniques shows the effectiveness of
   the proposed configuration. The proposed methods can significantly
   reduce effective axial force throughout the subsea pipeline by means of
   artificially introduced deformations. The cumulative walking of the
   presented method is practically zero. In addition, the influence of
   combined triggering mechanisms to the walking phenomenon is assessed
   when the pipeline is located on a sloping seabed and it is subject to
   non-uniform thermal loads. A parametric study is performed to improve
   confidence in design and provide a reasonably practical technique with
   an optimal shape.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Resilient ecosystems are vital to human well-being and are increasingly
   recognised as critical to supporting communities' efforts to adapt to
   climate change. The governing bodies of the Convention on Biological
   Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   are encouraging parties to adopt `ecosystem-based adaptation' (EbA)
   approaches, which utilise biodiversity and ecosystem services to support
   climate change adaptation. These approaches are wide ranging and include
   mangrove restoration to buffer against storm surges; watershed
   management to protect against droughts and floods; rangeland management
   to prevent desertification; and sustainable management of fisheries and
   forests to ensure food security. This article examines the emergence of
   EbA in international legal frameworks for climate change and
   biodiversity and progress towards implementation. The EbA concept is
   potentially powerful in catalysing international and national
   commitments to act due to its key defining features of a focus on
   societal adaptation rather than ecocentricism, and a targeting of the
   immediate adaptation needs of the poorest and most vulnerable
   communities who are adversely affected by climate change. However,
   examination of national policy and practice in two least developed
   countries, Samoa and Cambodia, reveals that institutional and legal
   barriers at national level can pose significant challenges to
   operationalising EbA to achieve adaptation objectives.},

Title = {A typology of responsibility for coastal flood risk adaptation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {The management of coastal flood risk is adapting to meet the challenges
   and increased risks posed by population change as well as by climate
   change, especially sea level rise. Protection is being targeted to areas
   where the benefits are highest, while elsewhere there is a shift towards
   more localized ``living with floods{''} and ``resilience{''} approaches.
   Such decentralized approaches to flood risk management (FRM) require a
   diverse range of stakeholder groups to be engaged as ``flood risk
   citizens{''}. Engagement of households in FRM is central to this
   process. Despite significant research on stakeholder engagement in
   coastal and flood risk management, there is less focus on the nature of
   responsibility in coastal adaptation. There is no framework by which to
   assess the different types of responsibility in hazard management and
   adaptation, and little research on the implications of expecting these
   responsibilities of stakeholder groups. In this paper, we identify five
   types of responsibility that are embedded throughout the disaster risk
   reduction cycle of managing coastal flooding. We build this ``typology
   of responsibility{''} on existing work on the evolution of stakeholder
   engagement and stakeholder responsibility relationships in risk
   management processes, and a dataset of institutional stakeholder
   interviews and households surveys conducted across three case studies in
   England, the United Kingdom, in 2018 and 2019. We analyze the interviews
   using thematic analysis to explore institutional stakeholder perceptions
   of responsibility in coastal FRM, and analyze the household survey
   through descriptive and inferential statistics. By developing the first
   disaster risk reduction focused typology of responsibility for coastal
   flooding, we provide researchers and decision-makers with a tool to
   guide their planning and allocation of responsibilities in risk
   management for floods and other climate-driven hazards.},

Title = {Identifying and mitigating risks to completion of small grant climate
   change adaptation projects: evidence from the Pacific},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over recent decades, substantial funding from a variety of sources has
   been directed towards climate change adaptation projects in Pacific
   Island countries. There remains, however, considerable uncertainty about
   which factors influence adaptation project completion, as a pre-cursor
   to effective adaptation. In this study, we empirically establish the
   links between project attributes (duration, funding, cash co-financing,
   in-kind contributions, location, and adaptation approach) and whether a
   project is likely to complete or be terminated. We examine this issue by
   developing a logistic regression model to predict the probability of
   completion for small-scale climate change adaptation projects using a
   new dataset of 190 projects in the South Pacific (with end dates ranging
   from November 1995 to May 2016) that were financed through the Global
   Environment Facility Small Grants Programme. Empirical results suggest
   that all else equal, such a project was more likely to complete if it
   was shorter, received more co-financing cash input and in-kind support
   from other donors and project partners, was explicitly targeted towards
   climate change adaptation, focused on a single adaptation approach, and
   was undertaken in Micronesia or Fiji. Our results can be used to help
   funders and project proponents design projects to mitigate the risks of
   non-completion, particularly in high-risk settings. These findings
   should not be misinterpreted to undermine the importance of continued
   investment in adaptation projects across the whole of South Pacific
   region.},

Title = {Coping with sudden mine closure: The importance of resilient communities
   and good governance},
Journal = {EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Three-quarters of mines close suddenly. Despite the work to improve
   planning for mine closure, it is planning for unexpected closure that is
   particularly important. This paper reviews three case studies: Singkep
   Island, Indonesia (tin mining 1812- 1992), Blyvooruitzicht, South Africa
   (gold mining 1942 - 2013), and Sussex, Canada (potash mining 1983-2016)
   to analyse the impacts of mining before and after sudden mine closure.
   The first two studies represent unsustainable development in which the
   benefits of mining were lost soon after closure. The third case study
   concerns a mining region that maintained sustainable development despite
   the sudden mine closure. This study suggests that the following
   encourage sustainable development: ensuring early shared-use of mining
   infrastructure, using mining facilities to improve local workforce
   skills, ongoing community engagement, and implementation of progressive
   closure and preparation of a contingency plan. These mitigation
   strategies generate resilient communities in mining regions. They
   require regional governments and communities taking more significant
   initiatives. This research demonstrates that responsible mining schemes
   tend to focus on just the mining companies and particularly on
   environmental aspects of closure. This is a good start, but there is a
   need for collaboration and cooperation between companies and (regional)
   governments to deliver the best outcomes.},

Journal = {RISK HAZARDS \& CRISIS IN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-222},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {There are several important linkages among environmental hazards and
   crises caused (at least in part) by human-caused global warming, and
   both homeland security and national security risk analysis and practice.
   Increasingly robust research has demonstrated (1) anthropogenic climate
   change and its interaction with other human environmental pressures
   (population, pollution, and resource consumption growth); (2) worsening
   climate disruption patterns and disaster projections, showing long-range
   risk to the very survival of human civilization; and ( 3) links among
   environmental hazards, human economic and political instability, and
   development of political violence. This paper discusses how and why
   environmental security (ES) and homeland security (HS) are linked,
   including the threat-multiplying aspect of climate disruption risk
   factors; briefly contextualizes their growing interconnectedness in both
   theory and policy practice; and reviews some of what is most recently
   known about the science of climate disruption. It reviews disaster
   mitigation and resilient adaptation policy implications of climate
   variables such as extreme heat and drought, extreme storms, sea level
   rise, ocean ecosystem damage, and food and water crises. Most U.S.
   government security-related organizations now incorporate HS-ES mission
   statements, but current environmental security risk management and
   planning investment is insufficient, and burdened by political
   obstruction and costly scientific uncertainties.},

Title = {``We're people of the snow:{''} Weather, climate change, and Inuit

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {262},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rapid environmental change due to climate change impacts Inuit mental
   wellness by altering the relationships between people, place,
   livelihoods, and culture. Little is known, however, about how
   fluctuations in weather contribute to the experience of place and the
   connection to mental wellness in Inuit communities. This study aimed to
   characterize the importance of changes in weather among Inuit, and how
   these changes influence mental health and wellness in the context of
   climate change. Data were drawn from a community-driven and Inuit-led
   study in the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada. In-depth interviews
   (n = 116 people) were conducted between November 2012 to May 2013 in the
   five Nunatsiavut communities. Qualitative data were thematically
   analyzed using a constant comparative method. Results indicated that
   weather impacted mental wellness through three key pathways: 1) shaping
   daily lived experiences including connection to place and other
   determinants of wellbeing; 2) altering mood and emotion on a transient
   basis; and 3) seasonally influencing individual and community health and
   wellbeing. These results demonstrate the immediate role weather has in
   shaping mental wellness in Nunatsiavut. In turn, this understanding of
   the climate-mental wellness relationship points to multiple pathways for
   action on climate adaptation policy and programming, and underscores the
   need for more culturally-specific and place-based investigations to
   appropriately respond to the mental health impacts of climate change.},

Title = {Waterlogging, crop damage and adaptation interventions in the coastal
   region of Bangladesh: A perception analysis of local people},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Waterlogging is a persistent problem resulting in damage to crops and
   therefore livelihood of the coastal people in the southwestern region of
   Bangladesh. It is important to better understand the perception of local
   people on this problem to formulate appropriate policy interventions.
   This research aimed at analyzing the perception of local people on
   waterlogging, its impact on crop production and related adaptation
   interventions in Khulna district. Concurrent mixed methods of research
   were employed and a total of 200 households were interviewed. The
   findings revealed that lack of silt removal or dredging in canals,
   reduction of water flow in canals and encroachment of canals were the
   main causes of waterlogging. Major demographic, social and economic
   characteristics of the surveyed households rarely affected crop
   production. It was also observed that delayed cropping reduced
   waterlogging-induced crop damage in coastal areas. Although local people
   spontaneously participated in traditional adaptation methods, they
   hardly realized their own contributions towards the practices. About
   one-third of the local people were not aware of institutional
   initiatives addressing waterlogging. They proposed structural solutions
   such as re-excavation of canals to reduce waterlogging. Furthermore,
   majority of the people living inside the polder (a low-lying tract of
   land enclosed by a built construction that forms an artificial
   hydrological unit) perceived that institutions and management were
   vitally important. The post-facto nature of adaptation interventions in
   the region might lead to unusual losses and damages, which could be
   minimized through a good mix of technology and management.},

Title = {Tropical cyclone perceptions, impacts and adaptation in the Southwest
   Pacific: an urban perspective from Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The destruction caused by tropical cyclone (TC) Pam in March 2015 is
   considered one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Vanuatu.
   It has highlighted the need for a better understanding of TC impacts and
   adaptation in the Southwest Pacific (SWP) region. Therefore, the key
   aims of this study are to (i) understand local perceptions of TC
   activity, (ii) investigate impacts of TC activity and (iii) uncover
   adaptation strategies used to offset the impacts of TCs. To address
   these aims, a survey (with 130 participants from urban areas) was
   conducted across three SWP small island states (SISs): Fiji, Vanuatu and
   Tonga (FVT). It was found that respondents generally had a high level of
   risk perception and awareness of TCs and the associated physical
   impacts, but lacked an understanding of the underlying weather
   conditions. Responses highlighted that current methods of adaptation
   generally occur at the local level, immediately prior to a TC event
   (preparation of property, gathering of food, finding a safe place to
   shelter). However higher level adaptation measures (such as the
   modification to building structures) may reduce vulnerability further.
   Finally, we discuss the potential of utilising weather-related
   traditional knowledge and non-traditional knowledge of empirical and
   climate-model-based weather forecasts to improve TC outlooks, which
   would ultimately reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity.
   Importantly, lessons learned from this study may result in the
   modification and/ or development of existing adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {The likely impacts of climate change at the coast are potentially
   devastating to both the built and natural environments. Mounting
   evidence suggests that natural hazard events such as landsliding,
   erosion and flooding may occur more frequently and as increasingly
   intense episodes, due to the effects of climate change. It is necessary
   to identify and prepare for the likely impacts of climate change at the
   coast, and to implement risk management strategies, in order to reduce
   the escalating risks and growing financial burden on coastal
   communities. To assist in the achievement of this aim, ``RESPONSE{''}
   was a 3-year project (2003-2006) led by the Isle of Wight Council's
   Centre for the Coastal Environment, UK, with nine partners in the UK,
   France, Italy and Poland. The Project received financial support from
   the EU LIFE-Environment Programme. The Project developed advice and
   guidance for practitioners and decision-makers to assess and reduce the
   likely impacts of climate change along a defined stretch of coastline,
   to understand and communicate the likely pattern of future change
   including areas of high risk. This can contribute to the development of
   sustainable and practical management strategies to mitigate the impacts
   of climate change and assist prioritisation of resources.},

Abstract = {Climate change affects rainfall and temperature producing a breakdown in
   the water balance and a variation in the dynamic of freshwater-seawater
   in coastal areas, exacerbating seawater intrusion (SWI) problems. The
   target of this paper is to propose a method to assess and analyze
   impacts of future global change (GC) scenarios on SWI at the aquifer
   scale in a coastal area. Some adaptation measures have been integrated
   in the definition of future GC scenarios incorporating complementary
   resources within the system in accordance with urban development
   planning. The proposed methodology summarizes the impacts of potential
   GC scenarios in terms of SWI status and vulnerability at the aquifer
   scale through steady pictures (maps and conceptual 2D cross sections for
   specific dates or statistics of a period) and time series for lumped
   indices. It is applied to the Plana de Oropesa-Torreblanca aquifer. The
   results summarize the influence of GC scenarios in the global status and
   vulnerability to SWI under some management scenarios. These GC scenarios
   would produce higher variability of SWI status and vulnerability.},

Title = {Adaptation to uncertain sea-level rise; how uncertainty in Antarctic
   mass-loss impacts the coastal adaptation strategy of the Netherlands},

Abstract = {Uncertainties in the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise (SLR)
   complicate decision making on coastal adaptation. Large uncertainty
   arises from potential ice mass-loss from Antarctica that could rapidly
   increase SLR in the second half of this century. The implications of SLR
   may be existential for a low-lying country like the Netherlands and
   warrant exploration of high-impact low-likelihood scenarios. To deal
   with uncertain SLR, the Netherlands has adopted an adaptive pathways
   plan. This paper analyzes the implications of storylines leading to
   extreme SLR for the current adaptive plan in the Netherlands, focusing
   on flood risk, fresh water resources, and coastline management. It
   further discusses implications for coastal adaptation in low-lying
   coastal zones considering timescales of adaptation including the
   decisions lifetime and lead-in time for preparation and implementation.
   We find that as sea levels rise faster and higher, sand nourishment
   volumes to maintain the Dutch coast may need to be up to 20 times larger
   than to date in 2100, storm surge barriers will need to close at
   increasing frequency until closed permanently, and intensified saltwater
   intrusion will reduce freshwater availability while the demand is
   rising. The expected lifetime of investments will reduce drastically.
   Consequently, step-wise adaptation needs to occur at an increasing
   frequency or with larger increments while there is still large SLR
   uncertainty with the risk of under- or overinvesting. Anticipating
   deeply uncertain, high SLR scenarios helps to enable timely adaptation
   and to appreciate the value of emission reduction and monitoring of the
   Antarctica contribution to SLR.},

Abstract = {Large diameter monopiles are widely used for the installation of
   offshore wind turbines in relatively shallow water depth applications.
   Monopiles are considered as a cost and time-efficient foundation
   solution, taking advantage of the experience gained from the Oil\&Gas
   industry. Due to their relatively large diameter, monopiles are
   susceptible to scour effects that threaten their structural integrity
   and necessitate the application of high-cost mitigation measures. The
   mitigation measures are also associated with heavy environmental impact
   at the local subsea environment, as well as increased CO2 emissions for
   their application.
   The present work examines the effect of scour on the structural
   integrity of monopiles using integrated simulation models that combine
   advanced finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) techniques. A typical monopile geometry and North Sea
   representative metocean data are used in a case study. In this example
   analysis emphasis is given on the structural integrity deterioration
   resulting from the scour development over time. Advanced techniques are
   employed to simulate the soil-pile interaction. Furthermore,
   fluid-structure interaction effects due to the water flow around the
   monopile are examined using CFD techniques. Finally, fatigue life
   predictions of sensitive areas are conducted based on the ``S-N
   methodology{''} and are enhanced by employing crackgrowth analyses based
   on linear elastic fracture mechanics principles.},

   not protect coral reefs from climate change, yet most local
   threat-reduction strategies have not been tested experimentally. We show
   that removing coral predators is a common local action used by managers

   Coralliophila abbreviata from Caribbean brain corals (Pseudodiploria and
   Diploria species) before a major warming event increased coral
   resilience by reducing bleaching severity (resistance) and
   post-bleaching tissue mortality (recovery). Our results highlight the
   need for increased evaluation and identification of local interventions

Title = {Contrasting Futures for Australia's Fisheries Stocks Under IPCC RCP8.5
   Emissions - A Multi-Ecosystem Model Approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Climate-driven trends in ocean temperature and primary productivity are
   projected to differ greatly across the globe, triggering variable levels
   of concern for marine biota and ecosystems. Quantifying these changes,
   and the complex ways in which resource-dependent communities will need
   to respond, is inherently difficult. Existing uncertainty about the
   structure, function and responses of marine ecosystems, means that a
   multi-model or ensemble model approach is the most prudent means of
   assessing the potential ecosystem responses to climate change. In this
   study, climate-ecological projections of 13 marine ecosystem models for
   regions around Australia were evaluated. Model types included dynamic
   food web, spatial whole of ecosystem, intermediate complexity, species
   distribution, and size spectrum models and were all forced by
   high-resolution ocean model data. Each Australian region and fishery
   will face its own challenges in terms of ecosystem shifts and fisheries
   management responses over the next 30 years. Across regions, demersal
   systems appear to be more strongly affected by climate change than
   pelagic systems, with invertebrate species in shallow waters likely to
   respond first and to a larger degree. With the assistance of qualitative
   confidence evaluations, the multi-model approach was useful for
   identifying the likely state of concern for each functional group and
   thus adaptive management and research priorities. Largest model
   discrepancies were found between the regional ecosystem models that
   represent trophic interactions and the species distribution models, with
   implications for future assessments and adaption planning. Study results
   highlight that fisheries and their management will need to foster
   pro-active and flexible adaptation options to make the most of coming
   opportunities and to minimize risks or negative outcomes.},

Abstract = {Alterations on the land surfaces, which are attributed by human
   activities, especially in cities, cause many implications to the
   ecosystem. The increase of buildings in cities is reflecting the growth
   of human activities resulted in a significant temperature increase and
   warmer pattern in the urban area than the surrounding countryside. The
   phenomenon defined as urban heat island. This study investigates the
   application and efficiency of the green roof as an approach to mitigate
   urban heat island and reducing indoor temperature in a building. Two
   types of roof models, which consist of vegetative roof and
   non-vegetative roof, were built to investigate the efficiency of
   vegetated roof in reducing indoor temperature compared to the
   non-vegetated roof. The outdoor and indoor temperature and humidity of
   each roof model were monitored by using RH520 Thermo Hygrometer. The
   data was collected for three times in a week for 9 weeks at 9:00am to
   5:00pm. It was found that the indoor average temperature data for
   vegetative roof could be reduced 2.4 degrees C from the outdoor average
   temperature and 0.8 C for non-vegetative roof The difference of
   temperature reduction for vegetative roof was greater than the non
   vegetative roof, thus indicate that green roof was highly efficient in
   reducing indoor temperature and mitigate urban heat island impact.},

Abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) has emerged worldwide as a tool for
   sustainable ocean governance. This paper reviews how sustainability and
   ecosystem-based management (EBM) have been included so far within the
   MSP general framework, by carrying out: (I) a review on the links
   between sustainability, EBM and MSP in EU maritime policy initiatives;
   (2) an analysis on the differences between ecosystem-based MSP versus
   MSP focused on delivering blue growth; and (3) a discussion on how
   adaptive management may address some of the main challenges found in
   achieving sustainable ocean management. From the EU Green Paper (2006)
   to the MSP Directive Proposal (2013), MSP processes based on the
   principle of EBM have been recognized as a necessary tool to ensure
   maritime sustainable development. Although ecosystem-based MSP has been
   recently presented as the best way to ensure both ecosystem conservation
   and development of human activities, most national and European MSP
   initiatives seem to follow a MSP approach focused in delivering blue
   growth. A challenge, therefore, arises: how to adjust policy decisions
   to properly preserve ecosystems and the services they provide? If truly
   implemented, an adaptive approach seems to be a way forward in ensuring
   that spatial planning, management and policy-making in marine spaces can
   be continuously adjusted, thus allowing for sustainability. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Realistic predictions of climate change effects on natural resources are
   central to adaptation policies that try to reduce these impacts.
   However, most current forecasting approaches do not incorporate
   species-specific, process-based biological information, which limits
   their ability to inform actionable strategies. Mechanistic approaches,
   incorporating quantitative information on functional traits, can
   potentially predict species- and population-specific responses that
   result from the cumulative impacts of small-scale processes acting at
   the organismal level, and can be used to infer population-level dynamics
   and inform natural resources management. Here we present a
   proof-of-concept study using the European anchovy as a model species
   that shows how a trait-based, mechanistic species distribution model can
   be used to explore the vulnerability of marine species to environmental
   changes, producing quantitative outputs useful for informing fisheries
   management. We crossed scenarios of temperature and food to generate
   quantitative maps of selected mechanistic model outcomes (e.g., Maximum
   Length and Total Reproductive Output). These results highlight changing
   patterns of source and sink spawning areas as well as the incidence of
   reproductive failure. This study demonstrates that model predictions
   based on functional traits can reduce the degree of uncertainty when
   forecasting future trends of fish stocks. However, to be effective they
   must be based on high spatial- and temporal resolution environmental
   data. Such a sensitive and spatially explicit predictive approach may be
   used to inform more effective adaptive management strategies of
   resources in novel climatic conditions.},

Title = {Managing Shoreline Change Under Increasing Sea- Level Rise in Ghana},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {555-567},
Abstract = {Relative sea-level rise will affect vulnerable coastal communities
   globally. Quantifying this effect on the coastal environment and
   infrastructure provides critical information that enables coastal
   managers to develop sustainable mitigation and adaptation measures.
   Modeling applications have enabled the past, present, and future trends
   in shoreline morphology to be investigated in detail. Predictive
   numerical models depend largely on the reliability of the input data.
   This article reports on using the Soft Cliff and Platform Erosion
   (SCAPE) numerical model to simulate future shoreline evolution trend in
   the central Accra coast in Ghana. The model input parameters include
   historic shoreline recession rates, wave data, tidal data, bathymetry,
   beach volume, beach topography, historic relative sea-level rise rates,
   and the shoreline orientation. The data fed the SCAPE numerical model
   which simulated the emergence of soft rock shore profiles over timescale
   of decades to centuries, to project future positions of the central
   Accra shoreline for the next 100years under different scenarios of
   climate change. Simulated future shoreline positions overlaid on a 2005
   orthophoto map of Accra enabled vulnerable areas and infrastructure at
   risk to be identified. It emerged that a highly populated community in
   central Accra will be inundated by 2065, while the Rivera beach resort
   will be eroded from 2035. A natural fish landing site in Osu (suburb in
   Accra) will be lost from 2045. The study has demonstrated that
   considerable ecological, economic, social, and national losses should be
   expected within the next century. Shoreline change management options
   should be explored to help mitigate the expected impact of the sea-level
   rise.},

   Literature Review and Framework},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The scale and scope of climate change has triggered widespread
   acknowledgement of the need to adapt to it. Out of recent work
   attempting to understand, define, and contribute to the family of
   concepts related to adaptation efforts, considerable contributions and
   research have emerged. Yet, the field of climate adaptation constantly
   grapples with complex ideas whose relational interplay is not always
   clear. Similarly, understanding how applied climate change adaptation
   efforts unfold through planning processes that are embedded in broader
   institutional settings can be difficult to apprehend. We present a
   review of important theory, themes, and terms evident in the literature
   of spatial planning and climate change adaptation to integrate them and
   synthesize a conceptual framework illustrating their dynamic interplay.
   This leads to consideration of how institutions, urban governance, and
   the practice of planning are involved, and evolving, in shaping climate
   adaptation efforts. While examining the practice of adaptation planning
   is useful in framing how core climate change concepts are related, the
   role of institutional processes in shaping and defining these
   concepts-and adaptation planning itself-remains complex. Our framework
   presents a useful tool for approaching and improving an understanding of
   the interactive relationships of central climate change adaptation
   concepts, with implications for future work focused on change within the
   domains of planning and institutions addressing challenges in the
   climate change era.},

Volume = {48},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change are of particular concern to the coastal
   region of tropical countries like India, which are exposed to cyclones,
   floods, tsunami, seawater intrusion, etc. Climate-change adaptation
   presupposes comprehensive assessment of vulnerability status. Studies so
   far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical
   vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope
   for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop
   a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal
   India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative
   vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and
   adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and
   credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village
   level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity
   (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23
   indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were
   identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion
   survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The
   socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function
   of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level
   interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in
   Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317
   villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla.
   The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria
   approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30\%) in Sindhudurg were
   identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for
   identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their
   level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix,
   thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here,
   vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as drivers'
   (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority)
   and buffers' (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village
   level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI
   and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and
   enable swift action for climate adaptation.},

Abstract = {Registering a 7.3 magnitude on the Richter scale, the 921 Chi-Chi
   Earthquake that struck central Taiwan on September 21, 1999 left the
   island nation with fragile soils, frequent floods, and debris flow,
   further weakening homeland resources. Taiwan's dense population had
   forced its residents to use mountain hills for agriculture and
   development. The 92-Flood in 2004, which incurred vast monetary losses
   and human casualties, caused the government to rethink its strategy for
   land use. In order to use land in a more efficient and in an
   eco-friendly manner, the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
   Executive Yuan of the Taiwanese government proposed the ``Land Recovery
   Strategy and Action Plan{''} in 2006. Its core concept was aimed at
   ``respecting, and adapting to, nature.{''} To achieve this goal, a
   hillside watershed management and flood mitigation policy was proposed.
   Factors of safety, economy, and ecology were included in the policy.
   Both strategies and practical measures to be implemented were organized
   in a chart for better understanding and for reference by other countries
   with similar conditions.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3363-3381},

Abstract = {Megacities are predominantly concentrated along coastlines, making them
   exposed to a diverse mix of natural hazards. The assessment of climatic
   hazard risk to cities rarely has captured the multiple interactions that
   occur in complex urban systems. We present an improved method for urban
   multi-hazard risk assessment. We then analyze the risk of New York City
   as a case study to apply enhanced methods for multi-hazard risk
   assessment given the history of exposure to multiple types of natural
   hazards which overlap spatially and, in some cases, temporally in this
   coastal megacity. Our aim is to identify hotspots of multi-hazard risk
   to support the prioritization of adaptation strategies that can address
   multiple sources of risk to urban residents. We used socioeconomic
   indicators to assess vulnerabilities and risks to three climate-related
   hazards (i.e., heat waves, inland flooding and coastal flooding) at high
   spatial resolution. The analysis incorporates local experts' opinions to
   identify sources of multi-hazard risk and to weight indicators used in
   the multi-hazard risk assessment. Results demonstrate the application of
   multi-hazard risk assessment to a coastal megacity and show that spatial
   hotspots of multi-hazard risk affect similar local residential
   communities along the coastlines. Analyses suggest that New York City
   should prioritize adaptation in coastal zones and consider possible
   synergies and/or trade-offs to maximize impacts of adaptation and
   resilience interventions in the spatially overlapping areas at risk of
   impacts from multiple hazards.},

Title = {Public perceptions of managed realignment strategies: The case study of
   the Ebro Delta in the Mediterranean basin},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {38-47},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Managed realignment strategies, based on working with physical processes
   and dynamic environments, are gaining weight in sustainable coastal
   erosion management. However, this kind of innovative adaptive strategy
   can give rise to major social conflicts. A proposal to implement managed
   realignment in the Ebro Delta in Spain is provoking intense social
   conflict between different socioeconomic sectors. This qualitative
   study, based on semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders,
   analyses social perceptions of three management strategies aimed at
   coping with coastal erosion in the Ebro Delta in order to throw some
   light on the main barriers to a managed realignment strategy. The
   results reveal the complexities of the local conflict and highlights
   issues such as mistrust of public authorities and limited understanding
   of managed realignment. A lengthy hold-the-line tradition in coastal
   policies in Spain and local idiosyncrasies contextualize a problem that
   was initially perceived as one of the typical conflict of interest
   between conservationists and the primary economic sector. Efforts to
   provide transparent information, improve participation and build trust
   are suggested in order to be able to implement managed realignment
   strategies with the cooperation of the local community. (C) 2012

Title = {Indigenous flood control and management knowledge and flood disaster
   risk reduction in Nigeria's coastal communities: An empirical analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Flooding is one of the major global challenges today. The role of
   indigenous knowledge in offering an effective risk reduction strategy
   towards flood disaster disregarded for many decades is now gaining
   global recognition. There is a growing call for empirical identification
   of the effectiveness of indigenous knowledge in flood risk reduction.
   Consequently, this paper empirically examines indigenous flood control
   and management knowledge with the intent to identify its effectiveness
   in risk reduction of flood disasters in Nigeria's coastal communities.
   This is to provide empirical bases for the formulation of appropriate
   strategies for enhancing flood risk reduction in Nigeria's coastal
   communities. The research engaged focus group discussion and
   questionnaire methods to generate primary data. The research proceeds
   with principal component analysis to classify and measure the
   effectiveness of indigenous flood control and management knowledge in
   flood risk reduction. The result shows the existence of eight types of
   indigenous flood control and management knowledge in the coastal
   communities and they were 61.2\% effective in flood risk reduction. This
   implies that indigenous flood control and management knowledge practiced
   in Nigeria's coastal communities is effective in flood risk reduction.
   This study proposed a sustainable approach to risk reduction in flood
   disasters based on the integration of indigenous knowledge systems and
   modern flood management strategies.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cultural sites are particularly important to Indigenous peoples, their
   identity, cosmology and sociopolitical traditions. The benefits of local
   control, and a lack of professional resources, necessitate the
   development of planning tools that support independent Indigenous
   cultural site adaptation. We devised and tested a methodology for
   non-heritage professionals to analyse options that address site loss,
   build site resilience and build local adaptive capacity. Indigenous
   rangers from Kakadu National Park and the Djelk Indigenous Protected
   Area, Arnhem Land, Australia, were engaged as fellow researchers via a
   participatory action research methodology. Rangers rejected coastal
   defences and relocating sites, instead prioritising routine use of a
   risk field survey, documentation of vulnerable sites using new digital
   technologies and widely communicating the climate change vulnerability
   of sites via a video documentary. Results support the view that rigorous
   approaches to cultural site adaptation can be employed independently by
   local Indigenous stakeholders.},

   case for the Coastal Embankment Improvement Project in Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study presents empirical evidence of the nexus between social
   cohesion and climate change adaptation from a tropical cyclone prone
   coastal district of Bangladesh. The climate change adaptation measure
   considered here is the reduction of tropical cyclone risk through the
   improvement of coastal polders. The study exploits a unique policy
   context and uses household data obtained through a contingent valuation
   survey asking whether 400 randomly sampled male and female inhabitants
   would pay a one-off surcharge to co-finance the Coastal Embankment
   Improvement Project (CEIP)-the centrepiece of the Bangladesh
   Government's climate change adaptation policy in the coastal zone. A
   social cohesion index is constructed by summing subjective indicators of
   trust, mutual co-operation and confidence in collective action.
   Controlling for a large number of individual, household and community
   characteristics and village fixed effects, the regression results reveal
   a significant positive relationship between the social cohesion index
   and willingness to pay for polder improvement. The study finds a
   significant welfare benefit of and widespread public support for the
   CEIP. The mean one-off will-ingness to pay to support the CEIP varies
   from US\$35 to US\$65.},

Abstract = {Suspended sediment concentration is an important estuarine health
   indicator. Estuarine ecosystems rely on the maintenance of habitat
   conditions, which are changing due to direct human impact and climate
   change. This study aims to evaluate the impact of climate change
   relative to engineering measures on estuarine fine sediment dynamics and
   sediment budgets. We use the highly engineered San Francisco Bay-Delta
   system as a case study. We apply a process-based modeling approach
   (Delft3D-FM) to assess the changes in hydrodynamics and sediment
   dynamics resulting from climate change and engineering scenarios. The
   scenarios consider a direct human impact (shift in water pumping
   location), climate change (sea level rise and suspended sediment
   concentration decrease), and abrupt disasters (island flooding, possibly
   as the results of an earthquake). Levee failure has the largest impact
   on the hydrodynamics of the system. Reduction in sediment input from the
   watershed has the greatest impact on turbidity levels, which are key to
   primary production and define habitat conditions for endemic species.
   Sea level rise leads to more sediment suspension and a net sediment
   export if little room for accommodation is left in the system due to
   continuous engineering works. Mitigation measures like levee
   reinforcement are effective for addressing direct human impacts, but
   less effective for a persistent, widespread, and increasing threat like
   sea level rise. Progressive adaptive mitigation measures to the changes
   in sediment and flow dynamics resulting from sea level rise may be a
   more effective strategy. Our approach shows that a validated
   process-based model is a useful tool to address long-term (decades to
   centuries) changes in sediment dynamics in highly engineered estuarine
   systems. In addition, our modeling approach provides a useful basis for
   long-term, process-based studies addressing ecosystem dynamics and
   health.},

Title = {Landlessness as the key challenge to climate change adaptation of the
   rural poor in Bangladesh: an empirical study},
Journal = {ASIAN GEOGRAPHER},
Abstract = {Bangladesh is ranked top among the locations most affected locations by
   extreme weather events over the last two decades and one of the
   potential victims of the consequences of climate change. Around 3.26
   million rural Bangladeshi households are landless. These landless
   households usually constitute the poorest and most vulnerable groups in
   Bangladesh and are the first victims of climatic hazards. Despite the
   adaptation measures taken by the government and non-governmental
   organizations, landlessness generates constraints to adapt to the
   changing environment. Taking the above premises, this paper principally
   aims to unveil how landlessness poses challenges for the rural poor of
   Bangladesh in their endeavor to adapt to already emerging conditions of
   climate change. Based on qualitative interviews of relevant
   stakeholders, this paper finds that landlessness is a key challenge to
   the climate change adaptation process as it hinders livelihoods and
   income-generating activities of the people living in rural and coastal
   regions. Moreover, this study finds that landless people living near
   urban spaces are better placed to migrate to the cities for livelihoods
   and shelter. This study also adds insightful evidence suggesting that
   lack of access to land or land entitlement is a major setback to the
   existing climate change adaptation policy in Bangladesh.},

Title = {Manipulating, managing and rehabilitating mangrove-dominated wetlands
   along Florida's east coast (USA): balancing mosquito control and
   ecological values},
Journal = {WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Florida, mangrove-dominated wetlands have been manipulated and
   managed largely for control of mosquitoes or to make way for human
   development since the late 1800s. More recently, many wetlands have been
   rehabilitated as their contributions to estuarine ecosystems became
   apparent and techniques that restored valuable contributions without
   compromising control of mosquitoes became available. This paper
   documents the history of manipulations largely used to control mosquito
   production in wetlands on the east coast of Florida, which have included
   ditching, filling, and impounding. It describes the management of these
   environmentally sensitive habitats since World War II and approximately
   40 years of effort to rehabilitate these systems and improve their
   management. Improvements have been accomplished via adaptive management,
   science-based decision making and engagement of diverse groups of
   resource managers and stakeholders. Interagency efforts to provide
   balanced management of these wetlands are discussed, and work is
   presented to demonstrate the outcomes from rehabilitating impoundments
   in the Indian River Lagoon. These strategies for management and
   rehabilitation should provide guidance for restoring and conserving
   critical ecosystem services delivered by mangrove-dominated wetlands
   elsewhere, including survival in the face of future environmental
   changes.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation destroy coral
   reefs, the ecosystem services they provide, and the livelihoods of close
   to a billion people who depend on these services. Restoration approaches
   to increase the resilience of corals are therefore necessary to counter
   environmental pressures relevant to climate change projections. In this
   Review, we examine the natural processes that can increase the adaptive
   capacity of coral holobionts, with the aim of preserving ecosystem
   functioning under future ocean conditions. Current approaches that
   centre around restoring reef cover can be integrated with emerging
   approaches to enhance coral stress resilience and, thereby, allow reefs
   to regrow under a new set of environmental conditions. Emerging
   approaches such as standardized acute thermal stress assays, selective
   sexual propagation, coral probiotics, and environmental hardening could
   be feasible and scalable in the real world. However, they must follow
   decision-making criteria that consider the different reef,
   environmental, and ecological conditions. The implementation of adaptive
   interventions tailored around nature-based solutions will require
   standardized frameworks, appropriate ecological risk-benefit
   assessments, and analytical routines for consistent and effective
   utilization and global coordination.
   Anthropogenic climate change and environmental deterioration are driving
   global degradation of coral reefs. This Review examines how the natural
   adaptive capacity of coral holobionts can be harnessed and expanded to
   counter the ongoing loss of coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Adaptation planning for flood risk forms a significant part of global
   climate change response. Engineering responses to higher water levels
   can be prohibitively costly. Several recent studies emphasize the
   potential role of ecosystems in flood protection as adaptive risk
   reduction measures while also contributing to carbon fixation. Here, we
   use a conceptual model study to illustrate the built-in adaptive
   capability of ecosystems to reduce a wide range of wave heights,
   occurring at different water levels, to a narrower range. Our model
   shows that wave height of waves running through a forested section is
   independent of initial height or of water level. Although the underlying
   phenomenon of non-linear wave attenuation within coastal vegetation is
   well studied, implications of reducing variability in wave heights for
   design of ecosystem and levee combinations have not yet been properly
   outlined. Narrowing the range of wave heights by a vegetation field
   generates an adaptive levee that is robust to a whole range of external
   conditions rather than only to a maximum wave height. This feature can
   substantially reduce costs for retrofitting of levees under changing
   future wave climates. Thereby, in wave prone areas, inclusion of
   ecosystems into flood defense schemes constitutes an adaptive and safe
   alternative to only hard engineered flood risk measures.},

   LiDAR-derived digital elevation models},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {232},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One of the main consequences of climate change is the sea level rise
   (SLR), which impacts coastal areas affecting many infrastructures,
   particularly seaports, whose operations may be jeopardized. In this
   paper, a methodological framework is developed to assess the impact of
   SLR on port operability by using digital elevation models derived from
   LiDAR data. The methodology is applied to four ports along the Catalan
   Coast (NW Mediterranean). The study is made for the RCP8.5 scenario from
   IPCC, analysing port operability every 10 years throughout the 21st
   century. The approach provided here allows a port authority to determine
   which berthing areas will be affected at each port and at each time
   interval. Results show that, if no adaptation measures are taken, ports
   will have significant reductions of present operability for most of
   their activities, in particular after year 2070. This work shows that
   the developed methodological framework is a very useful tool for port
   authorities to detect operability tipping points and to design well in
   advance the necessary adaptation pathways to overcome the expected
   impacts.},

Abstract = {All North Sea countries are confronted by climate change impacts such as
   accelerated sea-level rise, increasing storm intensities resulting in as
   well higher set-up of storm surges as growing wave energy and a
   follow-up of morphological changes. Thus it is necessary to question the
   effectiveness of existing coastal protection strategies and to examine
   alternative strategies for coastal protection under a range of scenarios
   considered possible. Scenarios of accelerating sea-level rise leading to
   changes in sea level of up to 1 m or more by 2100 and higher set-up of
   storm surges with increasing wave energy have been used for planning
   purposes. Adaptation strategies for future coastal protection have been
   established in all North Sea countries with vulnerable coasts, observing
   two propositions: (1) structures are economic to construct in the short
   term and their dimensions easily adapted in the future to ensure
   flexibility in responding to the as yet undeterminable climate change
   impacts and (2) implementation of soft measures being temporarily
   effective and preventing counteraction to natural trends. The coastal
   protection strategies differ widely from country to country, not only in
   respect of distinct geographical boundary conditions but also in terms
   of the length of the planning period and the amount of regulations.
   Their further development is indispensable and emphasis must more and
   more be laid on strategies considering the effects of long-term
   development of coastal processes for future coastal protection. Filling
   gaps in knowledge is essential for developing sustainable adaptation
   strategies.},

Title = {Air temperature-related human health outcomes: Current impact and

Abstract = {The association between air temperature and human health is described in
   detail in a large amount of literature. However, scientific publications
   estimating how climate change will affect the population's health are
   much less extensive. In this study current evaluations and future
   predictions of the impact of temperature on human health in different
   geographical areas have been carried out. Non-accidental mortality and
   hospitalizations, and daily average air temperatures have been obtained
   for the 1999-2008 period for the ten main cities in Tuscany (Central
   Italy). High-resolution city-specific climatologic A1B scenarios
   centered on 2020 and 2040 have been assessed. Generalized additive and
   distributed lag models have been used to identify the relationships
   between temperature and health outcomes stratified by age: general
   adults (<65), elderly (aged 65-74) and very elderly (>= 75). The
   cumulative impact (over a lag-period of 30 days) of the effects of cold
   and especially heat, was mainly significant for mortality in the very
   elderly, with a higher impact on coastal plain than inland cities: 1
   degrees C decrease/increase in temperature below/above the threshold was
   associated with a 2.27\% (95\% CI: 0.17-4.93) and 15.97\% (95\% CI:
   7.43-24.51) change in mortality respectively in the coastal plain
   cities. A slight unexpected increase in short-term cold-related
   mortality in the very elderly, with respect to the baseline period, is
   predicted for the following years in half of the cities considered. Most
   cities also showed an extensive predicted increase in short-term
   heat-related mortality and a general increase in the annual
   temperature-related elderly mortality rate. These findings should
   encourage efforts to implement adaptation actions conducive to
   policy-making decisions, especially for planning short- and long-term
   health intervention strategies and mitigation aimed at preventing and
   minimizing the consequences of climate change on human health. (C) 2012

Title = {Impact of Urban Climate Landscape Patterns on Land Surface Temperature
   in Wuhan, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Facing urban warming, mitigation and adaptation strategies are not
   efficient enough to tackle excessive urban heat, especially at the local
   scale. The local climate zone (LCZ) classification scheme is employed to
   examine the diversity and complexity of the climate response within a
   city. This study suggests that zonal practice could be an efficient way
   to bridge the knowledge gap between climate research and urban planning.
   Urban surfaces classified by LCZ are designated as urban climate
   landscapes, which extends the LCZ concept to urban planning
   applications. Selecting Wuhan as a case study, we attempt to explore the
   climatic effect of landscape patterns. Thermal effects are compared
   across the urban climate landscapes, and the relationships between patch
   metrics and land surface temperature (LST) are quantified. Results
   indicate that climate landscape layout is a considerable factor
   impacting local urban climate. For Wuhan, 500 m is an optimal scale for
   exploring landscape pattern-temperature relationships. Temperature
   contrast between surrounding landscape patches has a major influence on
   LST. Generally, fragmental landscape patches contribute to heat release.
   For most climate landscape types, patch metrics also have a significant
   effect on thermal response. When three metrics are included as
   predictive variables, 53.3\% of the heating intensity variation can be
   explained for the Large Lowrise landscape, while 57.4\% of the cooling
   intensity variation can be explained for the Water landscape. Therefore,
   this article claims that land-based layout optimization strategy at
   local scale, which conforms to planning manner, should be taken into
   account in terms of heat management.},

Title = {Changes in atmospheric circulation and temperature trends in major

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2609-2621},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to knowledge of the impact of global warming on
   viticulture, using major vineyard regions of New Zealand as a case study
   to illustrate regional disparities in climate change impacts resulting
   from downscale effects of larger scale atmospheric circulation. Recent
   trends in air temperature in New Zealand vineyard areas are
   investigated. Trends since 1941 in Marlborough show an increase in
   temperature range, with both rising maximum temperatures and declining
   minimum temperatures, but no change in the annual mean. More hot days
   and frosts are of concern to viticulturalists, and this trend not only
   differs from other major vineyard areas, but also occurs at other sites
   in eastern parts of the country. The relationship between changes in
   atmospheric circulation over New Zealand and observed trends in
   temperature and frost occurrence at Blenheim is investigated using the
   Kidson weather type classification for the period 1958-2010 and the
   Trenberth M1 index. The increased temperature range is expected to be
   associated with more frequent clear skies along the east coast of the
   country, resulting from changes in weather patterns (more frequent
   anticyclones, fewer low-pressure systems, increased zonal and southerly
   flow). These changes in weather patterns are shown to be closely linked
   to larger scale changes in atmospheric circulation via the Southern
   Annular Mode (SAM) and Southern Oscillation. The results show that
   significant regional variations in the impact of global warming can
   occur over areas of complex terrain such as New Zealand. Observed
   differences in local temperature and frost trends can be caused by the
   interaction of changing weather systems with mountainous terrain. These
   changing weather systems themselves are seen to be the result of major
   shifts in the larger scale atmospheric circulation. These results are
   important for assessing possible impacts on viticulture and in
   developing adaptation strategies for agriculture in response to
   predicted future climates.},

Title = {Climate Change Migration and Displacement: Learning from Past
   Relocations in the Pacific},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It has been projected that the single greatest impact of environmental
   changes will be on human migration and displacement. Migration has been
   extensively discussed and documented as an adaptation strategy in
   response to environmental changes, and more recently, to climate change.
   However, forced relocation will lead to the displacement of people, and
   although much has been written about it, very little has been documented
   from the Pacific Islands perspective, especially by communities that
   were forced to relocate as a result of colonialism and those that have
   been forced to migrate today as a result of climate change impacts.
   Using the Gilbertese resettlement from the Phoenix Islands to the
   Solomon Islands, in particular, Wagina Island in the 1960s as a case
   study of forced relocation and displacement of Pacific Islands people
   during the colonial period, this paper aims to underline some of the
   important lessons that can be learned from this historical case to
   inform the present and future challenges of climate change migration and
   displacement. Without dismissing migration as a coping strategy, the
   paper argues that the forced relocation of people from their home
   islands as a result of climate change will lead to displacement. It
   accentuates that in the case of Pacific Islands, forced relocation will
   lead to displacement if they are forced to leave their land because of
   their deep relationship and attachment to it. The paper also emphasizes
   the need to acknowledge and honor Pacific Islands' voices and
   perceptions in discourses on climate change migration and displacement
   at national, regional and international forums.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island effect is one of the major issues and to be addressed
   in order to achieve sustainability. Human population in the cities has
   been increasing tremendously. As a result, natural areas are turned into
   buildings, roads etc. Scholars from various disciplines are now focused
   on the causes of Urban Heat Island effect and mitigation strategies.
   Considering the areas covered by the road pavements in the cities, its
   share on Urban Heat Island Effect is indisputable. Within the scope of
   this study a sample area was selected and modelled by utilizing various
   pavement materials. These areas have been investigated in terms of
   temperature, reflectance, view factor. The results are promising and
   likely to change the common beliefs. Pavements with higher albedos are
   helpful to reduce heat island effect of the non-naturalmaterials in the
   environments. The temperature difference can be 0.5 degrees C to 2
   degrees C.},

Abstract = {The `Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia
   and North West England' (RegIS) integrated assessment (IA) investigated
   climate and socio-economic impacts and adaptation options, and
   cross-sectoral interactions between four major sectors driving landscape
   change (agriculture, biodiversity, coastal zones and water resources).
   The baseline and two contrasting climate change scenarios (with and
   without regional socio-economic change scenarios) were investigated.
   RegIS showed that climate change, without policy adaptation, could lead
   to severe flood impacts in East Anglia, and significant agricultural
   abandonment. Despite yield changes, cropping is generally insensitive to
   climate, but very sensitive to socio-economic change. There is increased
   seasonality to river flows, compounded by increased urbanisation and
   irrigation demand. The responses of biodiversity to climate change are
   regional, habitat and species-specific, but much of the future of
   biodiversity in these regions will depend on planned adaptation in the
   other sectors. Numerous examples of public engagement with the global
   change sphere represent the real outward value of RegIS, due to the
   significant uncertainties and limitations to knowledge in this first
   regional IA which prevented results of the detail, specificity and
   confidence that decision-makers required. However, with further
   investment and refinement, regional IA's will increasingly provide such
   output.},

Abstract = {Conservation of marine species typically focuses on monitoring and
   mitigating demonstrated stressors where possible. Evidence is
   accumulating that some species will be negatively affected in the future
   by climate change and that reduction of existing stressors may not be
   sufficient to offset these impacts. Recent work suggests the shy
   albatross (Thalassarche cauta) will be adversely affected by projected
   changes in environmental conditions under plausible climate change
   scenarios. Furthermore, modelling shows that elimination of the
   principal present-day threat to albatrosses, fisheries bycatch, an
   achievable and critical priority, may not be sufficient to reverse
   projected population declines due to climate impacts, which cannot be
   directly eliminated. Here, a case study is presented in which a range of
   intervention options, in preparation for predicted climate change
   impacts, are identified and evaluated. A suite of 24 plausible climate
   adaptation options is first assessed using a semi-quantitative
   cost-benefit risk tool, leading to a relative ranking of actions. Of
   these options, increasing chick survival via reduction of disease
   prevalence through control of vectors, was selected for field trials.
   Avian insecticide was applied to chicks' mid-way through their
   development and the effect on subsequent survival was evaluated.
   Survival of treated chicks after six weeks was significantly higher
   (92.7\%) than those in control areas (82.1\%). This approach shows that
   options to enhance albatross populations exist and we argue that testing
   interventions prior to serious impacts can formalise institutional
   processes and allow refinement of actions that offer some chance of
   mitigating the impacts of climate change on iconic marine species. (C)

Title = {Co-benefits approach: Opportunities for implementing sponge city and
   urban heat island mitigation},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {147-157},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change and its impacts cannot be addressed once for all due to
   internal complexity. Some implemented strategies may only be capable of
   dealing with a cluster of problems while leaving many others untouched.
   The co-benefits approach, however, opens up a `window of opportunity'
   via achieving multi-goals simultaneously. Based on this, this paper aims
   to unpack the interrelationship between the struggling urban heat island
   (UHI) issue and the already ongoing sponge city (SPC) projects in China.
   Specifically, the co-benefits are investigated from technical,
   financial, institutional and social perspectives, after which pathways
   to implementation are presented. In these aspects, the co-benefits
   approach can bring opportunities for implementing SPC and UHI
   mitigation. The inclusion of UHI mitigation into SPC construction can
   enhance public participation and thereby consolidate the public-private
   partnership model for funds. During the co-benefits approach
   implementation, the weights of different authorities can be rebalanced
   to promote institutional transitions. SPC-derived UHI mitigation
   approach, potentially realising synergies of urban flooding and UHI
   mitigation, can be a model for countries which have already released
   low-impact development water management practices, and may also provide
   references for other projects such as green building, low-carbon
   eco-city, smart city, forest city and haze treatment for UHI mitigation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the current flood risk management practices in the
   Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. In the next four decades, 120 million
   people are expected to live in the region, which currently covers 11
   major cities, and includes the coastal megacities formed by Hong Kong
   and Shenzhen. These populous low-lying coastal cities experience
   emerging flood risk from (i) intense precipitation, (ii) storm surges,
   (iii) global sea level rise and (iv) rapid urbanization in the
   flood-prone areas. These have major economic, social and ecological
   impacts and have made it imperative to adopt a sustainable flood risk
   management strategy to mitigate these risks. This research uses the case
   study in Tai O and Shenzhen River sites from Hong Kong and Shenzhen
   where in-depth discussions were held with various stakeholders to
   overview and understand current constraints to realizing sustainable
   flood risk management (SFRM). The outcome shows the authorities have
   realized the importance of SFRM and climate change adaptation
   strategies. They seek further improvement in managing flood risk and
   preparing for unpredictable climatic regimes in both megacities, and by
   extension comparable urbanizing coastal cities in the PRD and East Asia.

Title = {Comparing the cost effectiveness of nature-based and coastal adaptation:
   A case study from the Gulf Coast of the United States},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Coastal risks are increasing from both development and climate change.
   Interest is growing in the protective role that coastal nature-based
   measures (or green infrastructure), such as reefs and wetlands, can play
   in adapting to these risks. However, a lack of quantitative information
   on their relative costs and benefits is one principal factor limiting
   their use more broadly. Here, we apply a quantitative risk assessment
   framework to assess coastal flood risk (from climate change and economic
   exposure growth) across the United States Gulf of Mexico coast to
   compare the cost effectiveness of different adaptation measures. These
   include nature-based (e.g. oyster reef restoration), structural or grey
   (e.g., seawalls) and policy measures (e.g. home elevation). We first
   find that coastal development will be a critical driver of risk,
   particularly for major disasters, but climate change will cause more
   recurrent losses through changes in storms and relative sea level rise.
   By 2030, flooding will cost \$134 +/- 176.6 billion (for different
   economic growth scenarios), but as the effects of climate change, land
   subsidence and concentration of assets in the coastal zone increase,
   annualized risk will more than double by 2050 with respect to 2030.
   However, from the portfolio we studied, the set of cost-effective
   adaptation measures (with benefit to cost ratios above 1) could prevent
   up to \$57 +/- 101 billion in losses, which represents 42.8 +/- 57.2\%
   of the total risk. Nature-based adaptation options could avert more than
   \$50 billion of these costs, and do so cost effectively with average
   benefit to cost ratios above 3.5. Wetland and oyster reef restoration
   are found to be particularly cost-effective. This study demonstrates
   that the cost effectiveness of nature-based, grey and policy measures
   can be compared quantitatively with one another, and that the cost
   effectiveness of adaptation becomes more attractive as climate change
   and coastal development intensifies in the future. It also shows that
   investments in nature-based adaptation could meet multiple objectives
   for environmental restoration, adaptation and flood risk reduction.},

Title = {Flexibility for intergenerational justice in climate resilience
   decision-making: an application on sea-level rise in the Netherlands},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Abstract = {To adapt to a changing climate, decision-makers design, evaluate, and
   implement measures that have an implication of justice on citizens in
   the present and well into the future. Decision-makers are often required
   to make decisions without certainty of the consequences and
   understanding their effects on intergenerational justice. Thus, managing
   the impacts of climate change requires novel decision-aiding approaches
   that consider climate impacts' temporal and spatial heterogeneity and
   the uncertainty in climate predictions, preferences, and values. We
   reviewed the literature on the extent to which principles of
   intergenerational justice-conservation of options and resources for
   future generations-have been integrated to traditional approaches in
   climate resilience decision-making. We explore the extent to which
   flexibility, i.e., the conservation and expansion of options in
   subsequent decision periods, can contribute to upholding the principles
   of intergenerational justice under uncertainty. We illustrate the
   approach in the case of the Delta Programme in the Netherlands, a
   complex system designed to protect against sea-level rise (SLR).
   Designing adaptation strategies to SLR with flexibility as a core
   concept brings significant advantages in circumstances of uncertainty.
   The conservation of options in flexible pathways, in this case,
   contributes to the principles of intergenerational justice. Our
   civilization's long-term sustainability and survival may depend on the
   extent to which individuals can see beyond their gains and toward the
   gains of the collective society at an intergenerational scale.},

Title = {An evidence based approach to evaluating flood adaptation effectiveness
   including climate change considerations for coastal cities: City of Port
   Phillip, Victoria, Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coastal cities provide a modelling challenge as surface flow is strongly
   affected by urban drainage networks and there is interaction between
   coastal and inland flooding. We present a graphics processing unit
   (GPU)-based hydrodynamic model coupled to a hydraulic network that
   integrates adaptation analysis in the context of current and future
   flooding. The hydrodynamic model is based on a finite volume
   implementation of the shallow water equations formulated for overland
   flow. The hydraulic network is based on a pressure relaxation method,
   and uses a GPU-based sparse matrix solver for computational speed. The
   integrated model is used for modelling potential combined coastal and
   catchment inundation and climate adaptation analysis for the City of
   Port Phillip, Victoria, Australia. The key outcome from the adaptation
   study was that resources spent towards adaptation infrastructure should
   be investigated in the context of sea level rise (SLR) at least for the
   next 50 years. The adaptation analysis identified ``a tipping point{''}
   beyond a SLR of around 0.4 m (expected in the next 30 years) where
   conventional adaptation approaches will fail. This outcome has resulted
   in the City realising that significant changes in infrastructure for the
   region will be necessary rather than just incremental adaptation
   approaches to deal with future flooding.},

Title = {An integrated spatial planning model for climate change adaptation in
   coastal zones},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This research highlights the spatial planning approach for coastal
   sustainability and adaptation to climate change. The dilemma of spatial
   planning in a dynamic and complex coastal environment as well as the
   establishment of a coastal buffer zone as an adaptation measure for
   climate change are elaborated upon. In particular, this study outlines
   the limitations of two of the traditional approaches used for spatial
   planning (optimization and simulation) and the opportunities that
   present themselves when combining both models for coastal zone planning.
   As a result, this study has developed an integrated modeling framework
   called MOPSD (multi-Objective Programming and System Dynamic) that can
   be used for spatial land use planning in coastal areas. The case study
   is Cijin Island, located next to the Kaohsiung harbor, Taiwan; this
   location demonstrates that the proposed MOPSD modeling approach
   generates superior results when compared to each of the two traditional
   methods. This is mainly attributed to the consideration of deterministic
   and dynamic characteristics when evaluating the climate change
   adaptation at risk of coastal erosion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {764-777},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Deliberative democracy has increasingly been used as a form of citizen
   engagement and involvement in risk-related and environmental domains.
   However, there is much to learn about how citizens talk about and
   understand risks related to climate change in the context of community
   deliberative forums, and how deliberation might contribute to productive
   climate policy solutions. To contribute to this growing body of work, we
   use the lens of Construal Level Theory (CLT) to analyze transcripts from
   a large community forum held in the US state of South Carolina. Our
   analysis reveals a broad range of risk construal from deliberative
   participants, with many people discussing climate risks as
   psychologically near despite the longer horizon often associated with
   climate change. The results suggest that deliberative forums can be
   useful venues for helping citizens grapple with the myriad risks and
   construal levels associated with climate change. Rather than simply
   helping move climate risks `closer' to people, deliberation might be
   more useful in allowing people to understand climate risks at multiple
   levels of psychological distance and leveraging this nuanced
   understanding to develop potential solutions and mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Tackling climate change requires a rapid transition to net-zero energy
   systems. A variety of different technologies could contribute to this
   transition, and uncertainty remains over their relative role and value.
   A growing school of thought argues that rapid cost reductions in
   renewables reduce the need for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in
   mitigation pathways. Here we use an integrated assessment model to
   explore how the value of CCS is affected by cost reductions in solar
   photovoltaics, onshore, and offshore wind. Low-cost renewables could
   erode the value of CCS by 15\%-96\% across different energy sectors.
   Renewables directly compete with CCS, accelerate power sector
   decarbonization, and enable greater electrification of end-use sectors.
   CCS has greatest value and resilience to low-cost renewables in
   sustainable bioenergy/industrial applications, with limited value in
   hydrogen/electricity generation. This suggests that targeted, rather
   than blanket, CCS deployment represents the best strategy for achieving
   the Paris Agreement goals.},

Abstract = {Rice is the principle staple crop of Asia and any deterioration of rice
   production systems through climate change would seriously impair food
   security in this continent. This review assesses spatial and temporal
   vulnerabilities of different rice production systems to climate change
   impacts in Asia. Initially, the review discusses the risks of increasing
   heat stress and maps the regions where current temperatures are already
   approaching critical levels during the susceptible stages of the rice
   plant, namely Pakistan/north India (Oct.), south India (April, Aug.),
   east India/Bangladesh (March-June), Myanmar/Thailand/Laos/Cambodia
   (March-June), Vietnam (April/Aug.), Philippines (April/June), Indonesia
   (Aug.) and China (July/Aug.). Possible adaptation options for heat
   stress are derived from regions where the rice crop is already exposed
   to very high temperatures including Iran and Australia. Drought stress
   is also expected to aggravate through climate change; a map
   superimposing the distribution of rainfed rice and precipitation
   anomalies in Asia highlights especially vulnerable areas in east
   India/Bangladesh and Myanmar/Thailand.
   Then, the review gives emphasis to two rice growing environments that
   have outstanding importance for food supply in Asia and, at the same
   time, are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. The mega-deltas in
   Vietnam, Myanmar and Bangladesh are the backbone of the rice economy in
   the respective country and will experience specific climate change
   impacts due to sea level rise. Significant improvements of the rice
   production systems, that is, higher resilience to flooding and salinity,
   are crucial for maintaining or even increasing yield levels in these
   very productive deltaic regions. The other `hotspot' with especially
   high climate change risks in Asia is the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP)
   which will be affected by the melting of the Himalayan glaciers. The
   dominant land use type in the IGP is rice-wheat rotation, and we discuss
   specific vulnerabilities and possible adaptation options in the
   different sub-regions of the IGP We conclude that geo-spatial
   vulnerability assessments may become crucial for planning targeted
   adaptation programs, but that policy frameworks are needed for their
   implementation.},

Title = {Extended ecological footprint for different modes of urban public
   transport: The case of Vienna, Austria},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {85-99},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urbanization and population growth in urban areas are linked to
   increasing passenger transport and decreasing land availability. One
   option to cope with the negative impacts associated to this growth (i.e.
   emissions from and land use by traffic) is to strengthen public
   transport, as it has lower land requirements and higher transportation
   capacities if compared to private passenger transport by cars. Besides
   the direct land use within the city borders, transportation systems also
   cause land use in the hinterland, particularly for the extraction of raw
   materials, for energy supply, and for the sequestration of greenhouse
   gas emissions. The study at hand investigated these types of land uses
   of a multimodal public passenger transport network consisting of subway,
   tram, and bus transport, taking the case study of Vienna. The land uses
   distinguished were the direct land use in the city, the direct land use
   in the global hinterland to provide energy and resources, and the land
   needed to sequestrate the CO2 emissions emitted. For the latter a
   distinction between the CO2 emissions from energy consumption
   (operational energy CO2 hinterland use), and from CO2 embodied in goods
   and materials (embodied CO2 hinterland use) was made. The overall land
   use of the public transport system was finally determined and
   illustrated using an extended ecological footprint (EF) analysis under
   consideration of the life cycle of used goods and materials.
   Results were expressed in global hectare (gha/a) for one year and
   further normalized to the transport capacity and performance of each
   transport mode. Results indicate that the operational energy CO2
   hinterland use contributes most to the overall land use (55,000 gha/a),
   followed by the embodied CO2 energy hinterland use (15,000 gha/a), the
   direct hinterland use (1,660 gha/a) and the direct land use within the
   city (620 ha). This sums up to a total of 72,500 gha/a, which,
   considering Vienna's population of 1.8 million inhabitants, equals 0.03
   gha/capita.a. The direct land use within the city corresponds to 1.5\%
   of city area and 1\% of the EF. Divided by transport mode, the subway
   has the largest EF (51\%) followed by busses (20\%), trams (19\%), and
   services (10\%). However, the ranking changes when the transport
   performance is considered. In general it can be taken from the results
   that the specific environmental efficiency (specific land use per seat
   kilometer provided) is increasing with growing offer of service per
   route. Due to the fact that infrastructural and non-operational energy
   impacts (e.g. construction materials, station lighting and heating) are
   not increasing substantially with a higher succession of trains the
   effect is even higher by rail-bound systems. However, if the required
   transport capacity per hour falls below a certain limit, subways and
   trams are not only economical, but also environmental less efficient
   than bus systems.},

Title = {Implementation arrangements for climate adaptation in the Netherlands:
   characteristics and underlying mechanisms of adaptive governance},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is a rapidly emerging policy domain. Over
   the last decade we have witnessed many attempts to enhance the climate
   robustness of agriculture, urban development, water systems, and nature
   to an increase in flood and drought risks due to a higher variability in
   rainfall patterns and sea level rise. In the vulnerable Dutch delta,
   regional authorities have developed adaptation measures that deal with
   flood risk, the availability of fresh water, subsidence, and salt water
   intrusion. In view of all the uncertainties that surround climate
   change, scientists emphasize that it should be possible to make changes
   when conditions change or insights evolve. The concept of adaptive
   governance has been introduced to facilitate the process of climate
   adaptation. Adaptive governance requires the availability of governance
   arrangements that facilitate adaptiveness by being flexible to enable
   adjustment. Although flexible arrangements for adaptation to climate
   change make sense from an adaptive governance perspective, from a more
   bureaucratic, political, and legal perspective, there might be good
   reasons to make arrangements as solid and robust as possible. In this
   article we answer the question to what extent the arrangements used to
   implement various adaptation measures are really adaptive and what
   mechanisms play a role in obstructing the accomplishment of adaptive
   arrangements. By analyzing and comparing nine adaptation cases, dealing
   with different climate issues, and the arrangements used to implement
   them from both a governance and a legal perspective, we are able to get
   more detailed insight into the main characteristics of the selected
   arrangements, their degree of adaptiveness, and the main hampering
   mechanisms for the creation or functioning of adaptive arrangements.},

Title = {Contributions of nature-based solutions to reducing people's
   vulnerabilities to climate change across the rural Global South},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NbS); working with and enhancing nature to
   address societal challenges, increasingly feature in climate change
   adaptation strategies. Despite growing evidence that NbS can reduce
   vulnerability to climate change impacts in general, understanding of the
   mechanisms through which this is achieved, particularly in the Global
   South, is lacking. To address this, we analyse 85 nature-based
   interventions across the rural Global South, and factors mediating their
   effectiveness, based on a systematic map of peer-reviewed studies
   encompassing a wide diversity of ecosystems, climate impacts, and
   intervention types. We apply an analytical framework of people's
   social-ecological vulnerability to climate change, in terms of six
   pathways of vulnerability reduction: social and ecological exposure,
   sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Most cases (95\%) report a reduction
   in vulnerability, primarily by lowering ecosystem sensitivity to climate
   impacts (73\% of interventions), followed by reducing social sensitivity
   (52\%), reducing ecological exposure (36\%), increasing social adaptive
   capacity (31\%), increasing ecological adaptive capacity (19\%) and/or
   reducing social exposure (14\%). Our analysis shows that social
   dimensions of NBS are important mediating factors for equity and
   effectiveness. This study highlights how understanding the distinct
   social and ecological pathways by which vulnerability to climate change
   is reduced can help harness the multiple benefits of working with nature
   in a warming world.},

Title = {Ten new insights in climate science 2021: a horizon scan},
Journal = {GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Non-technical summary We summarize some of the past year's most
   important findings within climate change-related research. New research
   has improved our understanding about the remaining options to achieve
   the Paris Agreement goals, through overcoming political barriers to
   carbon pricing, taking into account non-CO2 factors, a well-designed
   implementation of demand-side and nature-based solutions, resilience
   building of ecosystems and the recognition that climate change
   mitigation costs can be justified by benefits to the health of humans
   and nature alone. We consider new insights about what to expect if we
   fail to include a new dimension of fire extremes and the prospect of
   cascading climate tipping elements. Technical summary A synthesis is
   made of 10 topics within climate research, where there have been
   significant advances since January 2020. The insights are based on input
   from an international open call with broad disciplinary scope. Findings
   include: (1) the options to still keep global warming below 1.5 degrees
   C; (2) the impact of non-CO2 factors in global warming; (3) a new
   dimension of fire extremes forced by climate change; (4) the increasing
   pressure on interconnected climate tipping elements; (5) the dimensions
   of climate justice; (6) political challenges impeding the effectiveness
   of carbon pricing; (7) demand-side solutions as vehicles of climate
   mitigation; (8) the potentials and caveats of nature-based solutions;
   (9) how building resilience of marine ecosystems is possible; and (10)
   that the costs of climate change mitigation policies can be more than
   justified by the benefits to the health of humans and nature. Social
   media summary How do we limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C and why is
   it crucial? See highlights of latest climate science.},

Title = {Bayesian change point quantile regression approach to enhance the
   understanding of shifting phytoplankton-dimethyl sulfide relationships
   in aquatic ecosystems},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {201},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) serves as an anti-greenhouse gas, plays multiple
   roles in aquatic ecosystems, and contributes to the global sulfur cycle.
   The chlorophyll a (CHL, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass)-DMS
   relationship is critical for estimating DMS emissions from aquatic
   ecosystems. Importantly, recent research has identified that the CHL-DMS
   relationship has a breakpoint, where the relationship is positive below
   a CHL threshold and negative at higher CHL concentrations.
   Conventionally, mean regression meth-ods are employed to characterize
   the CHL-DMS relationship. However, these approaches focus on the
   re-sponse of mean conditions and cannot illustrate responses of other
   parts of the DMS distribution, which could be important in order to
   obtain a complete view of the CHL-DMS relationship. In this study, for
   the first time, we proposed a novel Bayesian change point quantile
   regression (BCPQR) model that inte-grates and inherits advantages of
   Bayesian change point models and Bayesian quantile regression models.
   Our objective was to examine whether or not the BCPQR approach could
   enhance the understanding of shifting CHL-DMS relationships in aquatic
   ecosystems. We fitted BCPQR models at five regression quan-tiles for
   freshwater lakes and for seas. We found that BCPQR models could provide
   a relatively complete view on the CHL-DMS relationship. In particular,
   it quantified the upper boundary of the relationship, representing the
   limiting effect of CHL on DMS. Based on the results of paired parameter
   comparisons, we revealed the inequality of regression slopes in BCPQR
   models for seas, indicating that applying the mean regression method to
   develop the CHL-DMS relationship in seas might not be appropriate. We
   also confirmed relationship differences between lakes and seas at
   multiple regression quantiles. Further, by introducing the concept of
   DMS emission potential, we found that pH was not likely a key factor
   leading to the change of the CHL-DMS relationship in lakes. These
   findings cannot be revealed using piecewise linear regression. We
   thereby concluded that the BCPQR model does indeed enhance the
   understand-ing of shifting CHL-DMS relationships in aquatic ecosystems
   and is expected to benefit effort s aimed at estimating DMS emissions.
   Considering that shifting (threshold) relationships are not rare and
   that the BCPQR model can easily be adapted to different systems, the
   BCPQR approach is expected to have great potential for generalization in
   other environmental and ecological studies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Impacts of jellyfish presence on tourists' holiday destination choices
   and their willingness to pay for mitigation measures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Recurrent jellyfish blooms in tourist areas have negative effects on
   coastal and national economies. We investigate how jellyfish presence
   affects holiday destination choice and how the adoption of mitigation
   measures can reduce impacts through analyzing tourists' preferences. A
   Discrete Choice Experiment approach was adopted to assess tourists'
   willingness to pay for different measures. Results indicate that in
   scenarios of increased jellyfish numbers, 24-40\% of tourists might not
   choose to return to a destination affected by jellyfish. Results also
   indicate that the adoption of measures such as jellyfish information
   provision, warning flags, health service presence or the deployment of
   jellyfish exclusion nets could reduce the proportion of non-returning
   tourists by 66-83\%. Regarding preferences, tourists are willing to pay
   higher amounts for measures that provide the highest protection. We
   conclude that the implementation of preventive management plans should
   be considered by coastal administrations to promote a sense of safety
   among tourists and residents alike.},

Title = {Assessing the impacts of climate change in cities and their adaptive

Abstract = {Many cities across the world are facing many problems climate change
   poses to their populations, communities and infrastructure. These vary
   from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat,
   depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even
   though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change
   challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing
   countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies
   which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities,
   and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good
   practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to
   address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the
   extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are
   attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which
   hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and
   good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable
   elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to
   climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across
   different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities
   (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities.
   In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they
   manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being
   implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of
   transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them
   in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient
   infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying
   to address their related poverty issues. This paper addresses a gap in
   the international literature on the problems many cities in developing
   countries face, in trying to adapt to a changing climate. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Nearly one-half of the residents of North and South Carolina use
   decentralized or onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). As the
   climate changes, coastal communities relying on OWTS are particularly
   vulnerable, as soil-based wastewater treatment may be reduced by water
   inundation from storm surge, sea level rise and associated groundwater
   rise, and heavy rainfall. Despite the vulnerabilities of OWTS to
   increased precipitation and sea level rise, there is little known about
   how onsite wastewater managers are responding to current and future
   climate risks. We conducted interviews with wastewater operators and
   installers and health regulators to understand the functioning,
   management, and regulation of OWTS in the current climate, challenges
   with rising sea levels and increases in extreme weather events, and what
   adaptation strategies could be implemented to mitigate negative impacts.
   Our results indicate that heavy precipitation and storm surges cause
   malfunctions for conventional septic systems where traditional site
   variables (e.g., soil type or groundwater level) are undesirable.
   Weather and climate are not required regulatory factors to consider in
   system selection and site approval, but many OWTS managers are aware of
   their impacts on the functioning of systems, and some are preemptively
   taking action to mitigate those impacts. Our findings suggest that
   filling gaps in the current communication structure between regulators
   and homeowners relying on OWTS is critical for coastal communities in
   the Carolinas to build climate resilience into decentralized wastewater
   infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Climate change is anticipated to exacerbate the extinction risk of
   species whose persistence is already compromised by habitat loss,
   invasive species, disease, or other stressors. In coastal areas of the
   southeastern United States (USA), many imperiled vertebrates are
   vulnerable to hurricanes, which climate models predict to become more
   severe in the 21st century. Despite this escalating threat, explicit
   adaptation strategies that address hurricane threats, in particular, and
   climate change more generally, are largely underrepresented in recovery
   planning and implementation. We provide a basis for stronger emphasis on
   strategic planning for imperiled species facing the increasing threat of
   catastrophic hurricanes. Our reasoning comes from observations of
   short-term environmental and biological impacts of Hurricane Michael,
   which impacted the Gulf Coast of the southeastern USA in October 2018.
   During this storm, St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, located along the
   northern Gulf of Mexico's coast in the panhandle region of Florida,
   received storm surge that was 3.0-3.6 m (NAVD88) above sea level. Storm
   surge pushed sea water into some ephemeral freshwater ponds used for
   breeding by the federally threatened frosted flatwoods salamander
   (Ambystoma cingulatum). After the storm, specific conductance across all
   ponds measured varied from 80 to 23,100 mu S/cm, compared to 75 to 445
   mu S/cm in spring 2018. For 17 overwashed wetlands that were measured in
   both spring and fall 2018, posthurricane conductance observations were,
   on average, more than 90 times higher than in the previous spring,
   setting the stage for varying population responses across this coastal
   landscape. Importantly, we found live individual flatwoods salamanders
   at both overwashed and non-overwashed sites, although we cannot yet
   assess the demographic consequences of this storm. We outline actions
   that could be incorporated into climate adaptation strategies and
   recovery planning for imperiled species, like A. cingulatum, that are
   associated with freshwater coastal wetlands in hurricane-prone regions.},

Title = {Development of an Urban Heat Mitigation Plan for the Greater Sacramento
   Valley, California, a Csa Koppen Climate Type},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {An urban atmospheric modeling study was undertaken with the goal of
   informing the development of a heat-mitigation plan for the greater
   Sacramento Valley, California. Realistic levels of mitigation measures
   were characterized and ranked in terms of their effectiveness in
   producing urban cooling under current conditions and future climate and
   land use. An urban heat-island index was computed for current and future
   climates based on each location's time-varying upwind temperature
   reference points and its hourly temperatures per coincident wind
   direction. For instance, the UHII for the period 16-31 July 2015, for
   all-hours averaged temperature equivalent (i.e., degrees C center dot h
   hr(-1)), ranged from 1.5 to 4.7 degrees C across the urban areas in the
   region. The changes in local microclimates corresponding to future
   conditions were then quantified by applying a modified high-resolution
   urban meteorology model in dynamically downscaling a climate model along
   with future urbanization and land use change projections for each area.
   It was found that the effects of urbanization were of the same magnitude
   as that of the local climate change. Considering the urban areas in the
   region and the selected emissions scenarios, the all-hours temperature
   equivalent of the UHII (degrees C center dot h hr(-1)) increased by
   between 0.24 and 0.80 degrees C, representing an increase of between
   17\% and 13\% of their respective values in the current climate.
   Locally, instantaneous (e.g., hourly) temperatures could increase by up
   to similar to 3 degrees C because of climate effects and up to similar
   to 5 degrees C because of both climate and urbanization changes. The
   efficacies of urban heat mitigation measures were ranked both at the
   county level and at local project scales. It was found that urban
   cooling measures could help decrease or offset exceedances in the
   National Weather Service heat index (NWS HI) above several warning
   thresholds and reduce the number of heatwave or excessive heat event
   days. For example, measures that combine increased albedo and urban
   forests can reduce the exceedances above NWS HI Danger level by between
   50\% and 100\% and the exceedances above Extreme Caution level by
   between 18\% and 36\%. UHII offsets from each mitigation measure were
   quantified for two situations: (1) a scenario where a community
   implements cooling measures and no other nearby communities take any
   action and (2) a scenario where both the community and its upwind
   neighbors implement cooling measures. In this second situation, the
   community benefits from cooler air transported from upwind areas in
   addition to the local cooling resulting from implementation of its own
   heat mitigation strategies. The modeling of future climates showed that
   except for a number of instances, the ranking of measures in each
   respective urban area remains unchanged into the future.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to predict changes in the distribution and
   extent of habitat forming species defined as ``Priority Marine
   Habitats{''} (PMHs) in the North-East (NE) Atlantic under future
   scenarios of climate-induced environmental change. A Species
   Distribution Modelling method was used for each PMH to map the potential
   distribution of ``most suitable{''} habitat. The area and percentage
   cover was calculated within each country's Exclusive Economic Zone for
   the baseline (2009) and the projected (2100) years. In addition, a
   conservation management score was calculated based on the number of PMHs
   that co-occur in assessment units. Overall, this study reveals the
   potential for movement and/or change in the extent of some PMHs across
   the NE Atlantic under an increased ocean temperature scenario (4 degrees
   C) by 2100. There are regional differences in the predicted changes and
   some countries will experience greater/different changes than others.
   The movement of biodiversity hotspots (where one or more PMHs occur in
   the same broad area) provides both opportunities and risks for
   conservation management that are discussed. Co-operation between
   neighbouring countries and marine regions will require substantial
   enhancement in order to provide a robust adaptive management strategy
   going forward. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Title = {IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON PLANNING AND DEALING WITH FLOOD DISASTERS IN
   SOUTH AFRICA: A CASE STUDY OF SOWETO ON SEA},
Journal = {AGREKON},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-132},
Abstract = {Climate change is an additional challenge for the African continent,
   which is already facing many challenges. It increases the uncertainty
   regarding the probability of flood occurrence, making weather less
   predictable, rainfall more uncertain but heavy storms more likely. This
   necessitates rethinking and changing the traditional ways of planning
   and dealing with floods. When flooding occurs according to a predictable
   pattern, an optimal package of flood damage control measures can be
   planned in advance, but when flood events become unpredictable due to
   climate change, the optimal package of flood damage control measures
   will change, cannot be planned with sufficient certainty in advance and
   different management strategies are needed. In this study a benefit cost
   analysis was applied to compare the merits of different structural flood
   mitigation options for Soweto-on-Sea, with and without climate change.
   The option with the highest net benefit remains the clearing out of the
   river channel for both (with and without) scenarios. In order to
   protect/improve the quality of life of the urban poor flood victims, the
   economic dimension of flood control planning, which is implied when
   using benefit cost analysis to select the best flood mitigation option,
   is insufficient. Besides the economic dimension, the social and
   environmental dimensions must also be included, suggesting that a
   multi-criteria decision analysis procedure be used.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {107},
Number = {1},
Pages = {831-852},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Deltas are in a constant state of flux owing to hazards such as
   flooding, sea erosion and human activities. Climate change will probably
   increase the incidence of coastal recession and flooding of deltas.
   Reducing the vulnerability of deltas/coastal zones requires
   comprehensive studies to plan appropriate adaptation policies. However,
   studies on the coastal hazards of Densu delta have been limited to a few
   localities and also of short-term periods of less than a decade. Owing
   to uncertainties of natural hazard processes long-time and cyclical
   analysis of coastal zones provides accurate data on the state of such
   physical forces and their impact on the landscape and human activities
   if habited. Accordingly, a holistic investigation of the hazards
   plaguing the deltaic coastline from a long-term perspective was
   undertaken to determine hazards plaguing the delta and investigate the
   causes and impacts on the livelihoods of residents, undertake a
   longer-term shoreline change analysis of the coastline, and have
   understanding on institutional management and coping strategies of
   residents to the hazards. Methods adopted for the study included
   interviews and focus group discussions, shoreline change analysis and
   field exploration. The study revealed that the Densu delta is plagued by
   floods and coastal recession which are affecting lives and properties.
   Several human and physical processes (e.g., sea-level rise, increasing
   rainfall, encroachment of reservations) were identified as drivers of
   these hazards. Government needs to resource local authorities and
   relevant statutory agencies to enable them effectively perform their
   roles regarding development planning in the locality to curb these
   hazards.},

Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {399-412},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change is already producing ecological, social, and economic
   impacts on fisheries, and these effects are expected to increase in
   frequency and magnitude in the future. Fisheries governance and
   regulations can alter socio-ecological resilience to climate change
   impacts via harvest control rules and incentives driving fisher
   behavior, yet there are no syntheses or conceptual frameworks for
   examining how institutions and their regulatory approaches can alter
   fisheries resilience to climate change. We identify nine key climate
   resilience criteria for fisheries socio-ecological systems (SES),
   defining resilience as the ability of the coupled system of interacting
   social and ecological components (i.e., the SES) to absorb change while
   avoiding transformation into a different undesirable state. We then
   evaluate the capacity of four fisheries regulatory systems that vary in
   their degree of property rights, including open access, limited entry,
   and two types of rights-based management, to increase or inhibit
   resilience. Our exploratory assessment of evidence in the literature
   suggests that these regulatory regimes vary widely in their ability to
   promote resilient fisheries, with rights-based approaches appearing to
   offer more resilience benefits in many cases, but detailed
   characteristics of the regulatory instruments are fundamental.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Land evaluation was applied to assess the productivity of sweet potato,
   taro, yam, sugar cane, and banana during the prehistoric period on Rapa
   Nui (1500-1700 AD). Pedological and ethno-archaeological fieldwork
   enabled an estimation of prehistoric data. Twelve soil profiles
   distributed over four sites, Akahanga, La Perouse, Tepeu, and Vaitea,
   were selected as land evaluation units. Six soil types, classified
   following the traditional Rapanui soil capability classification, served
   as test units. The land evaluation model took spatial and temporal
   precipitation variability, along with anthropogenic response, into
   account. Easter Island temperature and precipitation were assessed as
   close to optimal for sweet potato, rather moderate for banana and almost
   marginal for taro, yam and sugar cane. Dominant other limiting factors
   for moderate to marginal suitability were nutrient availability
   associated with andic soil properties and water availability following
   temporary precipitation deficit. Technical and organisational responses
   to these variables could have included lithic mulch, land use planning
   and supervision of food production. These adaptive strategies would have
   reduced the effect of climate variation and spread the risk of decreased
   yields. This rationale allows an understanding why prehistoric Rapanui
   people continued to produce well above the subsistence minimum, even
   under moderate or marginal production conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Declining oxygen is one of the most drastic changes in the ocean, and
   this trend is expected to worsen under future climate change scenarios.
   Spatial variability in dissolved oxygen dynamics and hypoxia exposures
   can drive differences in vulnerabilities of coastal ecosystems and
   resources, but documentation of variability at regional scales is rare
   in open-coast systems. Using a regional collaborative network of
   dissolved oxygen and temperature sensors maintained by scientists and
   fishing cooperatives from California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico,
   we characterize spatial and temporal variability in dissolved oxygen and
   seawater temperature dynamics in kelp forest ecosystems across 13
   degrees of latitude in the productive California Current upwelling
   system. We find distinct latitudinal patterns of hypoxia exposure and
   evidence for upwelling and respiration as regional drivers of oxygen
   dynamics, as well as more localized effects. This regional and
   small-scale spatial variability in dissolved oxygen dynamics supports
   the use of adaptive management at local scales, and highlights the value
   of collaborative, large-scale coastal monitoring networks for informing
   effective adaptation strategies for coastal communities and fisheries in
   a changing climate.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are known to be particularly
   vulnerable to climate change, which poses a challenge to their economic
   and social development. This vulnerability is expressed in several ways,
   from exposure to sea level rises, to salt intrusion, and extensive
   droughts in some areas. Despite this rather negative trend, there are
   examples of initiatives where the vulnerability of SIDS can be reduced,
   and their resilience may be increased. Based on the paucity of the
   literature on concrete examples of successful climate change adaptation
   initiatives on SIDS, this paper presents an overview of pertinent
   challenges faced, and introduces two case studies from the Solomon
   Islands, which illustrate how much can be achieved by systematically
   pursuing adaptation strategies. The lessons learned from these case
   studies are outlined and some useful insights are provided, which may
   help SIDS to better foster the development opportunities with climate
   change adaptation offers to them.},

Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {10-29},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite the rise in global attention to port managers' actions on
   climate change, they still face considerable challenges in reaching
   collective agreements on proactive policies and hands-on actions.
   Considering the influence of port as the middle-man of global trade and
   development, this study undertakes semantic, co-authorship, and
   geographic coverage analyses of major articles on port climate change
   adaptation to shed light on the evolution of research over last fifteen
   years. With semantic analyses, we extract material words and expressions
   of identified articles, based on their title and keywords, and discuss
   when they have been taken into consideration and how they have been
   jointly studied. Also, co-authorship analysis shows the formation and
   expansion of research communities. Finally, geographic coverage of
   research and geographic distribution of researchers explain to what
   extent this subject has been explored and knowledge has been
   disseminated around the globe. We hereby suggest that future research
   should claim adaptation leadership by a quick paradigm shift, to support
   timely decisions. It is time to move ahead, focusing more on adaptation
   actions and approaches to bridge adaptation gaps.},

Title = {Double exposures and decision making: adaptation policy and planning in
   Ireland's coastal cities during a boom-bust cycle},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {45},
Number = {6},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The importance of the interactions between global environmental and
   socioeconomic changes in shaping vulnerability and exposure to hazards
   is now increasingly recognised. However, relatively little attention has
   been focused on the ways in which these interactions help to shape
   planning and policy in response to both processes. This paper examines
   how the intersections between the twin crises of economic recession and
   climate change are influencing hazards mitigation policy and climate
   change adaptation planning in three of Ireland's coastal cities. The
   cities of Dublin, Cork, and Galway are important case studies for this
   analysis due to the magnitude of socioeconomic and environmental changes
   they have witnessed in recent years. The paper begins by using the
   double-exposure framework to analyse how the interactions between global
   environmental and socioeconomic change have produced the contextual
   environment within which decision making and policy formation take
   place. This is followed by the presentation and analysis of the results
   of semistructured interviews with local decision makers and
   stakeholders. These illustrate that the interactions between
   environmental change and economic crisis have created the material and
   ideological conditions in which a neoliberal growth centred discourse of
   economic development dominates all areas of decision making and- policy.
   This has important implications for environmental policy and planning in
   cities, promoting a vision of a modern competitive city in which
   technological solutions are the preferred means of addressing flood
   risks. These decisions in turn reshape the exposures and vulnerabilities
   of local communities.},

Abstract = {Like many issues in environmental law and governance, climate change
   adaptation planning involves difficult policy trade-offs.
   Decision-makers must balance competing public and private interests and
   short-and long-term concerns against a background of considerable
   uncertainty and complexity. One of the classic challenges of
   environmental governance is to establish laws and other institutions
   which support long-term decision-making in the public interest and this
   is equally a challenge for adaptation planning. This article explores
   Australian approaches to such policy trade-offs in the context of
   spatial planning for bushfire and coastal hazards. These examples
   illustrate the difficulties of considering cumulative, longer term
   environmental impacts of adaptation measures in the face of immediate
   and known risks to existing private property and infrastructure, and the
   way in which current decision-making downplays these public values. The
   authors identify institutional factors that help to explain this bias
   and propose strategies to improve protection of public interest
   environmental values in adaptation planning.},

Abstract = {Interactions between seabirds and longline fishing can cause incidental
   bird mortality and reduced gear efficiency. The potential for solving
   these problems by using a bird-scaring streamer line and a line shooter
   was investigated in commercial longlining in the northern Atlantic off
   the coast of Norway. We compared the bycatch rate of northern fulmars
   Fulmarus glacialis, the loss rate of baits to fulmars and the catch
   rates of fish target species among lines set with either of these
   mitigation measures, a combination of both and no mitigation measure. A
   total of 58,420 hooks were set in each of the four treatments. No birds
   were caught using the bird-scaring line alone and a single fulmar was
   caught when the bird-scaring line was used in combination with the line
   shooter. In contrast, 32 fulmars were caught in sets with no mitigation
   device and thirteen in sets with the line shooter alone. Losses of
   mackerel bait were reduced when the bird-scaring line was used, but not
   by using the line shooter alone. Longlines set with the line shooter
   reached 3 m depth 15\% faster then lines set without the line shooter;
   beyond this depth sinking rates were similar (about 15 cm s(-1)). Fish
   catch did not vary significantly among setting methods. These results
   should also be applicable to the bycatch of Fulmarus spp. in demersal
   longline fisheries worldwide. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {Physiology can contribute to better understanding, management, and
   conservation of coral reef fishes},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Coral reef fishes, like many other marine organisms, are affected by
   anthropogenic stressors such as fishing and pollution and, owing to
   climate change, are experiencing increasing water temperatures and ocean
   acidification. Against the backdrop of these various stressors, a
   mechanistic understanding of processes governing individual organismal
   performance is the first step for identifying drivers of coral reef fish
   population dynamics. In fact, physiological measurements can help to
   reveal potential cause-and-effect relationships and enable physiologists
   to advise conservation management by upscaling results from cellular and
   individual organismal levels to population levels. Here, we highlight
   studies that include physiological measurements of coral reef fishes and
   those that give advice for their conservation. A literature search using
   combined physiological, conservation and coral reef fish key words
   resulted in similar to 1900 studies, of which only 99 matched predefined
   requirements. We observed that, over the last 20 years, the combination
   of physiological and conservation aspects in studies on coral reef
   fishes has received increased attention. Most of the selected studies
   made their physiological observations at the whole organism level and
   used their findings to give conservation advice on population dynamics,
   habitat use or the potential effects of climate change. The precision of
   the recommendations differed greatly and, not surprisingly, was least
   concrete when studies examined the effects of projected climate change
   scenarios. Although more and more physiological studies on coral reef
   fishes include conservation aspects, there is still a lack of concrete
   advice for conservation managers, with only very few published examples
   of physiological findings leading to improved management practices. We
   conclude with a call to action to foster better knowledge exchange
   between natural scientists and conservation managers to translate
   physiological findings more effectively in order to obtain
   evidence-based and adaptive management strategies for the conservation
   of coral reef fishes.},

Title = {Building adaptive capacity in a changing Arctic by use of technology},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rapid Arctic warming, manifested as thawing permafrost, loss of coastal
   sea ice, sea level rise, and climate-related extreme events, is
   particularly challenging for Indigenous people relying on wild food to
   sustain their livelihood and culture. The adoption of new technologies
   could provide specific capabilities to confront vulnerabilities
   associated with fishing and hunting activities, but it could also
   accentuate existing vulnerabilities of the communities and undermine the
   generic (i.e., non-specific) adaptive capacities to respond to rapid
   environmental and socioeconomic changes. We investigated the role of
   technology for building capacity to respond to challenges posed by
   climate change in three remote communities in northwest Arctic Alaska.
   We refer to technology as tools used to change how people engage or
   relate to landscape or society. We interviewed 35 Inuit subsistence
   users and used Q-sort methodologies to examine their attitudes toward
   technology and climate change adaptation. Communication technologies and
   new ways of transport have allowed harvesters to travel faster and
   further, and 89\% of the interviewees underscored the role of technology
   for enhancing the specific capacity to cope with extreme weather (77\%),
   foggy conditions (60\%), and environmental changes (89\%). Despite of
   the role technology plays in enhancing the capacity to respond to
   climate threats, just over half viewed technology as generally favorable
   for the community (54\%), although most admitted there are downsides
   (60\%), including higher financial costs (34\%), increased vulnerability
   (23\%), and time spent on maintenance (9\%). Our results underscore the
   need to focus on generic capacity when developing climate adaptation
   policies for Arctic Alaska to attend to both climatic and non-climatic
   stressors affecting the vulnerability of Indigenous communities.},

Abstract = {Each year, natural disasters cause countless deaths and formidable
   damage to infrastructure and the environment. In 2004-2005, more than
   200 000 people lost their lives in natural disasters. Material damage
   was estimated at USD 300 billion. Many lives could have been saved if
   more had been known about forecasting and mitigation. The need to
   improve the ability to deal with the hazards and risks was accentuated
   by increased sliding and flooding in many regions around the world in
   recent years, concern for their disastrous consequences on mankind,
   infrastructure and material property and the catastrophic Indian Ocean
   tsunami in December 2004. One of the most common natural disasters is
   landslides caused by heavy precipitation, floods, earthquakes and
   erosion, and by anthropogenic actions. Many of the casualties reported
   after rainstorms, large floods and earthquakes are actually caused by
   the landslides triggered by these events. Studies show that developing
   countries are greatly affected by landslides. Of the total number of
   persons who died due to natural disasters, highly developed countries
   count only 5\% of the casualties. Material damage in Industrialized
   countries is however greatest. International collaboration is needed to
   reduce losses in countries where the landslide risk is high. The
   measures for effective mitigation require solutions encompassing the
   technological and the societal perspectives, which demonstrate the
   importance and challenge of a multi-disciplinary approach, where
   scientists and engineers need to interact and communicate freely with
   partners with entirely different backgrounds. The paper presents recent
   work on the assessment, mitigation and management of landslide risk,
   including several examples. Societal aspects risk, are considered. Early
   warning systems have gained strong interest in recent years. The paper
   goes into the principles and elements of early warning systems, the key
   factors for success and some of the available technology. Society and
   technologists need to invest into the mitigation of landslide hazard and
   risk to improve the reliability and efficiency of the results obtained.},

Title = {Spatiotemporally explicit prediction of future ecosystem service
   provisioning in response to climate change, sea level rise, and
   adaptation strategies},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We present a framework to relate the provision of multiple, interacting
   ecosystem services to climate change and land use adaptation, by
   combining hydrological process models with statistical species'
   distribution models and transfer functions to upscale plot data to the
   landscape scale. Functional traits of the projected plant communities
   predict provisional and species conservation services, whereas the
   hydrological model predicts water-related regulatory services. We
   applied the framework to coastal areas of the Baltic Sea to predict
   future ecosystem service outputs in yearly time steps from 2010 to 2100,
   based on a `high emissions' climate change scenario, a projected
   sea-level rise of 1.05 m, and four land-management options corresponding
   to future coastal adaptation strategies. The ``Hold the line{''}
   strategy implies continual pumping of excess rainwater into the sea to
   allow farm income from grassland usage, together with high conservation
   values for rare plants and meadow birds. Towards the end of the century,
   with an increasing sea-level rise, this results in reverse groundwater
   flows from sea to land and soil salinization of grasslands. Conversely,
   ``managed realignment{''} implies the abandonment of pumping, thereby
   changing grasslands to reeds, reducing farm income and species
   conservation values, but promoting water retention and carbon
   sequestration by peat production. Between 2010 and 2100, the time series
   averaged across all landscape patches masked substantial spatial shifts
   in the outputs of ecosystem services from lower to higher elevations,
   emphasizing the relevance of considering both time and
   space.Multifunctional landscapes, by compromising between provisioning
   and regulatory ecosystem services, may create the response diversity
   needed to successfully adapt to climate change and sea-level rise.},

Abstract = {Climate change may affect human health through multiple and interactive
   pathways that include safe water scarcity. However, impacts of climate
   change-induced water scarcity on health and well-being are complex.
   About 80\% of illnesses in developing countries are attributed to unsafe
   drinking water and waterborne diseases. In Southwestern Bangladesh, lack
   of safe drinking water is a severe crisis due to climate change. The
   study investigated the impacts of climate change on water resources and
   human health in a coastal area. A questionnaire survey was carried out
   in two villages of Shymnagar upazila on the southwestern coast to
   investigate the present status of safe water sources and health care
   facilities and their impacts on the local community. The results show
   that the local community believes that climate change is having
   substantial impacts on freshwater sources and health. More than 70\% of
   the respondents identified diarrhea, dysentery, and skin diseases as the
   prime waterborne health risks that occur through climate-related safe
   water scarcity. By synthesizing the ground data, we suggest pathways to
   health adaptation to climate change effects and safe water scarcity
   through locally available adaptive practices such as the use of pond
   sand filters, rainwater harvesting, and importing potable water with the
   active participation of the government, nongovernmental organizations,
   and communities.},

Title = {Bycatch governance and best practice mitigation technology in global
   tuna fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {590-609},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Overexploitation of bycatch and target species in marine capture
   fisheries is the most widespread and direct driver of change and loss of
   global marine biodiversity. Bycatch in purse seine and pelagic longline
   tuna fisheries, the two primary gear types for catching tunas, is a
   primary mortality source of some populations of seabirds, sea turtles,
   marine mammals and sharks. Bycatch of juvenile tunas and unmarketable
   species and sizes of other fish in purse seine fisheries, and juvenile
   swordfish in longline fisheries, contributes to the overexploitation of
   some stocks, and is an allocation issue. There has been substantial
   progress in identifying gear technology solutions to seabird and sea
   turtle bycatch on longlines and to direct dolphin mortality in purse
   seines. Given sufficient investment, gear technology solutions are
   probably feasible for the remaining bycatch problems. More comprehensive
   consideration across species groups is needed to identify conflicts as
   well as mutual benefits from mitigation methods. Fishery-specific
   bycatch assessments are necessary to determine the efficacy, economic
   viability, practicality and safety of alternative mitigation methods.
   While support for gear technology research and development has generally
   been strong, political will to achieve broad uptake of best practices
   has been lacking. The five Regional Fisheries Management Organizations
   have achieved mixed progress mitigating bycatch. Large gaps remain in
   both knowledge of ecological risks and governance of bycatch. Most
   binding conservation and management measures fall short of gear
   technology best practice. A lack of performance standards, in
   combination with an inadequate observer coverage for all but large
   Pacific purse seiners, and incomplete data collection, hinders assessing
   measures' efficacy. Compliance is probably low due to inadequate
   surveillance and enforcement. Illegal, unreported and unregulated tuna
   fishing hampers governance efforts. Replacing consensus-based
   decision-making and eliminating opt-out provisions would help.
   Instituting rights-based management measures could elicit improved
   bycatch mitigation practices. While gradual improvements in an
   international governance of bycatch can be expected, market-based
   mechanisms, including retailers and their suppliers working with
   fisheries to gradually improve practices and governance, promise to be
   expeditious and effective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   sustainability and is central to climate change research and planning.
   This paper addresses three questions: what is the best way to measure
   community resilience to disasters and how to identify the key
   indicators? How do the resilience indicators dynamically interact in a
   quantitative manner that would lead to long-term resilience? And how can
   we translate the scientific results into practical tools for decision
   making? Using the population change pattern in the Mississippi River
   Delta as a case study, this paper demonstrates the use of a relatively
   new resilience assessment method called the Resilience Inference
   Measurement (RIM) method to measure resilience. Then, a newly developed
   spatial dynamic model is used to simulate population changes in the
   study area. The results show that without any changes in the current
   condition, the coastal portion of the study area will continue to suffer
   population loss and the region is unlikely to sustain in the future.},

Abstract = {A rich corpus of literature exists on traveling knowledges, their
   carriers, and connectivities. Yet there is less emphasis on how
   trajectories of mobility themselves, and the knowledges that circulate
   coevolve in the process of travel. In this article, we propose
   ``epistemic mobilities{''} as a conceptual lens with which to
   empirically trace the transfer and translation of knowledges and
   practices as they come to be embedded in existing and new social
   realities. We draw inspiration from technological and policy
   interventions for living with sea-level change across two cases studies
   on Jakarta and Manila, and ask how these policies and practices
   constantly morph when being translated into specific sociopolitical and
   ecological contexts. We argue that the translocal transforming of
   adaptation practices and policies, within their contexts of arrival and
   negotiation, are key to conceptualizing ``epistemic mobilities{''} via
   local systems and processes of socioinstitutional change.},

Abstract = {Through a practical application in the municipality of
   Riviere-au-Tonnerre on the Northern coast of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence,
   this article explores the advantages of using a vision of future desired
   conditions for planning adaptation to climate change. Such an approach
   was used in small kitchen meetings for the elaboration of an adaptation
   action plan that was approved by the municipal council in September 2013
   and revised in November 2014. The impacts of climate hazards were
   discussed as obstacles to the desired future conditions expressed by
   participants. This approach allowed the planning of a number of
   adaptation options, to define roles and responsibilities of different
   actors involved and to articulate different plans that are either in
   existence or being developed, linking them with adaptation. Based on our
   observations and on other studies in the fields of social movements,
   psychology and risk perception, we suggest that the use of a vision in
   discussion meetings with local actors could increase their motivation by
   placing the avoidance of undesired situations in the context of reaching
   their aspirations, in other words by embedding a prevention problem in
   promotion logic. The expression of a vision of a desired future could
   allow them to express their values and could facilitate the framing of a
   plan in a way that is coherent with them. The visions could then also be
   used to frame awareness-raising activities along the values they
   express.},

Abstract = {In recent years island communities have actively adapted in response to
   a complex combination of changes that has shaped life on the islands,
   and this has had gendered consequences. The gender ramifications of
   adaptation on islands are still largely neglected in adaptation
   policies, although they are increasingly being addressed in the
   scientific literature. Understanding gendered consequences is
   indispensable for a critical comprehension of adaptation on islands. It
   would help avoid the formulation of adaptation policies that tend to
   focus only on technical problems and solutions. Such solutions
   potentially run the risk of reducing island problems to only biophysical
   issues such as sea level rise or problems attributed to the size and
   isolation of the islands. This paper investigates the consequences of
   adaptation for the mobility of both women and men on two islands in the
   Maldives, a small island developing state (SIDS) that has experienced
   unprecedented changes in recent decades. The focus on mobility stems
   from the fact that it forms an integral social and cultural part of
   island life. Although gender and mobility are intrinsically linked, the
   gendered consequences of adaptation for mobility are understudied. This
   study used qualitative interviews to collect narratives. The results
   show that the adaptation interviewees describe from their living memory
   has only exacerbated gender inequality by influencing the mobility of
   men and women in different ways.},

Abstract = {Resilience has become a prominent topic in the planning and design
   industry over the past several years. States, cities and entire regions
   face an ever-growing threat of environmental and societal challenges,
   including natural disasters, sea level rise, climate change, terrorism
   and financial insolvency. Around the world, universities are leading
   efforts in terms of research and problem solving regarding resilience
   and sustainability in their broader communities. As campus planners
   working nationwide with higher education clients, we see an increasing
   opportunity for higher education researchers, leaders and institutions
   to bring this same leadership stance to addressing their campus' own
   resilience. A campus master plan is perhaps the pinnacle opportunity to
   connect expert researchers with campus stewards and community leaders to
   engage in dialogue, identify priorities and advance resilience within
   their campus and community. A comprehensive master plan, by its very
   nature, will guide and protect an institution's long-range survival and
   plans. Such long-range planning is now more critical than ever given the
   deep financial pressures and flat or declining demographics that so many
   institutions face. Being proactive versus reactive increases the
   likelihood that institutions will succeed and continue to meet the needs
   of students and communities. Universities should continue or begin to
   address resilience challenges and opportunities in whatever scope
   possible. This paper will give university leaders and industry
   participants a broad framework to direct discussion and dissect levels
   of resilience, opportunities and potential shortfalls, and highlight
   resilient campus planning best practices. The aim is to provide a
   framework for institutions to measure and strengthen the resilience of
   their infrastructure, culture, and systems, while contributing to the
   resilience of their communities.},

Abstract = {Understanding the impact of weather variability on current agricultural
   production systems is of great importance for the development of
   strategies for adapting to and mitigating the potential impact of
   climate change on food security in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. This
   essay assesses the impact of short-term weather variability on rice and
   aquaculture production, documents ways in which farmers have dealt with
   weather anomalies, and suggests strategies to adapt to weather and
   climate variability in the future. Statistical series data (1990-2008)
   and information collected from previous projects were analyzed. The
   probabilities of occurrences of weather anomalies were calculated and
   multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify and estimate
   significant effects of various weather variables on yields of rice and
   fish or shrimp in both irrigated and coastal regions. The results showed
   that temperature and rainfall were the key weather variables that
   strongly influenced rice and shrimp production. Vulnerability levels to
   weather variability differed by crops, crop-development stages, cropping
   seasons, and regions. Rice production was found to be more sensitive to
   weather variability than was aquaculture, and shrimp production was more
   sensitive than was Pangasius catfish culture. The impacts became more
   severe during the early vegetative, flowering, and ripening stages of
   rice crops. The wet-season rice crop and the coastal region were more
   vulnerable to weather anomalies than the dry-season rice crop and the
   irrigated region, respectively. Local farmers have coped with
   temperature and rainfall anomalies in the past by applying appropriate
   farming techniques. Nonetheless, further measures for adapting to
   weather and climate variability are essential.},

Title = {Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analysis reveals molecular
   responses of the clams to acute hypoxia},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mudflat shellfish have evolved well-adapted strategies for coping with
   dynamic environmental fluxes and stressful conditions, including oxygen
   availability. The Manila clams Ruditapes philippinarum are worldwide
   cultured shellfish in marine intertidal zone, which usually encounter
   great risk of acute hypoxia exposure in coastal habitats. To reveal the
   effects of acute hypoxia on metabolic changes of the clams, we performed
   the integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics to
   investigate the global changes of genes and metabolites during acute
   hypoxia stress at the whole-organism level. The comparative
   transcriptome analysis reveals that the clams show the remarkable
   depression in a variety of biological performance, such as metabolic
   rates, neuronal activity, biomineralization activity, and cell
   proliferation and differentiation at the hypoxic condition. The
   metabolomic analysis reveals that amino acid metabolism plays a critical
   role in the metabolic changes of the clams in response to acute hypoxia.
   A variety of free amino acids may not only be served as the potential
   osmolytes for osmotic regulation, but also may contribute to energy
   production during the acute hypoxia exposure. The metabolite analysis
   also reveals several important biomarkers for metabolic changes, and
   provides new insights into how clams deal with acute hypoxia. These
   findings suggest that clams may get through acute hypoxia stress by the
   adaptive metabolic strategy to survive short-period of acute hypoxia
   which is likely to occur in their typical habitat. The present findings
   will not only shed lights on the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of
   adaptive strategies under stressful conditions, but also provide the
   signaling metabolites to assess the physiological states of clams in
   aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Nuisance flooding (NF) refers to low levels of inundation that do not
   pose significant threats to public safety or cause major property
   damage, but can disrupt routine day-to-day activities, put added strain
   on infrastructure systems such as roadways and sewers, and cause minor
   property damage. NF has received some attention in the context of
   low-lying coastal cities exposed to increasingly higher high tides, a
   consequence of sea level rise, which exceeds the heights of coastal
   topography. However, low levels of flooding are widespread and deserve
   greater attention. Here a simple, quantitative definition of NF is
   proposed based on established flood intensity thresholds for flood
   consequences (e.g., pedestrian safety, property damage, and health
   risks). Based on a wide range of literature including hydrology,
   transportation, public health risk, and safety impacts, we define NF
   based on depth >3 cm and <10 cm, regardless of the source. This
   definition of NF is not limited to high tide flooding but rather is
   inclusive of all possible flood drivers including pluvial, fluvial, and
   oceanic and can capture trends in NF resulting from trends in, and
   compounding effects of, flood drivers. Furthermore, we also distinguish
   between NF as a process and NF as an event, which is important for
   linking NF to societal impacts and developing effective policy
   interventions and mitigation strategies. Potential applications and
   implications of NF monitoring are also presented.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ocean provides resources key to human health and well-being,
   including food, oxygen, livelihoods, blue spaces, and medicines. The
   global threat to these resources posed by accelerating ocean
   acidification is becoming increasingly evident as the world's oceans
   absorb carbon dioxide emissions. While ocean acidification was initially
   perceived as a threat only to the marine realm, here we argue that it is
   also an emerging human health issue. Specifically, we explore how ocean
   acidification affects the quantity and quality of resources key to human
   health and well-being in the context of: (1) malnutrition and poisoning,
   (2) respiratory issues, (3) mental health impacts, and (4) development
   of medical resources. We explore mitigation and adaptation management
   strategies that can be implemented to strengthen the capacity of
   acidifying oceans to continue providing human health benefits.
   Importantly, we emphasize that the cost of such actions will be
   dependent upon the socioeconomic context; specifically, costs will
   likely be greater for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations,
   exacerbating the current inequitable distribution of environmental and
   human health challenges. Given the scale of ocean acidification impacts
   on human health and well-being, recognizing and researching these
   complexities may allow the adaptation of management such that not only
   are the harms to human health reduced but the benefits enhanced.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Using a micro-scale urban simulation program, we examined the
   sensitivity of air temperature and mean radiant temperature (MRT) of
   built-up urban cores to urban-area geometry (the density of buildings),
   thermal properties of human-made surfaces (albedo) and green cover
   (street trees), in 2 warm-climate cities: Pettah, Colombo (Sri Lanka)
   and downtown Phoenix, Arizona (USA). Air temperature and MRT are
   indicative of human thermal comfort, and their rural/urban gradients
   signify the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Although high albedo values
   lead to low daytime temperatures in both cities, the best thermal
   comfort, quantified by both the air temperature and MRT, was found in
   high-density development. Thus, density enhancement is a viable UHI
   mitigation option in built-up areas of warm climate cities. Manipulation
   of thermal properties is an alternative strategy, but the practical
   utility of high albedo surfaces is questionable. Additionally, some UHI
   mitigation options are more likely to bring improvements in MRT than in
   air temperature. Urban designers should use mitigation options that are
   based on human comfort, which is determined by both MRT and air
   temperature, rather than simply attempting to control air temperature
   alone.},

Abstract = {Infectious marine diseases can decimate populations and are increasing
   among some taxa due to global change and our increasing reliance on
   marine environments. Marine diseases become emergencies when significant
   ecological, economic or social impacts occur. We can prepare for and
   manage these emergencies through improved surveillance, and the
   development and iterative refinement of approaches to mitigate disease
   and its impacts. Improving surveillance requires fast, accurate
   diagnoses, forecasting disease risk and real-time monitoring of
   disease-promoting environmental conditions. Diversifying impact
   mitigation involves increasing host resilience to disease, reducing
   pathogen abundance and managing environmental factors that facilitate
   disease. Disease surveillance and mitigation can be adaptive if informed
   by research advances and catalysed by communication among observers,
   researchers and decision-makers using information-sharing platforms.
   Recent increases in the awareness of the threats posed by marine
   diseases may lead to policy frameworks that facilitate the responses and
   management that marine disease emergencies require.},

Title = {Sea Level Rise in Miami Beach: Vulnerability and Real Estate Exposure},
Journal = {PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {278-291},
Abstract = {Sea level rise threatens coastal communities throughout the United
   States, and South Florida is on the front line. The iconic and built-up
   city of Miami Beach, Florida, has a well-developed, high-value property
   market, and the municipality has been lauded for proactively taking
   action to adapt to anticipated sea level rise. Moving beyond hyperbole
   and piecemeal evidence, we compile a comprehensive inventory of
   adaptation and mitigation measures implemented by various municipal
   agencies. We employ these data sets to measure exposure and readiness
   for the entire city and make a preliminary effort to develop a city
   vulnerability index. Our findings reveal that exposure throughout the
   city is high and that readiness is concentrated near stormwater drainage
   systems, leading to high vulnerability along the coast. When we compare
   the spatial patterns of the vulnerability index and the residential
   property values, we find a mismatch. The most vulnerable regions are
   characterized by high income, transiency, and an apparent
   unresponsiveness to sea level rise. No doubt our findings illustrate a

Title = {Extreme sea-level rise and adaptation options for coastal resort cities:
   A qualitative assessment from the Gold Coast, Australia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Gold Coast, Australia is a coastal resort city whose urban
   environment has evolved through a series of human interventions on the
   natural shoreline. Such cities rely on a perceived high quality
   environment which in turn is reliant on continuing maintenance (e.g.
   beach nourishment, inlet dredging, drainage). Climate change
   consequently holds particular challenges for coastal resort cities.
   Sea-level rise impacts are likely to be manifest in increased frequency
   of flooding and beach erosion episodes. Here we consider adaptation
   options for the city under various future sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios
   at the high end of current predictions for the next century (+1 m, +2 m
   and +5 m) with the proviso that the beach and waterways must be
   preserved to enable the city to continue to exist as a resort.
   We conclude that pre-planned adaptation would probably enable the city
   to survive SLR of 1 m. An unplanned response to the same SLR would
   likely be characterised by periodic crises, growing uncertainty and
   public unease and would have marginal chances of success. For a 2 m SLR
   we contend that even with an adaptation plan in place, the scale of
   measures required would severely stretch the city's resources. Under a 5
   m SLR over the next century we do not believe that any amount of
   planning would enable the city to survive as a coastal resort.
   Any adaptation to SLR would involve increased cost to maintain the
   artificial coastal environment. Adaptation options are particularly
   constrained by the widespread development around the waterways of the
   back-barrier area. Unlike other coastal cities, resorts depend on a
   public perception of a high quality environment. Maintaining this
   perception under SLR imposes particular adaptation constraints on resort
   cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Disaster management and climate change adaptation: a remote island
   perspective},
Journal = {DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-137},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a perspective on
   disaster management and climate change adaptation often left out of the
   literature that of a remote outer island in Fiji.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative fieldwork was conducted on a
   small, remote island in the north of Fiji, during 2012. Interviews with
   community members on this island looked at their experiences and
   perceptions of disaster response and aid, and their expectations for the
   future. The perspectives of government and aid organisations involved in
   disaster response were compared with the remote community views.
   Findings - There is a prevalent view in Fiji of communities as having
   very high expectations of disaster relief aid, and being dependent on
   it. However, on a remote island where the community counts the wait for
   help in weeks rather than days, such expectations and dependence must be
   viewed in a different light. There is much to be learned from the
   resilience and self-help these communities have no choice but to
   exhibit.
   Originality/value - This paper helps to fill a gap in the disaster and
   climate change adaptation literature, by providing some insight into the
   experiences and perceptions of a remote outer island community, within
   the remote small island developing state of Fiji.},

Abstract = {Cost effectiveness Of CO2 sequestration, especially into aquifers,
   strongly depends on the sequestration capacities and the routes
   connecting their sites and CO2 recovery sites. This site dependency Of
   CO2 sequestration makes their evaluations difficult. In order to
   evaluate C 02 sequestration in parallel with other carbon mitigation
   options in Japan, a new model has been developed for this study.
   Explicit modeling is made for energy systems and also CO2 recoveries
   from fossil fuel power plants, CO2 transportation and sequestration
   processes. To pay due consideration to the site dependency, the land
   area of Japan is divided into 20 regions and the off-shore area also
   into 20 regions. The land regions have various types of electric power
   plants and other energy systems. On the other hand, the off-shore
   regions have aquifers for CO2 sequestration. In addition, CO2
   sequestration into the ocean is taken into account. These model regions
   are inter-linked to each other to evaluate CO2 transportation between
   the CO2 sources and the reservoirs. The total costs of energy systems
   and CO2 sequestration in Japan between the year of 2000 and 2050 is
   minimized in this model. This paper describes the structure of this new
   model for evaluation Of CO2 sequestrations in Japan, and presents
   optimized solutions as to when, where and how much CO2 sequestration and
   other carbon mitigation options should be implemented under assumed
   carbon mitigation policy options using this new model.},

Abstract = {All countries are addressing the drastic climate changes as high
   priority issues. The impact of climate change on coastal land use in
   Taiwan has been especially severe due to the country's long coastline.
   As such, developing strategies to promote the protection of coastal land
   is critical for the sustainable development of the land. At present,
   even though the central government has developed the relevant adaptation
   strategies and implementation plans in response to climate change. Due
   to the limited resources, determining which protection strategy should
   be implemented as a top priority will require a strategic evaluation for
   planning and reference purposes.
   While most of the existing literature on coastal land use has been
   focused on the establishment of a vulnerability index along with an
   analysis of adaptation strategies very little of the existing literature
   discusses research that has been conducted in relation to an in-depth
   analysis of climate change and coastal land use. Therefore, this study
   uses the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to conduct an exploration of
   coastal land use and protection strategy. The study compiled the
   literature and related data to establish five major assessment
   dimensions and 16 protection strategy evaluation indicators. After the
   empirical investigation and analysis, the findings demonstrated that the
   designation of coastal conservation areas is the most important aspect
   in terms of strategies to protect coastal land, followed by land
   subsidence control and the establishment of land disaster warning
   systems.},

Abstract = {The global human population is growing exponentially, close to a
   majority lives and works near the coast, and coastal commerce and
   development are critical to the economies of many nations. Hence,
   coastal areas will continue to be a major focus of development and
   economic activity. People desire the economic advantages provided by
   coastal development along with the fisheries and social commodities
   supported by estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Because of these facts,
   we view the challenge of balancing coastal development with enhancing
   nearshore marine and estuarine ecosystems (i.e., net ecosystem
   improvement) as the top priority for coastal researchers in this
   century. Our restoration research in Pacific Northwest estuaries and
   participation in nearshore project design and impact mitigation has
   largely dealt with these competing goals. To this end, we have applied
   conceptual models, comprehensive assessment methods, and principles of
   restoration ecology, conservation biology, and adaptive management to
   incorporate science into decisions about uses of estuarine systems. Case
   studies of Bainbridge Island and the Columbia River demonstrate the use
   of objective, defensible methods to prioritize tidally influenced
   shorelines and habitats (i.e., riparian forests, marshes, unvegetated
   flats, rocky shores, seagrass meadows, kelp forests) for preservation,
   conservation, and restoration. Case studies of Clinton, Washington, and
   Port Townsend, Washington, demonstrate the incorporation of an
   ecological perspective and technological solutions into design of
   overwater structures to minimize impacts on nearshore ecosystems.
   Adaptive management has allowed coastal development and restoration
   uncertainties to be better evaluated, with the information used to
   improve management decisions. Although unproven on a large scale, we
   think these kinds of methods can contribute to the net improvement of
   already degraded ecosystems. The ingredients include applied science to
   understand the issues, education, incentives, empirical data, cumulative
   impact analysis, and an effective adaptive management program. Because
   the option of net ecosystem improvement is often more costly than
   alternatives such as no net loss, commitment by the local or regional
   community to this approach is essential.},

Abstract = {We discuss a strategy for investigating the impacts of climate change on
   Earth's physical, biological and human resources and links to their
   socio-economic consequences. As examples, we consider effects on
   agriculture and human health. Progress requires a careful understanding
   of the chain of physical changes-global and regional temperature,
   precipitation, ocean acidification, polar ice melting. We relate those
   changes to other physical and biological variables that help people
   understand risks to factors relevant to their daily lives-crop yield,
   food prices, premature death, flooding or drought events, land use
   change. Finally, we investigate how societies may adapt, or not, to
   these changes and how the combination of measures to adapt or to live
   with losses will affect the economy. Valuation and assessment of market
   impacts can play an important role, but we must recognize the limits of
   efforts to value impacts where deep uncertainty does not allow a
   description of the causal chain of effects that can be described, much
   less assigned a likelihood. A mixed approach of valuing impacts,
   evaluating physical and biological effects, and working to better
   describe uncertainties in the earth system can contribute to the social
   dialogue needed to achieve consensus on the level and type of mitigation
   and adaptation actions.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic transformed social and economic systems globally,
   including fisheries systems. Decreases in seafood demand, supply chain
   disruptions, and public safety regulations required numerous adaptations
   to maintain the livelihoods and social resilience of fishing
   communities. Surveys, interviews, and focus groups were undertaken to
   assess impacts from and adaptive responses to the pandemic in commercial
   fisheries in five U.S. regions: the Northeast, California, Alaska, the
   U.S. Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Fishery adaptation strategies
   were categorized using the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework, a novel
   application to understand social transformation in a social-ecological
   system in response to a disturbance. A number of innovations emerged, or
   were facilitated, that could improve the fisheries' resilience to future
   disruptions. Fishers with diversified options and strategic flexibility
   generally fared better, i.e., had fewer disruptions to their
   livelihoods. Using the RAD framework to identify adaptation strategies
   from fishery system actors highlights opportunities for improving
   resilience of fisheries social-ecological systems to future stressors.},

Journal = {ONE EARTH},

Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-211},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Blue carbon provides opportunities to mitigate climate change while
   increasing ecosystem services for coastal communities, including climate
   change adaptation; however, blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to
   climate change, leading to uncertainties in the future efficacy of these
   ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate
   change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in
   coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon
   habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved
   water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could
   result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed
   beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change
   mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full
   potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of
   ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with
   climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits.
   Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg
   of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the rate of coastal erosion at several beaches on
   the island of Trinidad in the Southern Caribbean. Erosion rates are
   gauged from analyses of sequential beach profiles spanning the period
   1990 to 2001, for most beaches. Based on data collected and
   differentiated according to season, average erosion rates are about 1 to
   2 metres per year. However, for a single year extreme erosion rates
   approaching 10 to 12 metres have been noted, although these abnormal
   rates have been followed by accretion. Our data also show evidence of
   accelerated erosion, most likely linked to unduly high rates of relative
   sea level rise. Adaptation measures to cope with unduly high rates of
   coastal erosion include sea defences, limited by cost considerations,
   and retreat, which given limited land area, is not desirable.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1529-1541},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A web-based software tool has been developed to assist urban planners
   and air quality management officials in assessing the potential of urban
   heat island mitigation strategies to affect the urban climate, air
   quality, and energy consumption within their cities. The user of the
   tool can select from over 170 US cities for which to conduct the
   analysis, and can specify city-wide changes in surface reflectivity
   and/or vegetative cover. The Mitigation Impact Screening Tool (MIST)
   then extrapolates results from a suite of simulations for 20 cities to
   estimate air temperature changes associated with the specified changes
   in surface characteristics for the selected city. Alternatively the user
   can simply define a nominal air temperature reduction that they hope to
   achieve with an unspecified mitigation scenario. These air temperature
   changes are then input to energy and ozone models to estimate the impact
   that the mitigation action may have on the selected city. The results
   presented by MIST include a high degree of uncertainty and are intended
   only as a first-order estimate that urban planners can use to assess the
   viability of heat island mitigation strategies for their cities. As
   appropriate, MIST analyses should be supplemented by more detailed
   modeling. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Voluntary resilience standards are an emerging tool for cities to
   incentivize developers to incorporate climate change adaptation
   strategies. Urban planners and researchers, however, are still assessing
   their relative impacts on the design of recent large-scale development
   projects. This paper answers the question of whether, and at what scale,
   anticipated changes to mapped flood risk are associated with mitigation
   actions to accommodate climate change. A case study of the Climate
   Change Preparedness and Resiliency Checklist in Boston, Massachusetts
   presents a database of 171 unique survey responses from 104 proposed
   projects. Comparing developments with documentation to an internal
   subset of 54 projects in the Boston Planning and Development Agency's
   projected Sea Level Rise - Flood Hazard Area (SLR-FHA), this paper finds
   projects impacted by updated Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
   Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are associated with different building
   uses, higher sea level rise assumptions and greater abilities to endure
   inundation. There are also neighbourhood-level differences in climate
   expertise and the projects' ability to withstand utility disruption.
   Both of these observed impacts may have important implications for the
   formulation and application of voluntary resilience standards in other
   coastal cities.},

   protected areas of western North America},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Protected areas are a fundamental component of many conservation
   strategies. They safeguard some of the best examples of unfragmented
   natural landscapes in many regions, provide important habitat for rare
   and threatened species, and serve as a refuge from a human-dominated
   world. As climates continue to change, species distributions, ecological
   communities, and ecosystems will be altered. An understanding of the
   trends in these changes can allow protected area managers to develop
   more effective climate-adaptation strategies. Here, we quantify the
   relative amount of projected potential climate-driven ecological change
   across a protected area network by calculating three metrics. We
   assessed future projected changes in temperature and precipitation,
   shifts in major vegetation types, and vertebrate species turnover for
   the protected areas of the Pacific Northwestern region of North America.
   In general, the degree of projected change in the three metrics followed
   a longitudinal gradient from the Pacific coast inland toward the
   continental interior. Protected areas expected to experience the least
   change are at low elevations near the coast and throughout the Coastal
   Mountains, whereas areas expected to experience the most change are
   found at higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin
   regions. The resulting spatial variation in these impact measures
   underscores the importance of developing appropriate, location-specific,
   climate-adaptation strategies in response to disparate trends in future
   environmental change.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to assess the vulnerability to climate change of
   human communities in selected mouzas of Sagar Island, South 24 Parganas
   District of India. A primary household survey has been conducted to
   collect data on socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategy, health,
   food, water, social network, natural disaster and climate variation
   indicators, were selected for Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and
   Livelihood Vulnerability Index-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (LVI-IPCC) analyses to measure and compare the vulnerability of mouzas
   (administrative unit) currently suffering from frequent flooding,
   coastal erosion and embankment breaching on an annual basis. Secondary
   data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department, the Water
   Resources Information System of India and the Global Sea Level Observing
   System have been used to identify dynamics of climate change by
   employing statistical and Geographic Information System (GIS)
   techniques. A GPS survey has been conducted to identify locations of
   embankment breaching, and satellite images obtained from the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Geological Survey (NASA
   USGS) Government website have been applied to shoreline and land use
   change detection, using a supervised maximum likelihood classification.
   The results indicate that the study area has experienced increasing
   temperature, changing precipitation patterns, rise in sea level, higher
   storm surges, shoreline change, constant land loss, embankment breaching
   and changing land use, which have had impact on vulnerability,
   particularly of poorer people. The LVI (0.48 to 0.68) and LVI-IPCC (0.04
   to 0.14) scores suggest that the populations of Dhablat, Bankimnagar,
   Sumatinagar, Muri Ganga and Sibpur mouzas are highly vulnerable (LVI
   scores of 0.60 to 0.68 and LVI-IPCC scores of 0.11 to 0.14) to climate
   change both because the communities are more exposed to it, and because
   poor access to food, health facilities and water makes them extremely
   sensitive to it and lowers their adaptive capacity. The findings of this
   study could be crucial to framing further development and adaptation
   strategies relating to climate change, and to safeguarding the estuarine
   ecosystem and the vulnerable population.},

Title = {The disaster resilience assessment of coastal areas: A method for
   improving the stakeholders' participation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {214},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Increasing frequency, intensity and severity of natural hazards
   associated to climate change are among the pressing challenges the world
   is facing requiring greater resilience for communities. This challenge
   calls for new policies and actions at regional and local level having
   the concept of resilience as their main driver and core component.
   However in order to prioriotirise and invest in the resilience building,
   the actors involved in the governance of a territory and in the
   implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction measures must first recognize
   the multifacted nature of resilience and the importance of its
   measurement. Priorities, resilience meaning and metrics are subject to
   different interpretations, making resilience a societal complex issue.
   To this end the paper aims to provide a new method for the incorporation
   of multilevel stakeholders' view in the assessment of the inherent
   resilience of a place and in the design of a metric based Resilience
   Index (RI). The new approach integrates the Disaster Resilience of Place
   (DROP) model and the use of semi-structured interviews with a standpoint
   in the Grounded Theory Methodology to facilitate both the assessment of
   resilience in a quantitative manner and an in-depth analysis of the
   context. The method has been applied in the framework of coastal
   exposure to flood, by involving 18 municipalites of the Po River Delta
   (Italy). The interactions of the, physical and anthropogenic processes

Abstract = {In fisheries management, social and institutional sustainability factors
   have proven difficult to incorporate into planning and are often traded
   off in support of ecological and economic factors. Thus, there has been
   little support for institutional innovation such as adaptive
   co-management. The literature on legal pluralism indicates one
   constraint on innovative institutions. In response, Bavinck and Gupta
   suggest `institutional bricolage' to bridge underlying value
   differences. However, value conflicts may prevent institutions from

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Current studies of the impact of climate change mitigation options tend
   to scale patterns of precipitation change linearly with surface
   temperature. Using climate model simulations, we show a nonlinear
   hydrological response to transient global warming and a substantial side
   effect of climate mitigation. In an idealised representation of
   mitigation action, where we reverse the trend of global warming, the
   precipitation response shows significant hysteresis behaviour due to
   heat previously accumulated in the ocean. Stabilising or reducing CO2
   concentrations in the atmosphere is found temporarily to strengthen the
   global hydrological cycle, while reducing rainfall over some tropical
   and subtropical regions. The drying trend under global warming over The
   Amazon, Australia and western Africa may intensify for decades after CO2
   reductions. The inertia due to accumulated heat in the ocean implies a
   commitment to hydrological cycle changes long after stabilisation or
   reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Citation: Wu, P., R. Wood,

Title = {Identifying global and local drivers of change in mangrove cover and the

Abstract = {Background Climate change and human activities continue to drive a
   widespread decline in global mangrove coverage, undermining their
   capacity to provide ecosystem benefits. While global and local scale
   drivers of change on mangroves are widely acknowledged, the relative
   importance and the exposure of mangroves to climatic, geomorphological,
   and direct human threats vary spatially. Understanding the role and
   relative importance of the multiscale and multiple threats to mangroves
   and how these vary spatially is fundamental for formulating a spatially
   adaptive approach to their management and conservation. Aim Our study
   investigated the role of multiple threats on mangroves and the relative
   exposure. Location Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region. Time period Recent
   past (2002-2019 and future (2050-2060). Major taxa studied Mangrove.
   Methods Using satellite-derived indicators of mangrove condition
   aggregated over 19 years (2002 to 2019) and 14 proxies of climate, human
   activity, and geomorphology, we applied machine learning methods to
   determine the role and relative importance of the change drivers. Using
   outputs from this deductive statistical process, we applied inductive
   methods to map mangrove exposure spatially. Results Model results
   highlight the importance of catchment erosion, human pressure, sea
   level, and macroclimate as the main drivers of the present-day
   ecological condition of mangroves in the WIO. Normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) was more sensitive to the identified drivers
   than the vegetation condition index (VCI), with the relative importance
   of variables varying across the two vegetation indicators. Main
   conclusions In anticipation of a stronger manifestation of climate
   change impacts, the resilience of mangroves in the WIO could be improved
   through adaptive management over time and space. Testing the efficacy of
   the essential biodiversity variables (EBV) is critical for understanding
   the mechanisms of ecosystem change and managing biodiversity change.},

Abstract = {Climate change is currently one of the key environmental, social,
   economic and political problems in numerous countries. The effects of
   this change, occurring over the last few decades, intensify, and
   therefore have become an object of interest to governments, the
   international community, and science. Results of scientific research
   indicate that the consequences of climate change pose a threat to the
   social and economic development of many countries worldwide. The current
   situation in the world would not have been so dramatic if it had not
   been for the fact that the trend in climate change has already brought
   about a significant and noticeable effect on numerous physical and
   biological systems (water, the environment, health). Over the last
   decades, scientists also noted an increase in the number of natural
   disasters caused by the climate change. The consequences of climate
   change and the emergence of extreme weather events always affect the
   most sensitive areas. According to the National Adaptation Strategy for
   Poland, sensitive areas include coastal and mountainous zones,
   agricultural land, areas of high biological diversity, and residential
   areas. The production carried out in agricultural land is subject to
   natural weather conditions, which means that agricultural producers, due
   to the climate change taking place, are at increasing risk contributing
   to the reduction in the future income because of the occurring financial
   losses, soil erosion, or a low quality of grazing land, which translates
   into a reduction in investment in the means of production and the
   development of modern technologies in the agricultural farm. One of the
   latest reports Food and Agrieztlture Organization of the United Nations
   indicates a wide range of adaptation and mitigation measures which an
   agricultural producer may implement in their farm in order to minimize
   the consequences of ongoing climate change.
   The variability of weather in areas used for agriculture has always
   performed. The study aimed at a deeper understanding of the evolution of
   hedging activities by the variability of weather and finding the roots
   of the emergence of adaptive models. To achieve this purpose a survey
   (in-depth interview), which allowed to know what range of actions to
   prevent fmancial losses, farmers use in the site. The results indicate
   that farmers are not always aware that the actions taken in farms are
   the result passed intergenerational patterns of preventing financial
   losses. The results of the survey showed that often certain actions
   performed by the farmers are duplicated because ``my father did that and
   it was good, so I will not change anything.{''} This attitude of farmers
   is the difficulty in changing the approach for the proposed new
   solutions. On the other hand, if a solution to effectively protect
   against financial loss should such information to propagate between the
   local community of farmers.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Rapid changes in global climate are likely to alter species assemblages
   and environmental characteristics resulting in novel ecosystems. The
   ability to predict characteristics of future ecosystems is crucial for
   environmental planning and the development of effective climate change
   adaptation strategies. This paper presents an approach for envisioning
   novel ecosystems in future climates. Focusing on riparian ecosystems, we
   use qualitative process models to predict likely abiotic and biotic
   changes in four case study systems: tropical coastal floodplains,
   temperate streams, high mountain streams and urban riparian zones. We
   concentrate on functional groups rather than individual species and
   consider dispersal constraints and the capacity for genetic adaptation.
   Our scenarios suggest that climatic changes will reduce indigenous
   diversity, facilitate non-indigenous invasion (especially C4
   graminoids), increase fragmentation and result in simplified and less
   distinctive riparian ecosystems. Compared to models based on
   biota-environment correlations, process models built on mechanistic
   understanding (like Bayesian belief networks) are more likely to remain
   valid under novel climatic conditions. We posit that predictions based
   on species' functional traits will facilitate regional comparisons and
   can highlight effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and
   function. Ecosystems that have experienced similar modification to that
   expected under climate change (for example, altered flow regimes of
   regulated rivers) can be used to help inform and evaluate predictions.
   By manipulating attributes of these system models (for example,
   magnitude of climatic changes or adaptation strategies used),
   implications of various scenarios can be assessed and optimal management
   strategies identified.},

Abstract = {Wavefront distortions of optical waves propagating through the turbulent
   atmosphere are responsible for phase and amplitude fluctuations, causing
   random fading in the signal coupled into single-mode optical fibers.
   Wavefront aberrations can be confronted, in principle, with adaptive
   optics technology that compensates the incoming optical signal by the
   phase conjugation principle and mitigates the likeliness of fading.
   However, real-time adaptive optics requires phase wavefront
   measurements, which are generally difficult under typical propagation
   conditions for communication scenarios. As an alternative to the
   conventional adaptive optics approach, here, we discuss a novel
   phase-retrieval technique that indirectly determines the unknown phase
   wavefront from focal-plane intensity measurements. The adaptation
   approach is based on sequential optimization of the speckle pattern in
   the focal plane and works by iteratively updating the phases of
   individual speckles to maximize the received power. We found in our
   analysis that this technique can compensate the distorted phasefront and
   increase the signal coupled with a significant reduction in the required
   number of iterations, resulting in a loop bandwidth utilization well
   within the capacity of commercially available deformable mirrors. (C)

Title = {An assessment of structural measures for risk reduction of
   hydrometeorological disasters in Sri Lanka},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sri Lanka has a high incidence of natural hazards with
   hydrometeorological hazards being the most prevalent. Despite the fact
   that structural measures such as flood walls and embankments play a
   vital role in disaster mitigation, it is observed that there is a gap in
   the development of effective, sustainable, and state of the art
   structural measures in Sri Lanka. This paper, in this context, aims to
   assess the nature of existing structural measures in the country in
   order to highlight what improvements are needed, and the costs and
   benefits of the necessary improvements. This is achieved through a
   comprehensive literature review followed by the analysis of twelve
   semi-structured interviews conducted with experts in the subject of
   structural measures for disaster mitigation. The findings reveal that
   Sri Lanka has sufficient types of structural measures in relation to
   floods, landslides, and coastline erosion compared to other developing
   countries. However, age and outdated technology are critical issues that
   hinder the expected performance of the measures. Moreover, it is
   observed that sufficient structural measures for mitigating the risk of
   drought related disasters are not in place in Sri Lanka compared to
   measures for other hydrometeorological hazards. The key benefits of
   improving structural measures in the country are identified as land
   development, economic growth, and increased stability of cities, and the
   main costs and challenges are high initial capital cost, high
   maintenance and repair cost, and the negligible residual value of
   structural measures. The findings of this study will lead to gaining a
   comprehensive understanding of gaps and weaknesses in structural
   measures in Sri Lanka and will influence policymakers and other
   respective practitioners in disaster mitigation to effectively enhance
   the existing portfolio of such measures.},

Title = {Residential flood vulnerability along the developed North Carolina, USA
   coast: High resolution social and physical data for decision support},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article presents an ArcGIS geodatabase of socio-demographic and
   physical characteristics derived from recent high resolution data
   sources to construct measures of population vulnerability to inundation
   in the 28 counties of coastal North Carolina, U.S.A. as presented in
   Pricope et al., 2019. The region is simultaneously densely populated,
   low-lying and exposed to recurrent inundation related to storms and
   incremental sea level rise. The data presented here can be used as a
   decision support tool in coastal planning, emergency management
   preparedness, designing adaptation strategies and developing strategies
   for coastal resilience. The socio-demographic data (population and
   housing) was derived from 228 tables at the block-group level of
   geography from the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau. These data were
   statistically analyzed, using Principal Component Analysis, to identify
   key factors and then used to construct a Social Vulnerability Index
   (SOVI) at the block-group level of geography which highlighted regions
   where socio-demographic characteristics such as family structure, race,
   housing (primarily owner vs. renter-occupied), special needs populations
   (e.g. elderly and group living), and household/family size play an
   overwhelmingly important role in determining community vulnerability
   from a social perspective. An index of physical exposure was developed
   using the National Flood Hazards Maps (available from North Carolina's
   Flood Risk Information System and FEMA) along with a novel building
   inventory dataset available from the North Carolina Department of Public
   Safety that contains the Finished-Floor Elevation of every structure in
   the state. We took advantage of the unprecedented high spatial
   resolution nature of the building inventory dataset to calculate an
   index of physical vulnerability to inundation of every block group in
   the 28 coastal counties relative to Base Flood elevations and identified
   hotspots where this intersection predisposes people to an increased risk
   of flooding. Here, we present the final derived dataset containing the
   social, physical and an integrative measure of vulnerability to flooding
   that can be used at multiple scales of analysis, starting with the
   regional, county, local, and neighborhood to identify areas of priority
   intervention for risk-reduction in coastal planning and emergency
   management preparedness as well as forward-looking adaptation
   strategies. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Resistance, resilience, and recovery of salt marshes in the Florida
   Panhandle following Hurricane Michael},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Characterizing the fragility, resistance, and resilience of marshes is
   critical for understanding their role in reducing storm damages and for
   helping to manage the recovery of these natural defenses. This study
   uses high-resolution aerial imagery to quantify the impacts of Hurricane
   Michael, a category 5 hurricane, on coastal salt marshes in the Florida
   Panhandle, USA. Marsh damage was classified into several categories,
   including deposition of sediment or wrack, fallen trees, vegetation
   loss, and conversion to open water. The marshes were highly resistant to
   storm damages even under extreme conditions; only 2\% of the 173,259
   km(2) of marshes in the study area were damaged-a failure rate much
   lower than that of artificial defenses. Marshes may be more resistant
   than resilient to storm impacts; damaged marshes were slow to recover,
   and only 16\% of damaged marshes had recovered 6 months after landfall.
   Marsh management mattered for resistance and resilience; marshes on
   publicly-managed lands were less likely to be damaged and more likely to
   recover quickly from storm impacts than marshes on private land,
   emphasizing the need to incentivize marsh management on private lands.
   These results directly inform policy and practice for hazard mitigation,
   disaster recovery, adaptation, and conservation, particularly given the
   potential for more intense hurricane landfalls as the climate changes.},

Title = {The administrator?s dilemma: Closing the gap between climate adaptation
   justice in theory and practice},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {280-289},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Justice theory is intended to guide practical choices, but justice
   theories struggle to inform many decisions that must be made in climate
   change adaptation practice. This paper highlights gaps between theory
   and practice by analyzing the justice dimensions of dilemmas routinely
   faced by adaptation administrators, using the example of property
   acquisitions to ground the analysis. Justice theories struggle to assist
   decision-makers in: prioritizing distribution of resources; distributing
   programs that cause both harms and benefits; weighing uncertain harms
   and benefits; identifying participants and resolving conflicts in
   participatory processes; and redressing historic injustices. Proposals
   to improve adaptation justice that do not address one or more of the
   practical dilemmas faced by administrators are unlikely to advance the
   cause. Absent theoretical or policy guidance, decisions are often shaped
   by administrators' unconscious heuristics such as views on the role of
   government and the purpose of buyouts. Tailoring justice-relevant
   decisions to local contexts may provide greater benefits than a
   universal approach to justice, but a relative approach is most likely to
   be just when justice-relevant decisions are transparent and informed by
   theoretical and empirical work. Transparency is critical for
   accountability, evaluation, and policy learning. Justice decisions are
   often constrained by limited authority, resources, and institutional
   goals, so achieving greater justice in climate adaptation may require
   changes in the larger governance systems within which adaptation
   decisions are made. More nuanced evaluations of adaptation justice, more
   comparative analyses, enabled by greater transparency in practice, and
   more holistic approaches to adaptation governance are recommended moving
   forward.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},

Abstract = {Salt intrusion in surface waters endangers freshwater availability,
   influences water quality, and affects estuarine ecosystem services with
   high economic and social values. Salt transport and the resulting
   salinity distributions result from the non-linear interactions between
   salt and water dynamics. Estuaries are often considered under
   (quasi)-steady assumption or by focusing on specific timescales. Our
   understanding of their temporal multiscale response to transient forcing
   is limited, which hinders the implementation of effective mitigation
   strategies. We apply wavelet analyses to quantify the variability of
   salt intrusion from hourly to seasonal timescales and unravel the
   temporal variability of its response across scales. We focus on an
   estuary that undergoes significant transient forcing, the Modaomen
   estuary in the Pearl River Delta, and apply the wavelet analyses to
   year-long data generated by a coastal ocean numerical model. Our results
   show that this estuary responds to changes in tidal and riverine forcing
   throughout the year over interwoven timescales. Our results highlight
   the temporal variability of the salt intrusion response time both within
   a given regime and for the transition between regimes. They also suggest
   that tides control the response time more strongly than river discharge,
   even though river discharge determines the magnitude of the salt
   intrusion, and thus modulates the evolution of the salt intrusion
   response time. We propose a broadly applicable framework to calculate
   response times with simple data. These results can provide a first-order
   guidance for design and implementation of estuarine management
   strategies and mitigation measures that ensure water access and
   facilitate sustainable development.},

Abstract = {There is now a growing literature emphasizing the critical importance of
   social variables in the formulation of coastal management policies
   seeking to tackle climate change impacts. This paper focuses on the role
   of social capital, which is increasingly identified as having a
   significant role in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.
   We focus on public perceptions of the social costs and benefits arising
   from two management options (managed retreat/realignment and
   hold-the-line), the resulting level of policy acceptability, and how
   this acceptability is mediated by social capital parameters within
   coastal communities. These issues are examined by means of a
   quantitative social survey implemented in Romney Marsh (east
   Sussex/Kent, UK), an area facing significant impacts from climate
   change. We tested two models through path analysis with latent
   structures. The first correlates respondents' perceived costs and
   benefits with the level of public acceptability of the two policy
   options. In the second model, we introduce social capital variables,
   investigating the impacts on perceived social costs and benefits of the
   policy options, and the overall effect on the level of public
   acceptability. Our findings demonstrate: (1) perceived social costs and
   benefits of proposed policy options influence the level of public
   acceptability of these policies; (2) these social costs and benefits are
   connected with the level of public acceptability; and (3) specific
   social capital parameters (i.e. social trust, institutional trust,
   social networks and social reciprocity) influence perceived policy costs
   and benefits, and also have a significant impact on the level of public
   acceptability of proposed policy options.},

Abstract = {Oceanic people and places are increasingly labelled as either
   `resilient' or `vulnerable' to disasters and climate change. Resilience
   is often described in disaster discourse as a strategy designed to
   overcome vulnerability by helping communities to `bounce back' in the
   wake of `natural' disasters. Using ethnographic research conducted with
   Community Disaster and Climate Change Committees (CDCs) in Vanuatu in
   the wake of Tropical Cyclone Pam, this paper seeks to problematise
   disaster responses that see the `community' as a space to be acted upon
   by outsiders, or where people will respond in a unified way to the
   challenges of rebuilding after disaster. Using political ecology
   framings this paper critiques the ideas of resilience that appear
   entrenched in community-based disaster and climate change adaptation
   discourse and practice in Oceania. Rather than presupposing resilience
   or vulnerability, this paper details the dispersal and distribution
   power and agency amongst individual actors and groups that either
   supported or manipulated, the distribution of goods by Community
   Disaster Committees. In this way, it moves beyond the limitations of
   conceptual framings of resilience in disaster management and climate
   change into a more considered appraisal of power, by exploring what
   James Ferguson has termed `the politics of distribution' in the context
   of disaster.},

Title = {Benefit-Cost Analysis on Coastal Structures Design for Climate Change
   Adaptation in Hong Kong},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Some experts believe that Hong Kong will probably be subjected to more
   extreme weather conditions due to climate change. To better understand
   the potential implications of the effects of climate change on coastal
   structures in Hong Kong and to ascertain necessary revisions to the
   current design standards to minimize the risk of coastal flooding, the
   Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) of the Hong Kong
   Special Administrative Region Government conducted a study to review the
   climate change situation in Hong Kong and its implications to coastal
   structures design. Projection method has been developed to project the
   two major climate change factors pertinent to design of coastal
   structures, i.e. the mean sea levels (MSLs) and extreme wind speeds, to
   different time windows of the 21st century based on IPCC AR5 scenarios.
   CEDD seriously considered investing in the future coastal structures by
   designing the new structures with climate change revisions as one of the
   adaptation measures against the climate change impact and undertook
   benefit-cost assessment to evaluate whether the adaptation measure is
   effective in coastal structures design. Three types of common coastal
   structures to cope with climate impact, i.e. sloping rock armor seawall,
   vertical block work seawall and piled-deck pier, were investigated. The
   cost-benefit analysis results demonstrated that the benefits of
   increased protection on new coastal structures to cope with climate
   change effects outweigh the additional costs incurred to construct and
   maintain these structures.},

Title = {Biofouling Mitigation Approaches during Water Recovery from Fermented
   Broth via Forward Osmosis},
Journal = {MEMBRANES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Forward Osmosis (FO) is a promising technology that can offer
   sustainable solutions in the biorefinery wastewater and desalination
   fields, via low energy water recovery. However, microbial biomass and
   organic matter accumulation on membrane surfaces can hinder the water
   recovery and potentially lead to total membrane blockage. Biofouling
   development is a rather complex process and can be affected by several
   factors such as nutrient availability, chemical composition of the
   solutions, and hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore, operational
   parameters like cross-flow velocity and pH of the filtration solution
   have been proposed as effective biofouling mitigation strategies.
   Nevertheless, most of the studies have been conducted with the use of
   rather simple solutions. As a result, biofouling mitigation practices
   based on such studies might not be as effective when applying complex
   industrial mixtures. In the present study, the effect of cross-flow
   velocity, pH, and cell concentration of the feed solution was
   investigated, with the use of complex solutions during FO separation.
   Specifically, fermentation effluent and crude glycerol were used as a
   feed and draw solution, respectively, with the purpose of recirculating
   water by using FO alone. The effect of the abovementioned parameters on
   (i) ATP accumulation, (ii) organic foulant deposition, (iii) total water
   recovery, (iv) reverse glycerol flux, and (v) process butanol rejection
   has been studied. The main findings of the present study suggest that
   significant reduction of biofouling can be achieved as a combined effect
   of high-cross flow velocity and low feed solution pH. Furthermore, cell
   removal from the feed solution prior filtration may further assist the
   reduction of membrane blockage. These results may shed light on the
   challenging, but promising field of FO process dealing with complex
   industrial solutions.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are in dire need of effective governance, yet the science
   and planning of coral reef protected areas largely stem from wealthy,
   developed nations, with very different social, economic, and cultural
   characteristics than the nations in which most coral reefs occur. Much
   has been written about coral reefs and the use of marine protected areas
   (MPAs) as a management tool, but emerging trends and recommendations
   have not been adequately synthesized for the context of developing
   nations. We found that 60\% of studies on MPA design and planning are
   from North America, Australia, Europe and the Mediterranean. As a
   result, many recommendations about how best to design, implement and
   manage coral reef protected areas may need to be adapted to address the
   needs of other nations. Based on the literature and our experiences, we
   review three emerging trends in MPA design and management, and relate
   these to the context of coral reef developing nations. First, MPA design
   is evolving to merge community (usually bottom-up) and regional (usually
   top-down) planning approaches. Second, the increasing recognition that
   social and ecological systems are tightly coupled is leading to planning
   and management of MPAs that better incorporate the human dimensions of
   reef systems and their linkages with reef ecology. Finally, there has
   been a trend toward adaptive management of MPAs and the emergence of
   related ideas about adaptive planning. These three trends provide
   crucial and much needed opportunities for improving MPAs and their
   effectiveness in coral reef nations. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published

Title = {Interventions to help coral reefs under global change-A complex decision
   challenge},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {Climate change is impacting coral reefs now. Recent pan-tropical
   bleaching events driven by unprecedented global heat waves have shifted
   the playing field for coral reef management and policy. While
   best-practice conventional management remains essential, it may no
   longer be enough to sustain coral reefs under continued climate change.
   Nor will climate change mitigation be sufficient on its own. Committed
   warming and projected reef decline means solutions must involve a
   portfolio of mitigation, best-practice conventional management and
   coordinated restoration and adaptation measures involving new and
   perhaps radical interventions, including local and regional cooling and
   shading, assisted coral evolution, assisted gene flow, and measures to
   support and enhance coral recruitment. We propose that proactive
   research and development to expand the reef management toolbox fast but
   safely, combined with expedient trialling of promising interventions is
   now urgently needed, whatever emissions trajectory the world follows. We
   discuss the challenges and opportunities of embracing new interventions
   in a race against time, including their risks and uncertainties.
   Ultimately, solutions to the climate challenge for coral reefs will
   require consideration of what society wants, what can be achieved
   technically and economically, and what opportunities we have for action
   in a rapidly closing window. Finding solutions that work for coral reefs
   and people will require exceptional levels of coordination of science,
   management and policy, and open engagement with society. It will also
   require compromise, because reefs will change under climate change
   despite our best interventions. We argue that being clear about
   society's priorities, and understanding both the opportunities and risks
   that come with an expanded toolset, can help us make the most of a
   challenging situation. We offer a conceptual model to help reef managers
   frame decision problems and objectives, and to guide effective strategy
   choices in the face of complexity and uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The mullet fishery system encompasses a complex arrange of ecological
   and socioeconomic factors interacting in multiple scales on the
   Southern-Southeastern Brazilian coast. Similarly, to other fisheries in
   developing countries, overfishing and poor governance have been
   threatening the resilience of the mullet fishery. In this paper, we
   explore aspects related to fisheries management from the perspective of
   the concept of resilience. The industrial and artisanal fishery sectors
   represent the different stakeholders. The main issues of concern are
   related to failures in the fisheries management to properly address
   equity in resource access and resource use sustainability among
   stakeholders. Asymmetry in technology and political and economic power
   affect food security and income generation especially for subsistence
   and small-scale fishing. Despite changes in rules-in-use, overfishing
   and conflicts between resource users are still relevant. Fishery
   dynamics and resource availability are greatly affected locally by
   forces such as pollution, urbanization, non-selective fishing, and
   regionally, by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and industrial
   (purse-seine) fishery. Considering the influence of ENSO on this
   fishery, a time span of at least 7 years to investigate this system
   could provide better answers to improve the management. Effective
   resilient fisheries should rely on three aspects. First, there should be
   a flexible fish allocation system based on ecosystem variability.
   Secondly, fish allocation should prioritize food security and poverty
   alleviation. Thirdly, a monitoring system should be implemented that
   takes into consideration ecosystem, fisheries and human dimensions to
   support a flexible and adaptive fisheries management, with resilient
   fisheries as an ultimate goal.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a narrative review of primary research on the
   health impacts of extreme weather events in urban informal settlements
   published between 1990 and June 2021. We include 54 studies and examine
   the health impacts of extreme weather events and how these were
   determined. We find that these events impact health directly by causing
   mortality, injury and disease and through indirect pathways by impacting
   livelihoods, access to healthcare, coping strategies and adaptive
   capacity. Drawing on the social determinants of health framework to
   frame our analysis, we find that health impacts are determined by
   multiple intersecting factors, relating to individual circumstances,
   material conditions, health status, and political and socio-economic
   context. Consequently, vulnerability varies between and within informal
   settlements. Overall, we show that responding to and minimising these
   health impacts requires an intersectional approach to understand and
   address these contextual root causes of vulnerability.},

Title = {The Adaptation Behaviour of Marine Fishermen towards Climate Change and

   Health Belief Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Key food production sectors, such as fisheries, are predicted to be
   severely impacted by climate change, which threatens food security.
   Owing to the direct influence of climate change on the lives and means
   of livelihood of marine fishing communities, effective adaptation
   methods are required to ensure the well-being of coastal communities.
   Thus, the goal of this study is to examine the various factors that
   impact the adaptation behaviour of marine fishermen towards climate
   change. To this end, data were collected from 312 Bangladeshi fishermen
   using survey questionnaires and subsequently analysed by employing
   partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Our
   findings reveal a significant and positive association between all
   components (perceived severity, perceived benefit and perceived barrier)
   of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and marine fishermen's adaptation
   behaviour. However, the perceived susceptibility component of the HBM
   had no effect on the climate change adaption behaviour of marine
   fishermen. Likewise, the findings indicate that awareness influences
   attitude, which in turn impacts the adaption behaviour of marine
   fishermen. Furthermore, the study results establish the indirect
   mediating role of awareness and attitude with respect to the adaptation
   behaviour of marine fishers. The findings of this study can be adopted
   by policymakers to develop adaptation strategies to aid marine fishermen
   in adapting to climatic effects. Furthermore, the various responses of
   marine fishermen to climate change will also serve as a useful source of
   information for the government. In summary, the information generated
   from this research can serve as a practical basis to foster adaptation
   behaviour among marine fishers and advance adaptation policies at the
   national level, not only in Bangladesh but also for other coastal
   communities that are at risk as a result of climate change.},

Abstract = {Five decades after the United Nation's first conference on the
   environment in 1972, the IPCC warned that `any further delay in
   concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will
   miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a
   liveable and sustainable future for all'. Faced with steeply rising
   greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating biodiversity loss and continued
   degradation of oceans, forests and soil, the situation appears
   increasingly baffling. Why do we not see effective measures to turn
   these developments around? As the situation grows dire, it becomes more
   mysterious: what exactly is this crisis and why has it proven so
   difficult to solve? If the problem persists, is it because it is not
   properly understood? Yet, the environmental question has been studied
   for decades and diagnoses are legion: capitalism, colonialism,
   overpopulation, economic growth, humanity's inherent short-sightedness,
   patriarchy, the private property system - or the tragedy of the commons,
   the disconnect from nature in Western culture, corporate
   anti-environmental campaigns, the Neolithic adoption of agriculture - or
   its more recent industrialisation, the miscommunication of
   environmentalists and scientists, Christianity and neoliberalism have
   all been proposed as fundamental causes of the crisis. Despite this long
   and rich history of debate, it may be, as Pierre Charbonnier argues,
   that we need a more precise understanding of the `ecological question'
   to find a way out of the present impasse. In line with Katrina Forrester
   and Sophie Smith's argument, we are convinced that such rethinking of
   the environmental must be historical, but also that it must pay special
   attention to economic aspects. Since the end of the Second World War,
   economics has risen to prominence as a form of expertise in governance
   at the expense of other kinds of knowledge, and the environment has
   become closely intertwined with the economic in the ways it has been
   governed. In that light, it is not surprising that current discussions
   among scholars, climate scientists, politicians and social movements
   hold that the environmental crisis calls for a reevaluation of the
   economic. History is central to this endeavour and can be `usable' in
   the current crisis, as it, in Deborah Coen's words, can `reveal the
   contingent and often contradictory traces of the past in the present -
   and to provide clarity for the future'. In this introduction we discuss
   three partially overlapping ways in which historical perspectives can be
   helpful to the effort of constructing an ecologically stable society. In
   contrast to the general tendency in the twenty-first century academy to
   divide into ever more specialised fields, we call for a broader
   conversation among historians of the economic and of the environmental
   to reveal the paths that brought us here - and the ones not taken. We
   need new histories of thought, institutions, movements and governance
   that combine the economic and the environmental to reach a better
   understanding of the present crisis, decode the specific mechanisms of
   inaction in the face of looming catastrophe, and strive towards more apt
   formulations of the environmental. We wish to contribute to an emerging
   conversation located at the intersection of history of economic thought,
   intellectual history and political history more generally by pointing to
   strands of research that could be drawn together and that this special
   issue is meant to engage in dialogue.},

Abstract = {Preparedness to adapt to the impacts of climate change was assessed for
   three important sectors of activity within the Irish coastal and marine
   environment, namely tourism, fisheries, and conservation of
   biodiversity. Information on the current status of each sector is a
   valuable point of reference in terms of accessing contribution to the
   implementation of future national adaptation efforts. A modified version
   of the National Adaptive Capacity (NAC) framework developed by the World
   Resources Institute was used to assess the three sectors of activity.
   This framework is structured around five functions: assessment,
   prioritisation, coordination, information management, and climate risk
   reduction; results of the assessment suggest that all three sectors are
   at the nascent stages of the climate change adaptation process.
   Currently there is no dedicated national policy guidance or legal
   support mechanism on adaptation in Ireland; hence there is no national
   financial commitment to support implementation of adaptation actions for
   any of the sectors assessed. Subjecting these three selected sectors of
   activity to such an assessment enables identification of existing
   actions that can potentially support current adaptation, as well as
   where issues such as knowledge gaps and lack of policy support hinder
   progress. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Paris Agreement sets a long-term temperature goal of holding the
   global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C, and
   pursuing efforts to limit this to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial
   levels. Here, we present an overview of science and policy aspects
   related to this goal and analyse the implications for mitigation
   pathways. We show examples of discernible differences in impacts between
   1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming. At the same time, most available
   low emission scenarios at least temporarily exceed the 1.5 degrees C
   limit before 2100. The legacy of temperature overshoots and the
   feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C, or below, thus become
   central elements of a post-Paris science agenda. The near-term
   mitigation targets set by countries for the 2020-2030 period are
   insufficient to secure the achievement of the temperature goal. An
   increase in mitigation ambition for this period will determine the
   Agreement's effectiveness in achieving its temperature goal.},

Abstract = {For the past two decades, the need to shield strategic maritime
   interests, to tackle criminality and terrorismat or from the sea and to
   conserve valuable marine resources has been recognized at the highest
   political level. Acknowledging and accounting for the interplay between
   climate change, the vulnerability of coastal populations and the
   occurrence of maritime criminality should be part of any ocean
   governance process. Still, given the complex interactions between
   climate change and socio-economic components of the marine realm, it has
   become urgent to establish a solid methodological framework, which could
   lead to sound and effective decisions. We propose that any such
   framework should not be built from scratch. The adaptation of well
   tested, existing uncertainty-management tools, such as Cumulative Effect
   Assessments, could serve as a solid basis to account for the magnitude
   and directionality of the dependencies between the impacts of climate
   change and the occurrence of maritime criminality, offering spatial
   explicit risk evaluations. Multi-Criteria Decision Making could then be
   employed to better and faster inform decision-makers. These mechanisms
   could provide a framework for comparison of alternative mitigation and
   adaptation actions and are essential in assessing responses to tackle
   maritime crime in the context of climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The Indo-Pacific lionfish Pterois volitans has invaded western Atlantic
   Ocean coastal habitats over the past 2 decades and has the potential to
   cause major ecological changes in reef fish communities. While many
   aspects of lionfish ecology in their invaded range have been examined,
   there is a paucity of information on movements of lionfish, particularly
   adults. We surgically implanted ultrasonic transmitters into 25 lionfish
   at a natural hard bottom area off North Carolina (USA) in December 2008
   and February 2009, and used an array of remote underwater receivers to
   monitor movements in the study area for up to 6 mo. We also affixed a
   control transmitter in the study area to assess changes in transmitter
   detection rate as a function of multiple variables, and used a
   generalized additive model to show that the control transmitter
   detection rate declined with time, increasing water temperature, and
   increasing wave period. Despite variable detection probabilities, we
   found that telemetered lionfish remaining in the study area displayed
   high site fidelity to areas no broader than 400 m in diameter; daily
   movements were nearly always < 150 m. By estimating variable detection
   rates of transmitters and lionfish movements, we provided information
   that can be useful in understanding the spatial scale of lionfish impact
   and developing management or mitigation strategies for this invasive
   species.},

Abstract = {Kenya is among the first countries in sub-Saharan Africa to formally
   require the assessment of public policies, plans and programs. National
   strategic environmental assessment (SEA) guidelines were finalized in
   2012 to adapt and enhance SEA practice in the Kenyan context. The
   purpose of this research was to examine recent Kenyan SEA, with a
   particular emphasis on public participation, by developing and applying
   an analysis framework that both incorporates commonly accepted SEA
   principles and approaches and is cognizant of the national context in
   shaping SEA practice. Results reveal that a number of SEA practices are
   consistent with the framework in the nine cases considered, such as
   containing standard SEA components and developing monitoring plans. A
   requirement that each SEA must include educating the public about SEA is
   an innovative local adaptation. Results also show a number of practices
   that are still emerging, such as initiating SEA early and disseminating
   results to the participants. We conclude that SEA is still developing in
   Kenya, but processes for conducting it are slowly adapting to the Kenyan
   context.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a growing threat to marine organisms and ecosystems,
   and it is already modifying ocean properties by, for example, increasing
   temperature and decreasing pH. Increasing water temperature may also
   lead to an impairment of primary productivity and an overall depletion
   of available zooplankton. Understanding how the crossover between
   warming and zooplankton availability impacts fish populations has
   paramount implications for conservation and mitigation strategies.
   Through a cross factorial design to test the effects of ocean
   temperature and food availability in a temperate marine teleost,
   Pomatochistus flavescens, we showed that hindered feeding impacted
   sheltering and avoidance behaviour. Also, low food availability impaired
   fish reproduction, particularly male reproduction, as the expression of
   cyp11b1, a gene with a pivotal role in the synthesis of the most
   important fish androgen, 11-ketotestosterone, was significantly reduced
   under a low food regime. In contrast, temperature alone did not affect
   reproductive success, but offspring showed increased saturated fatty
   acid content (embryos) and increased lipid peroxidation (larvae).
   Altogether, food availability had a stronger effect on fitness, showing
   that coping with elevated temperatures, an ability that may be expected
   in shallow-water fish, can be indirectly impacted, or even overwhelmed,
   by the effects of ocean warming on primary productivity and downstream
   ecological processes.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Global warming and environmental changes have resulted in more frequent
   and extreme weather events, as well as larger-scale disasters around the
   world. This study presents a disaster risk analysis in Taiwan coastal
   area using the Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) and examines the
   strategies adopted by the coastal residents of Taiwan, through a new
   concept of ``copability{''} analysis. Based on the results, the majority
   of the coastal regions fall under the medium-to-low resilient category
   with the south-western and northern coast of Taiwan as the most
   high-risk regions posing a high risk to millions of people facing
   climatic disasters in the future. The coping mechanisms used by local
   residents are also influenced by the socioeconomic status of the
   decision-makers as well as the synchronization of disasters. Based on
   the findings, a 4R management package is developed in which the
   copability and resilience management strategy are squeezed into four
   main sectors of resource, reason, roadmap, and respond to work towards a
   more coordinated management and use of natural resources across sectors
   and scales. It is advised that all governmental, private, and community
   actors implement coherent climate risk management measures, accompanied
   by mitigation initiatives, in order to establish a sustainable level of
   climate resilience in cities.},

Abstract = {The Cameroonian agricultural sector, a critical part of the local
   ecosystem, is potentially vulnerable to climate change, thus raising
   concerns about food security in the country's future. Adaptations
   policies may be able to mitigate some of this vulnerability. This
   article addresses the issue of selected adaptation options within the
   context of Cameroonian food production. A methodology is applied where
   transient diagnostics of two atmosphere-ocean general circulation
   models, the NASA/Goddard Institute GISS and the British HadCM3, are
   coupled to a cropping system simulation model (CropSyst). This
   methodology simulates current and future (2020, 2080) crop yields for
   selected key crops such as bambara nut, groundnut, maize, sorghum, and
   soybean, in eight agricultural regions of Cameroon. Our results show
   that for the future, substantial yield increases are estimated for
   bambara groundnut, soybean and groundnut, while little or no change or
   even decreases for maize and sorghum yields, varying according to the
   climate scenario and the agricultural region investigated. Taking the
   ``no regrets{''} principle into consideration, we also explore the
   advantages of specific adaptation strategies specifically for three
   crops, maize, sorghum and bambara groundnut, under GISS A2 and B2 marker
   scenarios only. Here, changing sowing dates may be ineffective in
   counteracting adverse climatic effects because of the narrow rainfall
   band that strictly determines the timing of farm operations in Cameroon.
   In contrast, the possibility of developing later maturing new cultivars
   proved to be very effective in offsetting adverse impacts, giving the
   highest increases in productivity under different scenario projections
   without management changes. For example, under climate change scenario
   GISS A2 2080, a 14.6\% reduction in maize yield was converted to a
   32.1\% increase; a 39.9\% decrease in sorghum yield was converted to a
   17.6\% increase, and for bambara groundnut, yields were almost trebled
   due to increase length of growing period and the positive effects of
   higher CO2 concentrations. These results better inform wider studies and
   development strategies on sustainable agriculture in the area by
   providing an indication as to the potential direction in shifts in
   production capabilities. Our approach highlights the benefit of using
   models as tools to investigate potential climate change impacts, where
   results can supplement existing knowledge. The findings also provide
   useful guidance and motivation to public authorities and development
   agencies interested in food security issues in Cameroon and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {This paper presents CO2 mitigation potential in the power sector of
   Thailand regarding to the Power Development Plan (PDP 2015) and
   Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2015). Renewable energy and
   advanced technology have the potential to play an important role in
   providing clean energy. The Long-range Energy Alternative Planning
   (LEAP) model is used to analyze future electricity demand, fuel
   consumption and CO2 emissions reduction in the long term planning during
   2010-2050. Regarding to those plans, implementations of renewable energy
   and advanced technology are proposed for mitigation options. The
   mitigation scenarios offer sustainable potential of renewable
   technologies and advanced technologies such as solar, wind, biomass,
   nuclear, hydropower, hydrogen fuel cell, tidal, geothermal and
   fossil-fuel power plants with carbon capture storage (CCS). Four
   mitigation scenarios are modeled along with the BAU scenario. The
   Mitigation 1 (MIT01) scenario is the base-case mitigation scenario based
   on the target of PDP2015, which target of renewable energy is 19,634 MW
   in 2036. In the Mitigation 2 (MIT02) scenario, the technologies in the
   MIT01 plus new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell, tidal and
   geothermal are implemented. Clean fossil fuel technologies with CCS, for
   example natural gas and coal technologies; arc applied in the Mitigation
   3 (MIT03) scenario. In the Mitigation 4 (MIT04) scenario as the peak CO2
   scenario. Results show that, in the BAU scenario, electricity demand and
   CO2 emissions from the power sector will increase to 52,770 ktoe and
   345,959 kt-CO2eq, respectively in 2050. By adopting mitigation options,
   total CO2 emissions in 2050 can be mitigated by 69.66\% in MIT04,
   following by 50.83\% in MIT02, 47.22\% in MIT03, and 41.71\% in MHIT01
   when compared to the BAU scenario. Moreover, regarding to the MIT04,
   Thailand can meet its peak CO2 emission by 2036. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {Pacific Island countries are among the countries most vulnerable to
   climate change and to disaster risks and variability. This chapter
   discusses lessons learned from selected PICs on the role of e-government
   in implementing climate adaptation and disaster risk management, with a
   focus on two separate regional policy drivers for climate change: the
   2005-2015 Pacific Islands Framework for Climate Change Adaptation and
   the 2005-2015 Pacific Disaster Risk Management Framework for Action. The
   chapter also highlights the transition to a new regional `Framework for
   Resilient Development in the Pacific: An Integrated Approach to Address
   Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management 2017-2030. These regional
   policies are relevant to PIC commitments to the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework
   and the Sustainable Development Goals and PICs use information and
   communication technologies in early warning systems, adaptation,
   mitigation and disaster response and recovery initiatives. The challenge
   for individual PICs has been to establish national policies and programs
   that made beneficial use of the ICT capabilities available to them to
   drive the achievements of these policy/framework targets as relevant to
   their national priorities.},

Abstract = {There is a growing capability to project the impacts and economic
   effects of climate change across multiple sectors. This information is
   needed to inform decisions regarding the diversity and magnitude of
   future climate impacts and explore how mitigation and adaptation actions
   might affect these risks. Here, we summarize results from sectoral
   impact models applied within a consistent modelling framework to project
   how climate change will affect 22 impact sectors of the United States,
   including effects on human health, infrastructure and agriculture. The
   results show complex patterns of projected changes across the country,
   with damages in some sectors (for example, labour, extreme temperature
   mortality and coastal property) estimated to range in the hundreds of
   billions of US dollars annually by the end of the century under high
   emissions. Inclusion of a large number of sectors shows that there are
   no regions that escape some mix of adverse impacts. Lower emissions, and
   adaptation in relevant sectors, would result in substantial economic
   benefits.},

Abstract = {In Focus: Morrongiello, J. R., Sweetman, P. C., \& Thresher, R. E.
   (2019). Fishing constrains phenotypic responses of marine fish to
   climate variability. Journal of Animal Ecology, 88, 1645-1656. Forces of
   unnatural selection, such as climate change and harvest, are rarely
   studied in concert, yet hold the great potential to act synergistically
   on individual performance, susceptibility to harvest, tolerance to
   warming temperatures, and ultimately population persistence and
   resilience. In this paper, Morrongiello et al. (2019) used long-term
   monitoring of a site-attached temperate reef fish, the purple wrasse
   (Notolabrus fucicola), to test novel predictions about how fisheries
   management and climate variability could alter individual growth rates
   and thermal reaction norms within and across stocks. Otolith growth
   increments were collected from three south-east Australian populations
   between 1980 and 1999, pre- and post-harvest, throughout an intensive
   warming spell. Using hierarchical models to partition variation in
   growth within and between individuals and populations, Morrongiello et
   al. detected increased average growth rate with warming, a release from
   density dependence post-harvest, and a fishing-by-warming interaction
   that decreased diversity in thermal growth reaction norms because large
   individuals that tend to better tolerate warm temperatures were
   effectively culled from the population. This study outlines the
   importance of determining which phenotypes are more resilient to
   increasing temperatures, how fisheries should manage for them, and how
   such collective knowledge could help preserve and even promote
   resilience of managed populations to increasing temperatures in
   ecosystems threatened by climate change.},

   sea level rise: An Indonesian insight},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {171},
Pages = {11-18},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Climate change and sea level rise (SLR) poses serious risks to coastal
   communities around the world requiring nations to apply adaptation laws
   and policies. Climate change will exacerbate the existing threats to
   vulnerable communities, such as the poor, and threaten the food security
   of populations in coastal areas through the effects of flooding due to
   coastal inundation. Indonesia is an Archipelagic State of over 17,000
   islands and is vulnerable to climate change impacts in its coastal areas
   and especially in its highly populated low lying delta areas, such as
   Jakarta and Semarang, where vulnerability to sea level rise is evident.
   The adequacy of the legal adaptation framework in Indonesia to respond
   to this climate vulnerability is assessed and it is found to have
   limited consideration of the community burden arising from these climate
   and SLR uncertainties. A more inclusive social justice approach could
   assist government to respond to the impacts from these issues and to
   their implications for vulnerable groups. The nation can improve
   adaptive legal measures to address climate change impacts and increase
   the involvement of local people in climate change adaptation decision
   making. Funding is required to assist policy makers to further
   incorporate adaptation into decision making, and this could improve
   social justice outcomes for vulnerable Indonesian coastal communities.},

   during a heat wave. The numerical model couples computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) simulations of wind flow with the heat and moisture
   transport (HAM) in urban materials in order to document the behavior of
   urban materials in terms of moisture storage and transport in urban
   settings. By resolving the physical processes at urban local scale, we
   aim to provide a framework for the development of sustainable and

Abstract = {The imperative of adapting cities to risks associated with climate
   change will reveal the strong potential of political and administrative
   action at the level of local urban governments. Action at this level
   facilitates adaptation solutions that are closely linked to the specific
   needs, wants and capacities of local communities and economies. At the
   same time, the need to adapt to climate related impacts creates new, and
   in many cases, unprecedented challenges for local governments, often
   exceeding their current capacities in terms of risk awareness, expert
   knowledge, access to information, finance, or legal responsibility. This
   paradox is most apparent in emerging economies that have recently
   undergone, or are currently experiencing, political and economic
   transformations, including (re-)orientation towards market-oriented
   economies, administrative liberalisation, decentralisation, dynamic
   urbanisation and changing socio-political paradigms. Drawing on
   empirical research based on coastal and delta cities in Vietnam,
   focusing particularly on the example of Can Tho City in the Mekong
   Delta, this paper analyses the challenges local urban governments face
   with respect to formulating and implementing climate change adaptation
   strategies for their city in the context of transformation. The paper
   argues that challenges are particularly evident in the fields of urban
   growth and expansion, administrative reform and decentralisation, the
   fragmentation of sector responsibilities, the broadening of the actor
   spectrum and planning and management paradigms. Lessons learned can be
   utilised for other local urban governments experiencing similar
   conditions. Knowledge gaps and future research needs are also explored.},

   Over Threshold analysis identified flooding events in a 116-year
   continuous tidal record. An apparent natural break in the data informed
   a ``split{''} in the extreme distribution curve fitting performed,
   though a General Pareto curve was used for both event groupings. The
   resulting GPD curves were used to estimate flood elevations at various
   return intervals, including the 100-year flood. With projected local sea
   level rise superimposed at various planning horizons, these flood
   elevations are being used to identify assets that may be exposed to
   future flood hazards, and prioritize adaptation measures to reduce flood

Abstract = {The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports
   conclude that for Australasia, without adaptation, further changes in
   climate, atmospheric CO2, sea-level rise and ocean acidity are projected
   to have substantial impacts on climate sensitive systems, sectors and
   populations. In the context of varying geographical, social, cultural
   and policy contexts, this paper reviews research contributions and
   activities concerning coastal adaptation to climate change in
   Aotearoa-New Zealand. It reflects on the insights derived from this
   emerging pool of scholarship and considers what lessons have been
   learned to help us address the future challenges of adaptation to
   climate change on our coasts and estuaries. In particular, future
   progress will require strong understanding of natural coastal systems,
   clearer national direction and guidance in balance with regional
   flexibility, and collaborative processes to help communities understand,
   implement and evaluate adaptation pathways for a sustainable and
   resilient future.},

Title = {Exploring the role of bureaucracy in the production of coastal risks,
   City of Cape Town, South Africa},

Abstract = {Cape Town is currently experiencing a range of coastal pressures
   consistent with a warming climate. Notably this includes evidence of a
   receding coastline in certain areas and shifting wind regimes. Coupled
   with an increasing demand for coastal development, the City of Cape Town
   as the administrative authority is presented with an unfolding scenario
   of uncharted waters. From a coastal management perspective this requires
   a reappraisal of its governance strategies. However, this paper
   demonstrates that various governance structures within the City, whilst
   designed to address these challenges, are instead competing with, and
   undermining each other. In the context of a coastal city these dissonant
   governance structures translate into conventional (Weberian) forms of
   bureaucracy that counter efforts at promoting Integrated Coastal
   Management, the key tenets being institutional learning, collaboration,
   deliberation, flexibility and adaptive management. The disjuncture
   between governance structures in turn is restricting the City's ability
   in achieving its own coastal adaption strategies, particularly the
   restoration and maintenance of dune systems as effective `buffers'
   against climate change induced pressures such as sea-level rise and
   storm surges. The procedural rigidity delivered by the bureaucracy is
   instead leading to a `pathology': risks are being created and their
   production perpetuated by the bureaucracy charged with mitigating these
   risks. We suggest that the role of informal networks are explored as a
   means to circumvent the `necessary evil' of bureaucracy, towards
   enabling stronger degrees of Integrated Coastal Management and
   ultimately successful climate change adaptation responses. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Climate change driven alterations in the distribution and abundance of
   marine species, and the timing of their life history events (phenology),
   are being reported around the globe. However, we have limited capacity
   to detect and predict these responses, even for comparatively well
   studied commercial fishery species. Fisheries provide significant
   socio-economic benefits for many coastal communities, and early warning
   of potential changes to fish stocks will provide managers and other
   stakeholders with the best opportunity to adapt to these impacts. Rapid
   assessment methods that can estimate the sensitivity of species to
   climate change in a wide range of contexts are needed. This study
   establishes an objective, flexible and cost effective framework for
   prioritising future ecological research and subsequent investment in
   adaptation responses in the face of resource constraints. We build on an
   ecological risk assessment framework to assess relative sensitivities of
   commercial species to climate change drivers, specifically in relation
   to their distribution, abundance and phenology, and demonstrate our
   approach using key species within the fast warming region of
   south-eastern Australia. Our approach has enabled fisheries managers to
   understand likely changes to fisheries under a range of climate change
   scenarios, highlighted critical research gaps and priorities, and
   assisted marine industries to identify adaptation strategies that
   maximise positive outcomes.},

Abstract = {Many protected areas may not be adequately safeguarding biodiversity
   from human activities on surrounding lands and global change. The
   magnitude of such change agents and the sensitivity of ecosystems to
   these agents vary among protected areas. Thus, there is a need to assess
   vulnerability across networks of protected areas to determine those most
   at risk and to lay the basis for developing effective adaptation
   strategies. We conducted an assessment of exposure of U.S. National
   Parks to climate and land use change and consequences for vegetation
   communities. We first defined park protected-area centered ecosystems
   (PACEs) based on ecological principles. We then drew on existing land
   use, invasive species, climate, and biome data sets and models to
   quantify exposure of PACEs from 1900 through 2100. Most PACEs
   experienced substantial change over the 20th century (>740\% average
   increase in housing density since 1940, 13\% of vascular plants are
   presently nonnative, temperature increase of 1 degrees C/100 yr since
   1895 in 80\% of PACEs), and projections suggest that many of these
   trends will continue at similar or increasingly greater rates (255\%
   increase in housing density by 2100, temperature increase of 2.5
   degrees-4.5 degrees C/100 yr, 30\% of PACE areas may lose their current
   biomes by 2030). In the coming century, housing densities are projected
   to increase in PACEs at about 82\% of the rate of since 1940. The rate
   of climate warming in the coming century is projected to be 2.5-5.8
   times higher than that measured in the past century. Underlying these
   averages, exposure of individual park PACEs to change agents differ in
   important ways. For example, parks such as Great Smoky Mountains exhibit
   high land use and low climate exposure, others such as Great Sand Dunes
   exhibit low land use and high climate exposure, and a few such as Point
   Reyes exhibit high exposure on both axes. The cumulative and synergistic
   effects of such changes in land use, invasives, and climate are expected
   to dramatically impact ecosystem function and biodiversity in national
   parks. These results are foundational to developing effective adaptation
   strategies and suggest policies to better safeguard parks under
   broad-scale environmental change.},

Abstract = {Adaptive governance has been recognized as an integrative approach for
   analyzing the social, institutional, ecologic, and economic aspects of
   decision-making to build resilience against climate change. Although
   closely aligned with adaptive co-management and ecosystem management,
   adaptive governance is a distinct framework that explicitly focuses on
   decentralized decision-making through social processes such as
   collaborative learning, networking, and the promotion of cross-sectoral
   partnerships to enhance adaptive capacity. In this paper, we explore an
   ongoing engagement process for climate change adaptation planning in
   Exeter, New Hampshire, and its alignment with key principles of adaptive
   governance. Climate change poses multiple challenges to Exeter,
   including increased flooding, reduced low flows, water quality
   degradation, and associated threats to estuarine ecosystems and public
   health. Engagement strategies include community conversations,
   workshops, experiential activities, and a community advisory board
   comprised of different stakeholder representatives (Citizens' Working
   Group) collaborating with the scientific team on water resources
   modeling and scenario analysis. We present important lessons about
   conveying expectations and timeframes of technical modeling to
   participants, developing multiple forums for interaction between
   researchers and other stakeholders, and making climate change locally
   relevant to residents by drawing connections to the community's
   experiences, cultural memory, values, and upcoming decisions. This study
   contributes to the literature on adaptive governance and climate change
   adaptation by evaluating stakeholder involvement in a local
   institutional setting, an important arena where adaptation decisions
   must be deliberated. It is also among the first studies to evaluate the
   ways in which a climate change adaptation stakeholder engagement process
   aligns with adaptive governance principles, particularly through
   boundary objects and experiences.},

Abstract = {Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is being
   proclaimed as ``a new direction in forest conservation{''} (Anglesen,
   2009: 125). This financial incentives-based climate change mitigation
   strategy proposed by the UNEP, World Bank, GEF and environmental NGOs
   seeks to integrate forests into carbon sequestration schemes. Its
   proponents view REDD+ as part of an adaptive strategy to counter the
   effects of global climate change. This paper combines the theoretical
   approaches of market environmentalism and environmental narratives to
   examine the politics of environmental knowledge that are redefining
   socio-nature relations in the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania to make mangrove
   forests amenable to markets. Through a case study of a
   ``REDD-readiness{''} climate change mitigation and adaptation project,
   we demonstrate how a shift in resource control and management from local
   to global actors builds upon narratives of environmental change (forest
   loss) that have little factual basis in environmental histories. We
   argue that the proponents of REDD+ (Tanzanian state, aid donors,
   environmental NGOs) underestimate the agency of forest-reliant
   communities who have played a major role in the making of the delta
   landscape and who will certainly resist the injustices they are facing
   as a result of this shift from community-based resource management to
   fortress conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the changing states of the food resources in the
   Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem under multiple stressors from 1958 to
   2015, including the changing states of biomass yields, species
   composition, trophic level and biodiversity. The results show that the
   changing trends were contrary to expectation. There were no significant
   declines in biomass yields, trophic level and biodiversity after the
   1980s. The major decline observed occurred before the 1980s. However,
   the species composition changed a lot, that is, over the past half
   century there were two different types of species shift in YSLME under
   multiple stresses. One was from demersal, high value species to pelagic,
   lower value species shift during 1958-59 to 1998-2000, and the other was
   from pelagic, lower value species to demersal, low value species shift
   during 1998-2000-2014-15. For future sustainable development, it is
   still necessary to further strengthen adaptive management.},

Title = {Harnessing the temporal and projective attributes of human agency to
   promote anticipatory climate change adaptation},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE},
Abstract = {Human agency is seen as a critical component of adaptive capacity
   concerning environmental change. This capacity may entail social actor's
   ability to learn from past experience, and create opportunities in the
   present for dealing with uncertainty and change in the future. However,
   it also means that actors need to be able to overturn structural
   barriers that impede anticipatory adaptation to climate change such as
   lack of political leadership, power imbalances, acceptance of climate
   risks and willingness to act. While scholarship around questions of
   structural barriers is common in environmental studies literature, there
   is less understanding about how future thinking could help to strengthen
   human agency. Harnessing the temporal and projective attributes of human
   agency by which social actors can exert influence over the future and
   create solutions may comprise a promising way forward. This paper
   investigates how social actors understand past social and environmental
   change and explores how scenario planning may help actors apply their
   understanding of changes over time to devise policies for climate change
   adaptation. The paper applies this exploratory lens to an Australian
   coastal local government area engaged in scenario planning and
   adaptation pathways planning. Findings indicate that the temporality
   aspect of agency applied to solving complex issues and overcoming
   structural barriers manifests differently from an individual to a
   collective perspective. This means that while scenario planning and
   adaptation pathways planning helps with anticipatory identification and
   experimentation, this may not be sufficient to overturn structural
   barriers to adaptation in the short-term.},

   Ocean-Climate Policy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {The ocean is gaining prominence in climate change policy circles as a
   tool for addressing the climate crisis. Blue carbon, the carbon captured
   and stored by marine and coastal ecosystems and species, offers
   potential as a ``nature-based solution{''} to climate change. The
   protection and restoration of specific ocean ecosystems can form part of
   a climate response within climate mitigation policies such as Nationally
   Determined Contributions under the United Nations Framework Convention
   on Climate Change. For mitigation policies that seek to implement
   management actions that drawdown carbon, ecosystem sequestration and
   emissions must be measurable across temporal and spatial scales, and
   management must be practical leading to improved sequestration and
   avoided emissions. However, some blue carbon interventions may not be
   suitable as a climate mitigation response and better suited for other
   policy instruments such as those targeted toward biodiversity
   conservation. This paper gives context to numerous blue carbon
   sequestration pathways, quantifying their potential to sequester carbon
   from the atmosphere, and comparing these sequestration pathways to
   point-source emissions reductions. The applicability of blue carbon is
   then discussed in terms of multiple international policy frameworks, to
   help individuals and institutions utilize the appropriate framework to
   reach ocean conservation and climate mitigation goals.},

   Utilization of Quasi-Photosynthetic Absorption as Two Ultimate Solutions
   for CO2 Mitigation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {This paper reviews five potential solutions for CO2 mitigation and
   theoretically analyzes related outstanding questions. Emission trading
   under the global mitigation objectives and policies is in dilemma
   because reducing emission while utilizing fossil fuels is a difficult
   balance. CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) technique offers a
   comprehensive solution, but it is risky and expensive. Analyses of the
   100\% renewable energy plan suggest hydrogen as a fuel of zero CO2
   emission. Photocatalytic splitting of natural seawater can be an
   ultimate scheme for the hydrogen production, providing that the
   associated technological constraints would be overcome. Soil CO2
   absorption in the arid regions (terms such absorption
   ``quasi-photosynthetic absorption{''}) implies a potential solution, but
   the kinetics and overall importance are undetermined. Further
   investigations of these unresolved issues are strongly needed to realize
   the global CO2 mitigation target. Comparing the five potential
   solutions, photocatalytic H-2-production from natural seawater and the
   utilization of quasi-photosynthetic absorption are highlighted as two
   ultimate solutions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {42-56},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Study Region: Eight U.S. states bordering the North American Laurentian
   Great Lakes.
   Study Focus: Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model simulations,
   based on data from an ensemble of atmospheric-ocean general circulation
   models (AOGCMs) used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's
   (IPCC's) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), were used to quantify potential
   climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrology in the study
   region and understand implications for its tourism sector.
   New Hydrologic Insights for the Region: By the 2080s, climate change
   could result in winters that are shorter by over a month, reductions of
   over a month in days with snow depths required for many kinds of winter
   recreation, declines in average holiday snow depths of 50 percent or
   more, and reductions in the percent area of the study region that would
   be considered viable for winter tourism from about 22 percent to 0.3
   percent. Days with temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking
   decline to less than a month annually, making it potentially less
   feasible as an adaptation strategy. All of the region's current ski
   resorts are operating in areas that will become non-viable for winter
   tourism businesses under a high emissions scenario. Given the economic
   importance of the winter tourism industry in the study region,
   businesses and communities should consider climate change and potential
   adaptation strategies in their future planning and overall
   decision-making.},

Title = {An integrated risk assessment of coastal erosion based on fuzzy set
   theory along Fujian coast, southeast China},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion and accumulation has always existed and contributed to
   the shaping of the present coastlines. However, coastal erosion now is
   largely intensified due to human activities, causing severe land loss
   and aggravated financial burden, which is not acceptable. This paper
   presents an integrated methodology for risk assessment of coastal
   erosion, aiming at assessing and mapping coastal erosion risk by
   integrating hazard, exposure and coping capacity to give risk priority
   and risk mappings to guide coastal erosion risk management. Delphi
   method, the analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy set theory were
   adopted in the study to establish the methodology. Fujian province
   situated at southeast China was taken as a case study; the final result
   was effectively supported by the data and provided lots of important
   information for coastal management. The final risk priority recorded the
   risk disparities from place to place and ranked them with distinct
   levels to emphasize those places of higher risk levels which needed
   urgent mitigation measures for risk reduction, and risk mapping gave a
   visual and clear impression of risk distribution. The risk priority and
   mapping was only the first step to coastal erosion management;
   identification of priority areas, implementation of mitigation measures
   and regular maintenance and monitoring are advanced jobs need to be
   done. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Can Coastal Habitats Rise to the Challenge? Resilience of Estuarine

Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) and obstructions to sediment delivery pose
   challenges to the persistence of estuarine habitats and the ecosystem
   services they provide. Restoration actions and sediment management
   strategies may help mitigate such challenges by encouraging the vertical
   accretion of sediment in and horizontal migration of tidal forests and
   marshes. We used a process-based soil accretion model (Coastal Wetland
   Equilibrium Model) combined with a habitat classification model
   (MOSAICS) to estimate the effects of SLR, suspended sediment, and inland
   habitat migration on estuarine habitats, soil carbon accumulation, and
   economic value of climate change mitigation of carbon accumulation
   (social cost of carbon dioxide) in a macrotidal estuary in the northwest
   USA over 100 years (2011 to 2110). Under present-day sediment levels, we
   projected that after 100 years, most high salt marsh would remain with <
   100 cm SLR, but substantial area converted to transitional (low) salt
   marsh and mudflat with >= 100 cm SLR. Increasing sediment availability
   increased the projected resilience of transitional salt marsh to SLR but
   did not prevent declines in high marsh area. Projected total carbon
   accumulation plateaued or declined with >= 100 cm SLR, yet the economic
   value of carbon accumulation continued to rise over time, suggesting
   that the value of this ecosystem service was resilient to SLR. Doubling
   or tripling sediment availability increased projected carbon
   accumulation up to 7.69 and 14.2 kg m(-2) and increased total economic
   value up to \$373,000 and \$710,000, respectively. Allowing marsh
   migration supported conversion of upland to freshwater marsh, with
   slight increases in carbon accumulation. These results inform climate
   adaptation planning for wetland managers seeking to understand the
   resilience of estuarine habitats and ecosystem services to SLR under
   multiple management strategies.},

Title = {Context and climate change: An integrated assessment for Barrow, Alaska},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {82},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {93-111},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {An intensive approach to Barrow, Alaska's adaptations to climate change
   and variability during recent decades suggests reconsideration of the
   interconnected roles of science, policy, and decision-making structures.
   First, profound uncertainties are inherent in unique interactions among
   the many natural and human factors affecting Barrow's vulnerability.
   Science cannot significantly reduce these uncertainties through
   extensive approaches, but intensive approaches can reconstruct and
   update local trends, clarify the underlying dynamics, and harvest
   experience for policy purposes. Second, sound policies to reduce
   Barrow's vulnerability to coastal erosion and flooding must incorporate
   these profound uncertainties and the multiple values of the community.
   Minimizing vulnerability to climate change is only one of the
   community's interests, and must compete with other interests for limited
   time, attention, funds and other resources. Third, the community itself
   is in the best position to understand its own context, to decide on
   sound policies, and to take responsibility for those decisions. In
   short, local context matters in science, policy, and decision-making
   structures for adaptation to climate change and variability. Overall,
   cognitive constraints may be the most important human dimension of
   climate change. Factoring the global problem into more tractable local
   problems would make the most of our cognitive capacity.},

Abstract = {The 4th IPCC report highlights the increased vulnerability of the
   coastal areas from floods due to sea-level rise (SLR). The existing
   coastal flood control structures in Bangladesh are not adequate to adapt
   these changes and new measures are urgently necessary. It is important
   to determine the impacts of SLR on flooding to analyse the performance
   of the existing structures and corresponding impact to plan for suitable
   adaptation and mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of floods on
   coastal zone. The study aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of
   the possible effects of SLR on floods in the coastal zone of Bangladesh.
   A hydrodynamic model, which is a combination of surface and river parts,
   was utilized for flood simulation. The tool was applied under a range of
   future scenarios, and results indicate both spatial variability of risk
   and changes in flood characteristics between now and under SLR.
   Estimated impact on population, infrastructure and transportation is
   also exposed. These types of impact estimation would be of value to
   flood plain management authorities to minimize the socio-economic
   impact.},

Title = {Perceptions matter: household adaptive capacity and capability in two

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {1141-1151},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper presents empirical data on household perceptions of
   capability to adapt to climate hazards and associated capacity needs.
   Households play an important role in responding to the impact of a
   changing climate by creating a functional link between individual and
   community responses to change. However, household perspectives on their
   capacity needs are rarely sought in programs seeking to provide
   incentives for household action-despite the influence of normative
   values and perceptions on household action. Rather, interventions are
   often informed by quantitative measures of adaptive capacity, such as
   access to financial or social capital. An alternative approach involves
   analysis of social narratives of capability that reflect normative
   perceptions of climate risk and capacity needs. Implementation of this
   approach reveals that a significant number of households in vulnerable
   locations consider existing capacities sufficient to manage familiar
   climate hazards, regardless of socio-economic circumstance. Our
   comparative study of two Australian coastal communities also suggests
   that a dominant narrative of capability to manage climate hazards
   reduces the likelihood of household investments in adaptive actions.
   While socio-political influences on narratives are often deeply embedded
   and difficult to change in the short term, identifying perceived risk
   and response capacity is pivotal in determining the likely utility of
   adaptive capacity stocks as measured through quantitative means.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research values the broad benefits of cooling down
   cities, such as improved energy efficiency, worker productivity, air
   quality, health, and equity, at hundreds of millions or even billions of
   dollars to a single city. However, widespread adoption of urban heat
   mitigation programs, such as urban greening and reflective surfaces, has
   been slower than their economic potential suggests it should be. One
   possible cause for this lag is a lack of robust engagement from
   important stakeholders like utilities that could fund and implement heat
   mitigation strategies. This paper highlights the benefits of urban heat
   mitigation and demonstrates how these benefits fit into private utility
   programs' standard cost-benefit tests. This paper serves as an
   introduction on how to include the wide suite of benefits that urban
   heat mitigation programs provide in cost-benefit tests and concludes
   with program design guidance.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing call for local measures to adapt to climate
   change, based on foresight analyses in collaboration with actors.
   However, such analyses involve many challenges, particularly because the
   actors concerned may not consider climate change to be an urgent
   concern. This paper examines the methodological choices made by three
   research teams in the design and implementation of participatory
   foresight analyses to explore agricultural and water management options
   for adaptation to climate change. Case studies were conducted in coastal
   areas of France, Morocco, and Portugal where the groundwater is
   intensively used for irrigation, the aquifers are at risk or are
   currently overexploited, and a serious agricultural crisis is underway.
   When designing the participatory processes, the researchers had to
   address four main issues: whether to avoid or prepare dialogue between
   actors whose relations may be limited or tense; how to select
   participants and get them involved; how to facilitate discussion of
   issues that the actors may not initially consider to be of great
   concern; and finally, how to design and use scenarios. In each case,
   most of the invited actors responded and met to discuss and evaluate a
   series of scenarios. Strategies were discussed at different levels, from
   farming practices to aquifer management. It was shown that such
   participatory analyses can be implemented in situations which may
   initially appear to be unfavourable. This was made possible by the
   flexibility in the methodological choices, in particular the possibility
   of framing the climate change issue in a broader agenda for discussion
   with the actors.},

Title = {The city and urban heat islands: A review of strategies to mitigate

Abstract = {Cities occupy 2\% of the earth's surface but their inhabitants consume
   75\% of the world's energy resources. Under certain conditions, the heat
   from solar radiation and different urban activities can make city
   temperatures rise in certain areas, simply because of the way in which a
   city is structured. This effect is known as the urban heat island (UHI).
   This article provides a review of recent research on the urban heat
   island as well as of the strategies that can be applied to mitigate its
   adverse effects. Such strategies can be applied in the project design
   phase of urban planning and thus directly affect city temperatures on a
   local scale. The elements analyzed in this paper include green spaces,
   trees, albedo, pavement surfaces, vegetation, as well as building types
   and materials. The discussion of this research clearly reflects the
   impact of urban morphology on local temperatures and how urban design
   can be modified to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions into the
   atmosphere. This study is useful for professionals who are responsible
   for decision-making during the design phase of urban planning. (C) 2013

Title = {Hurricane adaptation behaviors in Texas and Florida: exploring the roles
   of negative personal experience and subjective attribution to climate
   change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Understanding the motivation to adopt personal household adaptation
   behaviors in the face of climate change-related hazards is essential for
   developing and implementing behaviorally realistic interventions that
   promote well-being and health. Escalating extreme weather events
   increase the number of those directly exposed and adversely impacted by
   climate change. But do people attribute these negative events to climate
   change? Such subjective attribution may be a cognitive process whereby
   the experience of negative climate-change-related events may increase
   risk perceptions and motivate people to act. Here we surveyed a
   representative sample of 1846 residents of Florida and Texas, many of
   whom had been repeatedly exposed to hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, facing
   the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. We assessed prior hurricane negative
   personal experiences, climate-change-related subjective attribution (for
   hurricanes), risk appraisal (perceived probability and severity of a
   hurricane threat), hurricane adaptation appraisal (perceived efficacy of
   adaptation measures and self-efficacy to address the threat of
   hurricanes), and self-reported hurricane personal household adaptation.
   Our findings suggest that prior hurricane negative personal experiences
   and subjective attribution are associated with greater hurricane risk
   appraisal. Hurricane subjective attribution moderated the relationship
   between hurricane negative personal experiences and risk appraisal; in
   turn, negative hurricane personal experiences, hurricane risk appraisal,
   and adaptation appraisal were positively associated with self-reported
   hurricane personal adaptation behaviors. Subjective attribution may be
   associated with elevated perceived risk for specific climate hazards.
   Communications that help people understand the link between their
   negative personal experiences (e.g. hurricanes) and climate change may
   help guide risk perceptions and motivate protective actions,
   particularly in areas with repeated exposure to threats.},

Title = {Economic impact of climate change and climate change adaptation
   strategies for fisheries sector in Fiji},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {164-170},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Capture fisheries and aquaculture sectors have played major roles in the
   national economy and food security of Fiji. But climate change may place
   substantial stress on these sectors within this archipelago. This paper
   assesses the potential economic impact of two important climate change
   adaptation strategies in Fiji, natural resource management (NRM) and
   aquaculture, using a market fish supply-demand model. The model
   undertakes a comparative analysis of alternative fisheries development
   scenarios for 2035 and 2050, while taking account of the impact of
   climate change on the fisheries sector. The modeling and scenario
   analyses show that promoting aquaculture can help raise aggregate fish
   production, consumption, and trade. However, the required increases in
   aquaculture could be massive. While aqua culture development alone is
   unlikely to meet the growing excess demand for fish in Fiji, it will be
   an important component in adapting to the negative effects of climate
   change on capture fisheries. Various NRM strategies, such as marine
   protected areas (MPAs) and locally managed marine areas (LMMA5), are
   projected to have positive impacts in Fiji, expanding the stock and
   catch of fish. But current efforts on various NRM strategies are too
   small to have any meaningful impact to reverse the declining trends of
   coastal fisheries catch. Efforts would need to be greatly scaled-up to
   achieve significant production gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to have adverse impact on Pakistan. This is
   ironical for a country, which ranks 135th in the world in terms of
   global green house gases (GHG) emissions per capita, but ranks 16th in
   terms of vulnerability to climate change. Climate change poses a major
   threat to all dimensions of sustainable development and has widespread
   impacts across various sectors and ecosystems such as food, water and
   energy; forests and biodiversity; coastal and marine environment; as
   well as on the occurrence and intensity of climate related hazards such
   as floods and drought. It also carries potential for internal and
   external conflicts. The paper examines the present and potential impact
   of climate change in Pakistan, and reviews national policies and plans
   to examine the extent to which climate-related issues have been
   integrated within these. The paper also discusses adaptation and
   mitigation measures and identifies the key elements that need to be
   included in the Climate Change Action Plan of Pakistan and stresses
   their mainstreaming into the national development policies and plans.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {509},

Abstract = {Adverse habitat conditions associated with reduced seawater pH often,
   but not always, negatively affect bivalves in early life history phases.
   Improving our understanding of how habitat-specific parameters affect
   clam recruitment, survival, and growth could assist natural resource
   managers and researchers in developing appropriate adaptation strategies
   for increasingly acidified nearshore ecosystems. Two proposed adaptation
   strategies, the presence of macrophytes and addition of shell hash, have
   the potential to raise local seawater pH and aragonite saturation state
   and, therefore, to improve conditions for shell-forming organisms. This
   field study examined the effects of these two substrate treatments on
   biological and geochemical response variables. Specifically, we measured
   (1) recruitment, survival, and growth of juvenile clams (Ruditapes
   philippinarum) and (2) local water chemistry at Fidalgo Bay and
   Skokomish Delta, Washington, USA, in response to experimental
   manipulations. Results showed no effect of macrophyte or shell hash
   treatment on recruitment or survival of R. philippinarum. Contrary to
   expectations, clam growth was significantly greater in the absence of
   macrophytes, regardless of the presence or absence of shell hash. Water
   column pH was higher outside the macrophyte bed than inside at Skokomish
   Delta and higher during the day than at night at Fidalgo Bay.
   Additionally, pore-water pH and aragonite saturation state were higher
   in the absence of macrophytes and the presence of shell. Based on these
   results, we propose that with increasingly corrosive conditions shell
   hash may help provide chemical refugia under future ocean conditions.
   Thus, we suggest adaptation strategies target the use of shell hash and
   avoidance of macrophytes to improve carbonate chemistry conditions and
   promote clam recruitment, survival, and growth.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal evolution of urban heat Island in Xi'an from 2006 to
   2016},

Abstract = {During the rapid development of urbanization, the urban heat island
   (UHI), becomes one of the major urbanization progress problems that
   affects the environmental, social and ecology profoundly. Analyzing the
   UHI can help understanding the UHI status and the physical
   characteristics of cities, and is significant to provide ecosystem
   management plans and mitigation strategies for the UHI. By utilizing the
   MODIS LST products, Landsat series data and the ecological
   regionalization data, and applying the corresponding methods to derive
   the NDVI, the fractional vegetation cover (F-v) and the LST
   normalizations results, the study conducted the spatial-temporal
   evolution of the UHI in Xi'an from 2006 to 2016. The main work includes
   analyzing the spatial evolution characters, analyzing the temporal
   evolution characters and exploring the relationship between LST and
   vegetation cover. Spatial evolution results showed that the UHI to the
   north of the urban land control line in 2016 became intensified and
   enhanced in the form of increasing the LST and the UHI zone. As for the
   temporal evolution, the Low Temperature Zone and Sub-low Temperature
   Zone had little changes and corresponded with the urban land control
   line, and the Medium Temperature Zone decreased on large area while the
   Sub-high Temperature Zone increased on large area, when compared results
   of 2006 with that of 2016. The relationship between LST and vegetation
   cover indicated that increasing vegetation cover had a certain active
   role for reducing LST and mitigating the UHI. The positive intervention
   and guidance of the government on the ecological protection can reduce
   the UHI, effectively.},

Abstract = {The temperature increase of a city in relation to its peripheral areas
   leads to the formation of an Urban Heat Island. Working on the
   opto-thermal properties of the building envelope is a viable mitigation
   strategy to reduce the temperatures of a city. Having quantitative data
   on energy performance allows the development of precise evaluations and
   the selection of the most efficient data in relation to energy
   consumption. The degree of efficiency of a material is calculated with
   an indicator called Solar Reflectance Index (SRI). Since opto-thermal
   properties change over time, the standard recommends obtaining the SRI
   level of both new and three-year-aged material (SRI3). In the present
   work, 80 facade claddings were evaluated to: (a) determine which
   qualitative variables significantly influence the SRI3 of the claddings;
   (b) obtain an equation that calculates the SRI3 without the need to
   monitor the large number of variables used for its calculation. For
   this, the following statistical methods were used: multifactorial ANOVA
   and linear regression model. In this correlational analysis, color,
   composition and texture were selected as independent variables. The
   research showed that color is the variable that significantly influences
   SRI3 in all the evaluated claddings. By means of the equation obtained
   with the regression model, the SRI3 index was predicted reaching 95\%
   IC. These results significantly save time and simplify the process of
   obtaining data since it is not necessary to monitor numerous input
   variables to calculate the indicator.},

Title = {A richness index for baselining climate change adaptations in small
   island developing states},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) are a uniquely vulnerable suite of
   countries. Climate change is already having disproportionate impacts on
   their biophysical and socio-economic processes. The status of
   national-level climate change adaptation across multiple SIDS is,
   however, under-explored in the academic literature. A pivotal study by
   Lesnikowski a al. (2015) (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-013-9491-x),
   which assessed adaptation outcomes in 117 Parties to the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), only included 13 SIDS,
   a number insufficient to establish a baseline of action in these
   countries. This paper builds on Lesnikowski a al. (2015) and more recent
   SIDS-specific work by Robinson (2017)
   (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-015-9693-5) by coding 441 national
   adaptation actions reported in the National Communications of 35 SIDS
   between 1997 and 2014. It develops a richness index that baselines
   adaptations in these countries, which are located across three main
   geographic regions - the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Caribbean, and
   Pacific. It further identifies more advanced adaptors and less advanced
   adaptors among the group, and finds that, while progress was made in the
   observation and assessment of climate variables (29.7\% of reported
   actions) and planning (25.2\%), less tangible actions were implemented
   (19.0\%) with even less monitoring and evaluation (8.2\%) and
   stakeholder engagement and knowledge management (17.9\%). This paper
   concludes that greater investments in ongoing capacity-building in SIDS
   are required for countries to better plan, implement and evaluate
   adaptation actions, and to better advocate for more optimal levels of
   international financing for helping to underwrite the cost of
   adaptation.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {435-447},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While many scientific assessments have been recommending general
   strategies for biodiversity conservation under climate change,
   translation of these recommendations into specific actions and practice
   has been limited. Focusing on two biomes, rainforest and wetlands in
   biodiverse South East Queensland, Australia, we demonstrate how general
   principles can be translated into specific actions for stakeholders and
   responsible agencies. We synthesize research that is contextualizing
   protection of refugia and habitat connectivity, establishing baseline
   data sets to detect change and developing strategic conservation
   planning scenarios to adjust reserve boundaries or situate new reserves.
   This has been achieved by coupling spatial information on biological
   assets (i.e. ecosystems and species) with future climate scenarios and
   process models to anticipate movement of critical habitats. Conservation
   planning software is also being used to prioritize investment to meet
   specific objectives. This approach is enabling us to identify at-risk
   biological assets, opportunities to ameliorate threats and obstacles to
   delivering regional adaptation actions. A larger total reserved area is
   needed, with proactive planning to capture areas further inland and
   along watercourses. Major obstacles include conflict between
   urbanization and priorities for habitat conservation and the need for
   greater levels of investment for monitoring programmes and to protect
   landward shifted wetlands on private land.},

   for fishing communities in Mumbai},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {90-97},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper assessed the soda-economic implications of climate change and
   vulnerability of fishing communities known as ``Koli{''} living in
   Mumbai, India. The vulnerability indicators are derived from sustainable
   livelihood literature and use of multi-criteria analyses and are
   validated with expert opinions. A survey of two hundred fishermen from
   five fishing villages in Mumbai was conducted to collect data. The
   results demonstrate that vulnerability perpetuates due to physical and
   financial resource constraints among the fishing community. Fishermen
   from Madh and Worli villages are observed to be more vulnerable and less
   adaptive due to their inability to use efficient mechanized boats and
   advanced fishing implements, such as fish finders and GPS (Global
   Positioning System). The divergence in the vulnerability scores among
   fishing villages is attributed to the coping strategies, resource
   availability, knowledge and the benefit derived from the local
   government. Fishermen have been observing the negative impacts of
   climate change on their fishing livelihoods. Adaptation strategies to
   maximize fish catch are observed in such practices as targeting
   different species and fishing intensively for several days. However,
   these practices are leading to an imbalance in the common resource pool
   and biased resource sharing among different groups of fishermen.},

Abstract = {The discourse on vulnerability to climate change presents many
   complexities. Among these are the constant tension between policy makers
   and academics. This paper unpacks these complexities in order to analyze
   how Small Island Developing States (SIDS) deal with the notion of
   vulnerability at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
   Change (UNFCCC). The lack of a clear definition of vulnerability at the
   UNFCCC has created many tensions among developing countries because the
   notion of vulnerability is associated with financial and technical
   resource distribution. However, on a strategic level SIDS have had to
   demonstrate their vulnerabilities within the UNFCCC in order to remain
   relevant and compete with other groups for these resources. This paper
   highlights some of these tensions, especially among developing
   countries, through an indepth analysis of vulnerability within academia
   and foreign policy through the UNFCCC. We argue that competing
   definitions of vulnerability by academics and policymakers evoke
   different methodologies for understanding and measuring vulnerability.
   Further, we find that within the UNFCCC, prioritizing mitigation
   policies over adaptation has increased SIDS' vulnerability.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore the potential of wireframe design and
   evaluation for interactive and web-based mapping through a case study on
   water level visualization. Specifically, our research informed design
   and development of the National Oceanic \& Atmospheric Administration's
   (NOAA) Lake Level Viewer (http://coast.noaa.gov/llv/), an interactive
   and web-based geovisualization application for the Great Lakes region of
   North America. As part of our overall user-centered design process, we
   created two sets of wireframes to evaluate two aspects of the user
   experience: high-fidelity wireframes to illustrate the proposed
   representation solution using real data and low-fidelity wireframes to
   provide a rough sketch of the proposed interaction solution. Eighteen
   target users completed cognitive walkthroughs of the wireframes, with
   the sessions audio-recorded for subsequent transcription and qualitative
   data analysis. The wireframe evaluations led to a series of revisions to
   the functional scope and visual design of the Lake Level Viewer. The
   process also generated recommendations for designing water level
   visualizations supporting adaptive management in response to climate
   change as well as for leveraging wireframes in support of large-scale
   mapping and GIS projects.},

Pages = {5-10},

Abstract = {Achieving food and nutritional security in a scenario of degrading
   natural resources (water, soil, biodiversity) and climate change seems
   to be a big challenge. Global warming has triggered the melting of
   glaciers, sea level rise and submergence of islands/coastal areas, and
   change in rainfall and temperature pattern over the next century is
   predicted. Such change is bound to affect water, land and biodiversity
   patterns which will demand a new set of land-use patterns including
   enterprises, commodities, crops and varieties. Effects of climate change
   have already started impacting on agricultural productivity in several
   agroclimatic regions and subregions of India. The likely predicted
   scenario of climate change on agriculture, location-specific case
   studies depicting climate change impacts such as drought, cold and
   heatwaves and required adaptation and mitigation strategies are
   discussed in this paper. It is emphasized that adaptations of
   agriculture to climate change will call upon proactive or anticipatory
   research on enterprises, commodities, crops, varieties and farming
   systems resilient to cold, heat and moisture stresses. Copyright (C)

Title = {Local knowledge and democracy in fisheries management: a case study of
   adaptation to the Anthropocene in southeast Louisiana},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The onset of the Anthropocene necessitates new forms of environmental
   planning and management as communities adapt to new ecological
   realities. Despite the global reach of the Anthropocene, localized
   adaptation strategies are critical for a successful transition into this
   new epoch. Within local contexts, inclusive, democratic political
   processes facilitate complex and effective ecological solutions to
   social problems resulting from environmental change. Genuine
   incorporation of local knowledge into the decision-making process is
   critical to fostering this ecological democracy and building effective
   adaptation strategies. Coastal systems are important nexus points to
   investigate the relationship between environmental problems and social
   processes. Fisheries are a critical piece of coastal systems that
   sustain local communities and the larger economy. I provide a case study
   of local adaptation to ecological changes as the State of Louisiana
   attempts to protect vulnerable communities, infrastructure, and
   fisheries through coastal planning and management. Louisiana's fisheries
   are a critical asset that stand to be significantly impacted by
   continuing coastal erosion. Like the Anthropocene itself, Louisiana's
   coastal erosion crisis is largely the result of human intervention in
   the biosphere for social and economic purposes. The state's adaptive
   response is an ambitious master plan that seeks to rebuild the coast and
   protect its communities and economic interests. Although the plan is
   ambitious and generally lauded, I argue that the top-down approach the
   State of Louisiana uses in setting coastal priorities undercuts the
   plan's efficacy by struggling to incorporate local knowledge and
   establish a trusting relationship with coastal stakeholders. Without a
   genuinely deliberative process that bridges across scales and knowledge
   systems, the state will ultimately struggle to draw in local knowledge,
   inhibiting comanagement of local fisheries and potentially undermining
   the ecological solutions it aims to achieve.},

Abstract = {Global climate change is increasingly considered one of the major
   threats to tropical coastal fisheries, potentially undermining important
   revenue and food security provided by coral reef ecosystems. While there
   has been significant and increasing work on understanding specific
   effects of climate change on coral reef fishes, few studies have
   considered large-bodied fisheries target species, limiting understanding
   of the effects of climate change on tropical fisheries. This review
   focuses on coral grouper (Plectropomus spp., and mainly Plectropomus
   leopardus), which are heavily fished throughout the Indian and Pacific
   oceans, and represent an exemplar group to assess potential effects of
   climate change on coral reef fisheries. In experimental studies, P.
   leopardus appear to be extremely sensitive to increasing ocean
   temperature, exhibiting declines in survivorship, aerobic scope and
   activity with relatively moderate increases in temperature. As such,
   ongoing ocean warming may jeopardize the catchability of coral grouper
   and sustainability of reef-based fisheries, especially at low latitudes.
   Notably, a significant portion of wild stocks of P. leopardus are
   already exposed to temperatures (>= 30 degrees C) that have been shown
   to compromise individual performance and body condition. While there are
   considerable knowledge gaps in predicting effects of global climate
   change on coral grouper, such as their capacity to avoid, acclimate or
   adapt to changes in local environmental conditions, current information
   suggests that there is cause for concern. As such, we take the formative
   steps to outline both ecological and socioeconomic adaptations that
   could reduce vulnerability of coral reef fisheries to climate impacts on
   stocks of coral grouper, using a linked socio-economic framework.},

Abstract = {Trauma from natural disasters affects hurricane-impacted populations
   with accelerating frequency and often recurrently as a result of climate

   mitigate trauma to populations facing disaster and climate change risk,
   but the guidance itself may be met with mistrust due to historic and
   recurrent government failures to support traumatized, hurricane-affected
   communities. The aim of the Community Resilience Learning Collaborative
   and Research Network study is to address trauma and improve community
   resilience in response to disaster and climate change-related events in
   South Louisiana. Key informant interviews from 47 community-based
   organizations across New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Coastal Louisiana
   were analyzed and compared with the Key Messages of the 4th National
   Climate Assessment to determine efficient strategies for building
   resilience. Community-based organization interviewees emphasized the
   importance of organizing community-led coalitions and partnerships,
   implementing trauma-informed care in schools and health care settings,
   providing infrastructures and educational resources to navigate housing
   and financial barriers, and creating dialogue to better understand and
   accept climate change. The strategies revealed in the key informant
   interviews will be used to design the agency-level coalition-building

   the Capelinhos volcano on the island of Faial in 1957. Hence, the Azores
   offers the opportunity to assess insular risk awareness, facing both
   telluric and climate-related hazards. The key research question emerges
   from their natural situation: how does the local population perceive the
   threat of the natural hazards that occur in Azores? Because risks are
   socially constructed and depend on the uniqueness of territories, risk
   mitigation strategies must focus on the individual experiences of local
   dwellers, as a relationship between risk awareness and such strategies
   may be expected. To analyze this relationship, a web-based survey with a
   questionnaire including these variables was administered to a sample of
   Azoreans. The study aimed to assess risk awareness of the Azorean
   population and find a relationship between this and reported mitigation
   strategies. The results gave a preliminary insight into Azorean risk
   awareness of natural hazards and showed a significant positive
   relationship between risk awareness-raising activities and reported
   mitigation strategies. This is relevant information for municipalities
   and regional governments of areas with similar risk exposures, showing
   that, although risk awareness alone is not enough for measures to be
   implemented, it may be an important motivational first step for this to
   occur.},

Title = {Performance evaluation of CORDEX-South Asia simulations and future
   projections of northeast monsoon rainfall over south peninsular India},
Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {132},

Abstract = {The northeast monsoon (October-December; NEM) rainfall is a very
   important entity to about 250 million people residing in the South
   Peninsular India (SPI) region as it is their principle rainy season and
   contributes mostly to their annual rainfall. The aim of the study is to
   obtain the future projections of NEM rainfall over this region
   representing three different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (i.e.,
   RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for two future time slices, i.e., near
   (2020-2049) and far future (2070-2099) estimated from a set of
   high-resolution regional climate simulations performed under CORDEX-SA
   experiments. To achieve that, first, an assessment of ten CORDEX-SA
   regional climate model (RCM) simulations is done for NEM rainfall over
   SPI for present climate (1976-2005) against India Meteorological
   Department high resolution (0.25o x 0.25o) gridded rainfall analysis
   dataset. Then, the change in NEM rainfall over SPI in the near and far
   future is computed after applying standardized reconstruction technique
   to adjust the bias present in the models. The results suggest that most
   of the CORDEX-SA experiments are able to simulate the spatial
   distribution of NEM seasonal rainfall and its variability over SPI but
   there is an inability in capturing realistic magnitudes and the errors
   are more over the east and west coast where most of the rainfall occurs.
   The experiment with RCA4 driven by EC-EARTH global model and REMO2009
   driven by MPI-ESM has a fairly lesser bias than the other models,
   whereas the bias is more in LMDZ-IITM-RegCM4. The experiments by CCAM
   models have very similar characteristics in representing the rainfall
   pattern. The standardized reconstruction bias correction technique was
   found to significantly improve the performance of the climate models in
   representing the climatological mean and inter-annual variability of
   (IAV) of NEM rainfall over SPI, but in case of categorical rainfall
   years, improvement is seen only in the normal rainfall years. In the
   future, for RCP 2.6, there is a rise in NEM rainfall in the first half
   of the twenty-first century, which is projected to decline after that;
   however, in the other two scenarios, the rainfall is projected to
   increase. It is also found that there may be lesser excess rainfall
   years and more deficit rainfall years in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios
   in the near future, and no deficit rainfall years are projected in the
   far future in both these scenarios based on the present climate. It is
   also noticed that the variability in the NEM rainfall over this region
   may remarkably increase in all the three future scenarios, which will
   highly impact various water resources management sectors. Thus, this
   study is very useful in determining the effects on various sectors due
   to the variability in NEM rainfall over this region and for adapting to
   climate change using advanced technologies for a sustainable future.},

Title = {Nested pathways to adaptation},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Societies around the world have shown a strong capacity for responding
   to climatic and other stresses throughout history. Based on the large
   body of literature on adaptation to both climatic and other stresses,
   this paper examines the scalar interconnections and nested hierarchical
   nature of adaptation decision. Drawing on case studies from around the
   world, we propose three stages of nested adaptation: (a) coping with
   change, (b) incremental adjustment to manage risk, and (c) system
   transformation. The effectiveness of coping is often marginal but forms
   benchmarks against which future adaptation to climate change can be
   assessed. Incremental adaptations, largely associated with technological
   fixes, involve more exogenous actors and operate at a greater scale than
   coping. Transformational adaptation is expected to occur when the rate
   and magnitude of change threatens to overwhelm the system. Nested with
   multiple-scale spatial hierarchy, the three pathways to climate
   adaptation are interconnected; understanding the cross-scale
   interactions, feedback loops and the spatial and temporal dynamics
   within the hierarchy is important because it affects planning and policy
   integration, including allocation of financial resources.},

Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {5693-5705},
Abstract = {The future climate change information plays key role for planning
   adaptation and mitigation strategy. In this study, the combination of
   the widely employed statistical downscaling model (SDSM) and two CMIP5
   models, namely MPI-ESM-LR and CNRM-CM5, was used to generate the future
   projection of maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax and Tmin) under
   RCP8.5 and RCP 2.6 emission scenarios within a period of 2011 to 2100
   over the Haihe Basin. The historical ground observations (daily maximum
   and minimum temperature) during 1971 similar to 2000 was employed to
   calibrate the SDSM models. Results showed that:(1) The SDSM model had a
   good ability to reproduce the daily and monthly mean Tmax and Tmin in
   the basin; (2) For the historical reproduction of Tmax and Tmin, the
   performance of CNRM-CM5 was a little worse than that of MPI-ESM-LR. (3)
   The change in annual mean Tmax and Tmin under the two scenarios for all
   evaluation periods will increase and magnitude of Tmax will be higher
   than Tmin. (4) The increase in magnitude for the weather stations in the
   mountains and along the coastline will be remarkably obvious. (5) The
   future annual Tmax and Tmin will keep a significant upward trend under
   RCP8.5 scenarios over the whole projection period and the magnitude will
   be 0.37 degrees C and 0.39 degrees C per decade, respectively; the
   future annual Tmax and Tmin will increase in 2020s and then decrease in
   2050s and 2070s, and the magnitude will be 0.01 degrees C and 0.01
   degrees C per decade, respectively. The related results could provide an
   insight into the mitigation measure for adverse effect of future climate
   change on the regional ecological environment.},

Abstract = {This study examines the 1950-2017 temporal changes in climate extremes
   in Israel, which is located in the East Mediterranean (EM), a region
   which suffers from a scarcity of long and reliable datasets. It is well
   known that most long-term records are affected by artificial shifts most
   commonly caused by station relocation, instrumental modification and
   local environmental changes. Therefore, for the first time, a thorough
   homogenization (detection and correction) routine was developed and
   implemented in the long-term records. Consequently, a new daily adjusted
   dataset has been generated, including 34 temperature stations and 60
   precipitation stations. Based on this comprehensive dataset, 38 extreme
   indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and
   the Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices have been calculated.
   These indices will help various sectors to plan properly mitigation
   actions and adaptation for climate change, in addition to facilitating
   future studies for the EM. The results showed highly significant changes
   in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those
   indices derived from the daily minimum temperature (TN, 1950-2017),
   whereas the maximum temperature (TX) exhibited a similar increasing
   magnitude of the TN (0.55 degrees C/decade) in the last 30years. The
   warming trends, which are non-monotonic, seem to have been particularly
   strong since the early 1990s. The coastal area is characterized by
   higher heat stress during the nighttime, while mountains exhibit a
   strong tendency towards increasing temperatures during the noon hours. A
   reduction in the total precipitation amount and in the number of wet
   days with a tendency towards more intense wet days was found. Although
   all the regional trends of the precipitation indices were not
   statistically significant (p <= .05), they showed a fine spatial
   coherence.},

Abstract = {This study deals with the ``safer island concept{''} implemented for the
   reconstruction and rehabilitation works after the 26 December 2004
   Indian Ocean Tsunami in the Maldives. The safer island concept has been
   developed as an important adaptation strategy for tsunamis as well as
   the sea-level rise due to climate change. Reconstruction work in
   Dhuvaafaru Island to rehabilitate the entire population of Kandholhudhoo
   Island of Raa atoll is chosen as a case study. The appropriateness of
   the functionality of the redesigned island to provide security and
   safety for the island communities is evaluated using the digital
   elevation model.
   The study results show that the design enhanced mitigation measures of
   the island might show some resilience for less frequent natural
   disasters such as smaller tsunamis, while the implementation of the
   concept may create greater vulnerability for more frequent disasters,
   such as flash floods and storms. An integrated approach with appropriate
   risk assessment of floods, storms, and other physical aspects of the

Abstract = {The Sundarbans (West Bengal) is highly vulnerable to
   hydro-meteorological hazards such as coastal storm surges, flooding,
   cyclones and other climatic events. These events often lead to loss of
   productivity in ecosystem-based livelihoods, biodiversity, ecosystem
   goods and services. Communities directly dependent on socio-ecological
   systems for primary livelihood need to strengthen their resilience for
   early recovery and prepare for the impacts of future hazards. Current
   policies often assume that households are equally vulnerable to hazards.
   However, there is no robust empirical study available on the level and
   distribution of vulnerability amongst marginalised households. This
   study compared the levels of vulnerability amongst 500 households in
   five villages situated in the Mangrove ecosystem of the Indian Sundarban
   using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVIs). The results uncover
   significant variations in levels and distribution of vulnerability
   between the villages. These findings could be used to tailor need-based
   bespoke adaptation and mitigation interventions to combat
   climate-induced variability or hazard events in the future. In order to
   optimise the benefits of policy or program for strengthening resilience
   of these households - this article recommends that policymakers consider
   micro-level differences in levels and distribution of vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Assessment of the vulnerability of and expected socioeconomic losses
   over the Nile Delta coast due to the impact of sea level rise (SLR) was
   carried out in detail. Impacts of SLR on the Governorates of Alexandria
   and Port Said, in particular, were evaluated quantitatively. Options and
   costs of adaptation were analyzed and presented. Multi-criteria and
   decision matrix approaches based on questionnaire surveys were carried
   out to identify priorities in the 2 case studies. Results indicate that
   there are very limited possibilities of changing jobs for vulnerable
   stakeholders; cost is the main barrier of implementation; the majority
   of stakeholders recommend protection actions; and beach nourishment with
   limited hard structures (groins and breakwaters) is the best immediate
   option for adaptation, while the ICZM approach is the best available
   strategic option.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) poses a range of threats to natural and built
   environments in coastal zones around the world. Assessment of the risks
   due to exposure and sensitivity of coastal communities to coastal
   flooding is essential for informed decision-making. Strategies for
   public understanding and awareness of the tangible effects of climate
   change are fundamental in developing policy options. A
   multidisciplinary, multinational team of natural and social scientists
   from the USA, the UK, and Brazil developed the METROPOLE Project to
   evaluate how local governments may decide between adaptation options
   associated with SLR projections. METROPOLE developed a participatory
   approach in which public actors engage fully in defining the research
   problem and evaluating outcomes. Using a case study of the city of
   Santos, in Brazil, METROPOLE developed a method for evaluating risks
   jointly with the community, comparing `no-action' to `adaptation'
   scenarios. At the core of the analysis are estimates of economic costs
   of the impact of floods on urban real estate under SLR projections
   through 2050 and 2100. Results helped identify broad preferences and
   orientations in adaptation planning, which the community, including the
   Santos municipal government, co-developed in a joint effort with natural
   and social scientists.},

Title = {Adaptation for crop agriculture to climate change in Cameroon: Turning

Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The Cameroonian agricultural sector, a critical part of the local
   ecosystem, is potentially vulnerable to climate change raising concerns
   about food security in the country's future. Adaptations policies may be
   able to mitigate some of this vulnerability. This article investigates
   and addresses the issue of selected adaptation options within the
   context of Cameroonian food production. A methodology is applied where
   transient diagnostics of two atmosphere-ocean general circulation
   models, the NASA/Goddard Institute GISS and the British HadCM3, are
   coupled to a cropping system simulation model (CropSyst) to simulate
   current and future (2020, 2080) crop yields for selected key crops
   (bambara nut, groundnut, maize, sorghum, and soybean) in eight
   agricultural regions of Cameroon. Our results show that for the future,
   substantial yield increases are estimated for bambara groundnut, soybean
   and groundnut, while little or no change or even decreases for maize and
   sorghum yields, varying according to the climate scenario and the
   agricultural region investigated. Taking the ``no regrets{''} principle
   into consideration, we explore the advantages of specific adaptation
   strategies specifically for three crops viz. maize, sorghum and bambara
   groundnut, under GISS A2 and B2 marker scenarios only. Changing sowing
   dates may be ineffective in counteracting adverse climatic effects
   because of the narrow rainfall band that strictly determines the timing
   of farm operations in Cameroon. In contrast, the possibility of
   developing later maturing new cultivars proved to be extremely effective
   in offsetting adverse impacts, giving the highest increases in
   productivity under different scenario projections without management
   changes. For example, under climate change scenario GISS A2 2080, a
   14.6\% reduction in maize yield was converted to a 32.1\% increase; a
   39.9\% decrease in sorghum yield was converted to a 17.6\% increase, and
   for bambara groundnut (an under-researched and underutilised African
   legume), yields were almost trebled (37.1\% increase above that for
   sowing date alone (12.9\%)) due to increase length of growing period and
   the positive effects of higher CO2 concentrations. These results may
   better inform wider studies and development strategies on sustainable
   agriculture in the area by providing an indication as to the potential
   direction in shifts in production capabilities. Our approach highlights
   the benefit of using models as tools to investigate potential climate
   change impacts, where results can supplement existing knowledge. The
   results provide useful guidance and motivation to public authorities and
   development agencies interested in food security issues in Cameroon and
   elsewhere.},

Title = {Migration from atolls as climate change adaptation: Current practices,

Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Adaptive strategies are important for reducing the vulnerability of
   atoll communities to climate change and sea level rise in both the short
   and long term. This paper seeks to contribute to the emerging discourse
   on migration as a form of adaptation to climate change based on
   empirical studies in the two atoll communities, Reef Islands and Ontong
   Java, which are located in the periphery of Solomon Islands. The paper
   will outline current migration patterns in the two island groups and
   discuss how some of this migration may contribute to adaptation to
   climate change and other stresses. It shows that migration currently
   improves access to financial and social capital, reduces pressure on
   natural resources and makes island communities less vulnerable to
   extreme weather events and other shocks all factors that contribute
   positively to adaptive capacity. It also shows that there are major
   barriers to migration that reduce the efficacy of positive outcomes to
   both migrants and their home communities, including high transport costs
   and problems in gaining access to housing, employment and government
   services in urban destination areas. If it is accepted that voluntary
   migration may play a positive role in adaptation to climate change in
   exposed atoll communities, addressing some of the barriers to migration
   seems logical. This may be done by efforts to stimulate migrant income
   opportunities, by improving migrant living conditions and by improving
   the transport services to the islands.},

Abstract = {Recent accelerated climate change has exacerbated existing environmental

   of changes in land use, increasing pollution and declining biodiversity.
   For five broad and interconnected impact domains (water, ecosystems,
   food, health and security), current change and future scenarios
   consistently point to significant and increasing risks during the coming
   decades. Policies for the sustainable development of Mediterranean
   countries need to mitigate these risks and consider adaptation options,
   but currently lack adequate information - particularly for the most
   vulnerable southern Mediterranean societies, where fewer systematic
   observations schemes and impact models are based. A dedicated effort to
   synthesize existing scientific knowledge across disciplines is underway
   and aims to provide a better understanding of the combined risks posed.},

Title = {Introduction: Autochthonous human adaptation to biodiversity change in

Abstract = {Rapid biodiversity change that is already occurring across the globe is
   accelerating, with major and often negative consequences for human
   well-being. Biodiversity change is partly driven by climate change, but
   it has many other interacting drivers that are also driving human
   adaptation, including invasive species, land-use change, pollution and
   overexploitation. Humans are adapting to changes in well-being that are
   related with these biodiversity drivers and other forces and pressures.
   Adaptation, in turn, has feedbacks both for biodiversity change and
   human well-being; however, to date, these processes have received little
   science or policy attention. This Special Issue introduces human
   adaptation to biodiversity change as a science-policy issue. Research on
   human adaptation to biodiversity change requires new methods and tools
   as well as conceptual evolution, as social-ecological systems and
   environmental change adaptation approaches must be reconsidered when
   they are applied to different processes and contexts-where biodiversity
   change drivers are highly significant, where people are responding
   principally to changes in species, species communities and related
   ecosystem processes, and where adaptation entails changes in the
   management of biodiversity and related resource use regimes. The
   research was carried out in different marine and terrestrial
   environments across the globe. All of the studies consider adaptation
   among highly biodiversity-reliant populations, including Indigenous
   Peoples in the Americas and Europe, farmers in Asia and marine resource
   users in Europe and the Pacific. The concept of autochthonous adaptation
   is introduced to specifically address adaptation to environmental change
   in local systems, which also considers that local adaptation is
   conditioned by multi-scalar influences and occurs in synergy or conflict
   with adaptations of other non-local agents and actors who enable or
   constrain autochthonous adaptation options.},

Title = {BLUE MUSSEL (GENUS MYTILUS) TRANSCRIPTOME RESPONSE TO SIMULATED CLIMATE
   CHANGE IN THE GULF OF MAINE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The biogeochemistry of the Gulf of Maine (GOM) is rapidly changing in
   response to the changing climate, including rising temperatures,
   acidification, and declining primary productivity. These impacts are
   projected to worsen over the next 100 y and will apply selective
   pressure on populations of marine calcifiers. This study investigates
   the transcriptome expression response to these changes in ecologically
   and economically important marine calcifiers, blue mussels. Wild mussels
   (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus) were sampled from sites spanning
   the GOM and exposed to two different biogeochemical water conditions:
   (1) present-day conditions in the GOM and (2) simulated future
   conditions, which included elevated temperature, increased acidity, and
   decreased food supply. Patterns of gene expression were measured using
   RNA sequencing from 24 mussel samples and contrasted between ambient and
   future conditions. The net calcification rate, a trait predicted to be
   under climate-induced stress. was measured for each individual over a
   2-wk exposure period and used as a covariate along with gene expression
   patterns. Generalized linear models, with and without the calcification
   rate, were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts between
   ambient and future conditions. The comparison revealed transcripts that
   likely comprise a core stress response characterized by the induction of
   molecular chaperones, genes involved in aerobic metabolism, and
   indicators of cellular stress. Furthermore, the model contrasts revealed
   transcripts that may be associated with individual variation in
   calcification rate and suggest possible biological processes that may
   have downstream effects on calcification phenotypes, such as zinc-ion
   binding and protein degradation. Overall, these findings contribute to
   the understanding of blue mussel adaptive responses to imminent climate
   change and suggest metabolic pathways are resilient in variable
   environments.},

Title = {Consideration of coastal risk in the Irish spatial planning process},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {161-169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The vulnerability of coastal areas to associated hazards is increasing
   due to population growth, development pressure and climate change. It is
   incumbent on coastal governance regimes to address the vulnerability of
   coastal inhabitants to these hazards. This is especially so at the local
   level where development planning and control has a direct impact on the
   vulnerability of coastal communities. To reduce the vulnerability of
   coastal populations, risk mitigation and adaptation strategies need to
   be built into local spatial planning processes. Local government,
   however, operates within a complex hierarchal governance framework which
   may promote or limit particular actions. It is important, therefore, to
   understand how local coastal planning practices are shaped by national
   and supranational entities. Local governments also have to respond to
   the demands of local populations. Consequently, it is important to
   understand local populations' perceptions of coastal risk and its
   management. Adopting an in-depth study of coastal planning in County
   Mayo, Ireland, this paper evaluates: (a) how European and national
   policies and legislation shape coastal risk management at local level;
   (b) the incorporation of risk management strategies into local plans;
   and (c) local perception of coastal risks and risk management. Despite a
   strong steer from supranational and national legislation and policy,
   statutory local plans are found to be lacking in appropriate risk
   mitigation or adaptation strategies. Local residents appear to be lulled
   into a sense of complacency towards these risks because of the low level
   of attention afforded to them by the local planning authorities. To
   avoid potentially disastrous consequences for local residents and
   businesses, it is imperative that this situation is redressed urgently.
   Based on our analysis, we recommend: the development and implementation
   of a national ICZM strategy, supported by detailed local ICZM plans; and
   obliging local government to address known risks in their plans rather
   than defer them to project level decision making. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Climate change challenges cultural heritage management and preservation.
   Understanding the barriers that can impede preservation is of paramount
   importance, as is developing solutions that facilitate the planning and
   management of vulnerable cultural resources. Using online survey
   research, we elicited the opinions of diverse experts across
   southeastern United States, a region with cultural resources that are
   particularly vulnerable to flooding and erosion from storms and sea
   level rise. We asked experts to identify the greatest challenges facing
   cultural heritage policy and practice from coastal climate change
   threats, and to identify strategies and information needs to overcome
   those challenges. Using content analysis, we identified institutional,
   technical and financial barriers and needs. Findings revealed that the
   most salient barriers included the lack of processes and preservation
   guidelines for planning and implementing climate adaptation actions, as
   well as inadequate funding and limited knowledge about the intersection
   of climate change and cultural heritage. Experts perceived that
   principal needs to overcome identified barriers included increased
   research on climate adaptation strategies and impacts to cultural
   heritage characteristics from adaptation, as well as collaboration among
   diverse multi-level actors. This study can be used to set cultural
   heritage policy and research agendas at local, state, regional and
   national scales.},

Abstract = {While current rates of sea level rise and associated coastal flooding in
   the New York City region appear to be manageable by stakeholders
   responsible for communications, energy, transportation, and water
   infrastructure, projections for sea level rise and associated flooding
   in the future, especially those associated with rapid icemelt of the
   Greenland and West Antarctic Icesheets, may be outside the range of
   current capacity because extreme events might cause flooding beyond
   today's planning and preparedness regimes. This paper describes the
   comprehensive process, approach, and tools for adaptation developed by
   the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) in conjunction with the
   region's stakeholders who manage its critical infrastructure, much of
   which lies near the coast. It presents the adaptation framework and the
   sea-level rise and storm projections related to coastal risks developed
   through the stakeholder process. Climate change adaptation planning in
   New York City is characterized by a multi-jurisdictional
   stakeholder-scientist process, state-of-the-art scientific projections
   and mapping, and development of adaptation strategies based on a

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to estimate a recent trend in
   climate change and its impact on livelihood of community living in Nam
   Dinh province, Vietnam. Further, it aims to increase the government
   attention for adaptation measures by providing awareness of climate
   change and its negative impacts on livelihood.
   Design/methodology/approach For study purpose, cross-sectional and
   secondary data sets were used. The community perceptions about climate
   change were recorded by face-to-face interviews of 500 respondents from
   Nam Dinh province, Vietnam in April 2015 by using a well-structured
   questionnaire, whereas secondary data were collected from the
   statistical yearbook of General Statistics Office of Vietnam. To
   accomplish the study objectives, Cobb-Douglas production function and
   Likert scale were used to estimate the community perceptions of climate
   change and impact of climate change on livelihood, respectively.
   Findings Results depict that climate change negatively impacted on the
   productivity of rice and livestock. Particularly, frequently occurring
   of droughts, floods and salinity intrusion negatively impacted on rice
   productivity, while livestock productivity is decreased by frequent
   occurring of flood storms in study area. Originality/value The study
   results suggest a government support is essential to achieve sustainable
   livelihoods for coastal communities living in the Red River Delta,
   particularly some adaptation measures in the context of climate change
   are required in study area.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the challenge of knowledge co-production and the
   implications for learning and adapting in the context of a narwhal
   co-management in Nunavut, Canada. Knowledge co-production is the
   collaborative process of bringing a plurality of knowledge sources and
   types together to address a defined problem and build an integrated or
   systems-oriented understanding of that problem. The paper considers
   knowledge co-production by examining five interrelated dimensions:
   knowledge gathering, sharing, integration, interpretation, and
   application. Voices of hunters, community representatives, and managers
   engaged in co-management are highlighted to identify primary challenges
   and opportunities. The analysis reveals how compartmentalized views of
   knowledge continue to constrain adaptive and collaborative management.
   An understanding of knowledge co-production processes, however, may help
   to overcome the resilience of top-down management approaches. (C) 2010

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {178-186},
Abstract = {The City of Phoenix (Arizona, USA) developed a Tree and Shade Master
   Plan and a Cool Roofs initiative to ameliorate extreme heat during the
   summer months in their arid city. This study investigates the impact of
   the City's heat mitigation strategies on daytime microclimate for a
   pre-monsoon summer day under current climate conditions and two climate
   change scenarios. We assessed the cooling effect of trees and cool roofs
   in a Phoenix residential neighborhood using the microclimate model
   ENVI-met. First, using xeric landscaping as a base, we created eight
   tree planting scenarios (from 0\% canopy cover to 30\% canopy cover) for
   the neighborhood to characterize the relationship between canopy cover
   and daytime cooling benefit of trees. In a second set of simulations, we
   ran ENVI-met for nine combined tree planting and landscaping scenarios
   (mesic, oasis, and xeric) with regular roofs and cool roofs under
   current climate conditions and two climate change projections. For each
   of the 54 scenarios, we compared average neighborhood mid-afternoon air
   temperatures and assessed the benefits of each heat mitigation measure
   under current and projected climate conditions. Findings suggest that
   the relationship between percent canopy cover and air temperature
   reduction is linear, with 0.14 degrees C cooling per percent increase in
   tree cover for the neighborhood under investigation. An increase in tree
   canopy cover from the current 10\% to a targeted 25\% resulted in an
   average daytime cooling benefit of up to 2.0 degrees C in residential
   neighborhoods at the local scale. Cool roofs reduced neighborhood air
   temperatures by 0.3 degrees C when implemented on residential homes. The
   results from this city-specific mitigation project will inform messaging
   campaigns aimed at engaging the city decision makers, industry, and the
   public in the green building and urban forestry initiatives. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Microfibers, as emerging contaminants, pose a growing threat to the
   global environment. Microfiber pollution has been one of the hot
   research topics in environmental science. However, there is no consensus
   on microfiber definition from ecological and environmental perspectives.
   The underestimated sources, the distribution in the ocean and the
   atmosphere, the transport pathway, the potential human exposure, and
   mitigation strategies of microfibers from a global perspective have not
   been systemically discussed. So, we aim to discuss and analyze these
   concerns in this review. Firstly, the definition of microfiber
   pollutants from the ecological and environmental perspectives is
   proposed. Secondly, the largest source and some emerging sources of
   microfibers on the Earth have been explored. Thirdly, the distribution
   and transmission path of microfibers in the ocean and the atmosphere are
   discussed. Fourthly, the exposure path of microfibers to the human body
   is analyzed. Lastly, some applicable measures to control microfiber
   pollution are proposed from global environmental sustainable development
   perspectives.},

   long-term flood risk management strategies for London and Rotterdam},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1559-1579},
Abstract = {Resilience is held as a promising concept to produce a paradigm shift
   from traditional flood control to an integration of flood risk
   management and spatial planning. Central ideas to the resilience
   narrative are that nothing is certain except uncertainty itself' and
   adaptability' is key to governing the unknown'. However, this
   terminology is far from clear, yet increasingly used, which raises the
   question how it is made sense of in practice. To answer this question,
   we examine two long-term flood risk management strategies in the London
   and Rotterdam region with a policy framing perspective (i.e. the English
   Thames Estuary 2100 Plan and the Dutch Delta Programme). In both
   strategies, uncertainties are a key concern, leading to adaptive
   strategic plans. Reconstructing the framing processes shows that the
   English adopted a scientific pragmatism' frame and the Dutch a joint
   fact-finding' frame. While this led to different governance approaches,
   there are also striking parallels. Both cases use established methods
   such as scenario planning and monitoring to manage' uncertainties.
   Similarly to previous turns in flood risk management, the resilience
   narrative seems to be accommodated in a technical-rational way,
   resulting in policy strategies that are maintaining the status quo
   rather than bringing about a paradigm shift.},

Title = {Ecosystem Services Linking Social and Ecological Systems: River
   Brownification and the Response of Downstream Stakeholders},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The theoretical framework of ecosystem services and that of resilience
   thinking are combined in an empirical case study of a social-ecological
   system. In the River Helge a catchment in southern Sweden, a slow
   increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) results in brownification of
   the water with consequences on ecosystem services in the lower part of
   the catchment of concern by local resource managers. An assessment of
   ecosystem service delivery was conducted to (1) identify plausible
   drivers of brownification in the study site and assess future ecosystem
   service delivery for stakeholders in downstream areas. An analysis of
   the perspective of beneficiaries, using qualitative methods, was pursued
   to (2) evaluate the impacts of brownification on downstream
   stakeholders.
   Our analyses of drivers of brownification in combination with climate
   change projections suggests that Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve will experience extreme water flows much more frequently than
   the system is accustomed to today, and that these water flows will be
   highly affected by brownification. The combination of severe summer
   flooding and high water color constituted a new disturbance regime and
   thus requires new adaptive strategies by local stakeholders. A range of
   coping and adaptation strategies were displayed by the farmers but also
   a possible transformation strategy, i.e., abandonment of the seasonally
   flooded meadows. Because hay making and grazing are central components
   in the active management of the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve, to discontinue this practice would have system-wide
   ramifications for the Biosphere Reserve. The vulnerability of fishing in
   the culturally significant ``Eel Coast,{''} part of the downstream area,
   was also exposed.
   We argue that for environmental monitoring of slow changing variables to
   make sense to local stakeholders, clear links to ecosystem service
   benefits are required. The responsibility for this and thus for matching
   of social and ecological scales falls heavily on regional managers. We
   further argue that resilience of a social-ecological system can be
   estimated by observing and analyzing how local stakeholders respond to
   disturbances, i.e., by analyzing their response strategies.},

Abstract = {The city of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) is one of the fastest-growing
   cities in sub-Saharan Africa. The city faces periodic water shortages,
   during which water demand is hardly satisfied. Only one third of the
   households receives water directly from the public water supply and
   water needs relies increasingly on groundwater. The sectors that
   represent the key/central aspects of vulnerability for Dar es Salaam,
   are water supply, waste management, drainage, and health services. The
   Adapting to Climate Change in Coastal Dar es Salaam (ACC-DAR) project is
   a co-founded research project, granted by the European Union, leaded by
   the Sapienza, University of Rome, in cooperation with Ardhi University
   of Dar es Salaam. The project will enhance the adaption to Climate
   Change (CC) capacities of Dar's municipalities, by increasing their
   understanding of adaptation practices, and by developing methodologies
   for integrating adaptation activities into strategies and plans for
   Urban Development and Environment Management (UDEM) in unplanned and
   unserviced coastal settlements. This paper deals with the results
   obtained by the approach carried out in the aim of better manage

   and continues to change in all areas of the world, the question arises
   whether the effects that are noticeable in urban areas are
   ``homemade{''}, or whether some of them originate from global and
   regional scale climate changes. Identifying the locally induced changes
   of urban meteorological parameters is especially relevant for the
   development of adaptation and mitigation measures. This study aims to
   distinguish global and regional climate change signals from those
   induced by urban land cover. Therefore, it provides a compilation of
   observed and projected climate changes, as well as urban influences on
   important meteorological parameters. It is concluded that evidence for
   climate change signals is found predominantly in air temperature. The
   effect of urban land cover on local climate can be detected for several
   meteorological parameters, which are air and surface temperature,
   humidity, and wind. The meteorology of urban areas is a mixture of
   signals in which the influencing parameters cannot be isolated, but can
   be assessed qualitatively. Blending interactions between local effects
   and regional changes are likely to occur.},

Abstract = {A changing climate will inevitably impact on the natural environment,
   including agriculture. Anticipatory adaptation is necessary to minimise
   the negative impacts of climate change, to take advantage of
   opportunities, and to ensure that food and fibre production is
   maintained. More detailed information is required as to which adaptation
   measures will yield relatively greater social rates of return. Such
   information would help define an efficient adaptation agenda in the
   agricultural sector. This article identifies key adaptation strategies
   across England's agricultural sector, and applies cost-benefit analysis
   to these to determine their net present values, highlighting where the
   greatest returns can be made, and the role for policy. The results span
   a wide range, with some soil management activities indicating a negative
   NPV of 122 pound million over the course of this century, to a positive
   NPV of 3,279 pound million in the case of some livestock adaptations to
   heat stress. Animal disease surveillance and peatland restoration also
   generated high NPVs of 1,850 pound million and 1,840 pound million,
   respectively. Adaptations addressing crop disease, water storage
   measures and managed coastal realignment generated more modest values
   ranging from 1 pound million to 61 pound million. Direct comparison of
   the numbers is misleading however as some refer to the national level
   while others are site-specific. The analysis provides a basis for a
   discussion on priorties and planning for adaptation in the agricultural
   sector.},

Title = {Assessing hazards and disaster risk on the coast for Pacific small
   island developing States: the need for a data-driven approach},
Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE COASTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Small island developing States, such as those in the Pacific, are often
   prone to multiple hazards that have potential to result in disaster and
   / or restrict development. Hazard data can be limited in resolution or
   omitted in or near SIDS' coasts, but a growing and improved range of
   datasets are becoming available. Through an analysis of approximately
   100 policy documents on hazards and disaster risk management in Pacific
   island nations, we found: limited information on hazards and how they
   manifest to disasters at local levels, thus not fully connecting drivers
   and subsequent risk; at times a non-specific multi-hazard approach
   prompting the need to address more specific hazards; and restricted
   temporal and spatial scales of analysis that potentially limit
   continuity of actions where mitigation methods evolve. These limitations
   suggest that appropriate and timely high resolution hazard data is
   needed from the top-down to underpin the design and development of local
   disaster risk management plans, simultaneous to local, bottom-up
   knowledge and interpretation to bring the realities of such hazard data
   to life. Developing and ensuring openly available hazard data will
   enable island States to develop more robust, inclusive disaster risk
   management plans and mitigation policies, plus aid inter-island
   comparison for communal learning.},

   approach. A controlled field study in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
   evaluates the impact of nature-based solutions on near surface air

   infrastructure. A field campaign was undertaken over the course of two
   summers to measure the impact of green roofs, green walls, urban
   vegetation and forestry systems, and urban agriculture systems on near

   green infrastructure applications are beneficial in regulating near
   surface air temperature and are not limited to specific treatments.
   Widespread usage of green infrastructure could be a viable strategy to

Title = {Climate, ocean circulation, and sea level changes under stabilization
   and overshoot pathways to 1.5 K warming},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {817-828},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {The Paris Agreement has initiated a scientific debate on the role that
   carbon removal - or net negative emissions - might play in achieving
   less than 1.5 K of global mean surface warming by 2100. Here, we probe
   the sensitivity of a comprehensive Earth system model (GFDL-ESM2M) to
   three different atmospheric CO2 concentration pathways, two of which
   arrive at 1.5 K of warming in 2100 by very different pathways. We run
   five ensemble members of each of these simulations: (1) a standard
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5) scenario, which produces 2
   K of surface warming by 2100 in our model; (2) a ``stabilization{''}
   pathway in which atmospheric CO2 concentration never exceeds 440 ppm and
   the global mean temperature rise is approximately 1.5 K by 2100; and (3)
   an ``overshoot{''} pathway that passes through 2 K of warming at
   mid-century, before ramping down atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as if
   using carbon removal, to end at 1.5 K of warming at 2100. Although the
   global mean surface temperature change in response to the overshoot
   pathway is similar to the stabilization pathway in 2100, this similarity
   belies several important differences in other climate metrics, such as
   warming over land masses, the strength of the Atlantic Meridional
   Overturning Circulation (AMOC), ocean acidification, sea ice coverage,
   and the global mean sea level change and its regional expressions. In
   2100, the overshoot ensemble shows a greater global steric sea level
   rise and weaker AMOC mass transport than in the stabilization scenario,
   with both of these metrics close to the ensemble mean of RCP4.5. There
   is strong ocean surface cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean and Southern
   Ocean in response to overshoot forcing due to perturbations in the ocean
   circulation. Thus, overshoot forcing in this model reduces the rate of
   sea ice loss in the Labrador, Nordic, Ross, and Weddell seas relative to
   the stabilized pathway, suggesting a negative radiative feedback in
   response to the early rapid warming. Finally, the ocean perturbation in
   response to warming leads to strong pathway dependence of sea level rise
   in northern North American cities, with overshoot forcing producing up
   to 10 cm of additional sea level rise by 2100 relative to stabilization
   forcing.},

Abstract = {Millions of people in Sunderbans generate their livelihood and
   sustenance through fishing, honey collection, fuel wood and timber. The
   paper attempts to examine the issues of coastal poverty, food security
   as well as livelihood insecurity and the adaptation options that help to
   the resilience of climate change. The paper is based on field survey
   conducted in the villages of Sunderans in 2011. The study revealed that
   fishing and crab collection, honey collection are the important sources
   of livelihood. The fishing resources have been declining which leads to
   the insecurity of livelihoods of the fishing communities. The study has
   identified the key adaptations like dependency of money lenders, fishing
   and crab collection, formation of Self Help Groups, livestock rearing
   and migration. This paper has important policy implications for poverty,
   livelihood vulnerability and migration.},

Abstract = {With the expectation of adverse climate change impacts, some (often
   majority) Indigenous populations of the Pacific are expressing a
   preference to remain on Indigenous lands for cultural and spiritual
   reasons. In some cases, Indigenous people express preparedness to die on
   traditional territory rather than relocate, representing a new type of
   agency and resistance to dispossession. This is a prominent politics of
   place of relevance to emerging debates and decision-making around
   retreat and relocation. If climate change is experienced by populations
   as an existential threat to culture, identity and place-based
   connections, voluntary immobility can be an important adaptation
   strategy that helps to strengthen cultural and spiritual resilience
   among those facing the prospect of a lost homeland. This paper argues
   that voluntary immobility decisions need ethically robust and culturally
   appropriate policies and practices, particularly when a site is deemed
   by external experts to be no longer fit for human settlement. National
   governments, civil society groups, international organisations and
   donors will need to: engage in culturally meaningful dialogue with
   communities about relocation and immobility; respect, protect and fulfil
   the rights of `immobile' people and those on the move; and confirm that
   in situ adaptation options have been exhausted.},

Abstract = {Preparation for climate change and responding appropriately to extreme
   events and abrupt changes in the state and organisation of ecosystems,
   and their dependent societies, is aided by pre- testing of strategies
   and adaptation options. Simulation modeling can facilitate understanding
   of the underlying drivers and system responses as well as appropriate
   monitoring, and can assist in planning for both gradual and abrupt
   future change. Here we first present a framework to map the flows from
   changes in physical drivers impacting biological systems through to
   their impact on socio- economic systems. We then suggest actions that
   could be taken as a perturbation propagates through the system, and
   examine several modeling tools that are being used to road- test
   climate- smart management responses, strategies or to inform design of
   adaptation options. Through case study examples we focus on (1) the use
   of multispecies models to advance our ability to anticipate or deal with
   major ecosystem shifts, (2) illustrate how the outputs of models, such
   as seasonal forecast models, can be used to adaptively respond to
   changes, and (3) the use of management strategy evaluation (MSE) to
   account for uncertainties and test the performance of alternative marine
   monitoring and management strategies to detect and respond to ecological
   changes caused by climate change.
   Our examples illustrate that models need not be overly complex to be
   useful. For example, we show that an intermediate complexity modelling
   approach assists in understanding the underlying mechanisms (e.g.
   nonlinear changes in population parameters below critical prey
   thresholds may contribute to the responses of predators to changes in
   their prey) as well as in identifying early warning signals (e.g.
   increasing variance in population monitoring data may signal a
   forthcoming abrupt decline). Similarly, forecasting models can provide
   information on seasonal time scales, allowing proactive decision making
   by a range of users. Seasonal forecasting is already being used in
   Australia in a range of marine farming and fishing operations to reduce
   uncertainty and manage business risks. Species-specific habitat
   forecasts are also being used to assist fishers plan the timing of their
   harvest of wild fisheries such as southern bluefin tuna. These
   approaches may represent a useful stepping stone to improve decision
   making and industry resilience at longer timescales.
   Ecological simulations of the resilience of marine ecosystems can
   similarly inform managers on how to build resilience to future climate
   change, in order to prevent or mitigate potentially catastrophic shifts
   to alternative (often less productive) ecosystem states. Under a
   changing climate there are no historical analogs, and hence
   forward-looking strategies that are pre-tested against a broad range of
   plausible future outcomes are needed. MSE can be used to compare the
   performance of alternative future strategies, whilst taking into account
   the considerable uncertainty both in future climate variables, and their
   impacts. An example is presented of the use of MSE to integrate across
   biological and climate uncertainties, and test the performance and risks
   (biological, multispecies, economic) of alternative management
   strategies applied to the Torres Strait bechede- mer (sea cucumber)
   fishery. Spatial management approaches based on adaptive feedback
   performed best and substantially reduced risks under future changing
   climate and biological uncertainty, compared with status quo management.
   Finally, we describe recent advancements in modeling capability to
   extend considerations beyond the biophysical domain as part of a broader
   socio-ecological framework. Models are the only approach that can
   provide such insight in a rigorous, repeatable and transparent fashion.},

Title = {Documenting a Century of Coastline Change along Central California and
   Associated Challenges: From the Qualitative to the Quantitative},
Journal = {WATER},

Abstract = {Wave erosion has moved coastal cliffs and bluffs landward over the
   centuries. Now climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and the
   changes in wave action are accelerating coastline retreat around the
   world. Documenting the erosion of cliffed coasts and projecting the rate
   of coastline retreat under future SLR scenarios are more challenging
   than historical and future shoreline change studies along low-lying
   sandy beaches. The objective of this research was to study coastal
   erosion of the West Cliff Drive area in Santa Cruz along the Central
   California Coast and identify the challenges in coastline change
   analysis. We investigated the geological history, geomorphic
   differences, and documented cliff retreat to assess coastal erosion
   qualitatively. We also conducted a quantitative assessment of cliff
   retreat through extracting and analyzing the coastline position at three
   different times (1953, 1975, and 2018). The results showed that the
   total retreat of the West Cliff Drive coastline over 65 years ranges
   from 0.3 to 32 m, and the maximum cliff retreat rate was 0.5 m/year.
   Geometric errors, the complex profiles of coastal cliffs, and
   irregularities in the processes of coastal erosion, including the
   undercutting of the base of the cliff and formation of caves, were some
   of the identified challenges in documenting historical coastline
   retreat. These can each increase the uncertainty of calculated retreat
   rates. Reducing the uncertainties in retreat rates is an essential
   initial step in projecting cliff and bluff retreat under future SLR more
   accurately and in developing a practical adaptive management plan to
   cope with the impacts of coastline change along this highly populated
   edge.},

Title = {Exploring the Health Impacts of Climate Change in Subsistence Fishing
   Communities throughout Micronesia: A Narrative Review},
Journal = {WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {For many people living in low-income coastal communities, marine
   resources provide a crucial source of animal protein and are of major
   nutritional importance. However, because of various human-induced
   pressures, such as overfishing and poor resource management, marine
   resources are deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. Climate change
   effects this dynamic by contributing directly to marine resource
   deterioration and acting as an effect multiplier, worsening
   already-present problems in the systems. This deterioration threatens
   the viability of marine resources to support future food security
   demands and presents multiple health implications for coastal
   communities that rely upon these resources. This research used a
   narrative review to explore how the impacts of climate change are
   projected to impact human health and sustainable development throughout
   subsistence fishing communities. A case study approach focusing on the
   Pacific Ocean region of Micronesia was conducted to provide a practical
   indication of the future scenario applicable to other geographical
   regions across the globe. The results indicate that climate change is
   likely to exacerbate adverse health outcomes such as food insecurity,
   ciguatera fish poisoning, heatstroke, and mental health problems and
   that climate change may lead to the deterioration of traditional
   cultural practices. As the climate crisis is happening now and will be
   an issue extending into the foreseeable future, it is necessary to
   implement adaptation strategies, funding, and governance to limit global
   emissions, preserve marine resources, and support human well-being.
   Therefore, this research details adaptation strategies, such as
   diversifying fish catch and reviving traditional postharvest
   preservation methods, that may help communities adapt to climate change.},

Abstract = {Emerging literature on climate adaptation suggests the need for
   effective ways of engaging or activating communities and supporting
   community roles, coupled with whole-of-system approaches to
   understanding climate change and adaptation needs. We have developed and
   evaluated a participatory approach to elicit community and stakeholder
   understanding of climate change adaptation needs, and connect diverse
   community members and local office bearers towards potential action. The
   approach was trialed in a series of connected social-ecological systems
   along a transect from a rural area to the coast and islands of
   ecologically sensitive Moreton Bay in Queensland, Australia. We
   conducted `climate roundtables' in each of three areas along the
   transect, then a fourth roundtable reviewed and extended the results to
   the region as a whole. Influence diagrams produced through the process
   show how each climate variable forecast to affect this region (heat,
   storm, flood, sea-level rise, fire, drought) affects the natural
   environment, infrastructure, economic and social behaviour patterns, and
   psychosocial responses, and how sets of people, species and ecosystems
   are affected, and act, differentially. The participatory process proved
   effective as a way of building local empathy, a local knowledge base and
   empowering participants to join towards future climate adaptation
   action. Key principles are highlighted to assist in adapting the process

Abstract = {The development of fishing management modeling was motivated by the need
   to understand mechanisms governing production flows of marine reserves.
   Several bioeconomic models were built and their analyses helped to
   identify management measures adapted to specific objectives. The
   approach adopted in this work must interest both fishermen (economics
   aspect: represented in the model by a price dynamics) and ecologist
   (stock durability: represented in the model by stock dynamics). First,
   we analyze the biological and economic stabilizability of a
   non-autonomous model involving a time-varying price and where the
   control is the catch rate. Then we introduce two management measures:
   the total allowable catch quota (TAC) measure during a fishing period,
   and the biological rest period. We study the alternating problem between
   these two measures. Finally, we evaluate the optimal time for each
   period according to biological and economic parameters. (C) 2009

Title = {Climate Change Projections for Tanzania Based on High-Resolution
   Regional Climate Models From the Coordinated Regional Climate
   Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)-Africa},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change are predicted to compromise
   social-economic developments in developing countries. Adaptation is the
   only option to reduce the impacts. However, before starting determining
   adaptation strategies, it is important to conduct scientific research to
   understand possible pathways of future climate change under different
   emission scenarios. This is essential for having scientific facts that
   would guide the formulation of effective adaptation strategies. In this
   study, climate change projections for Tanzania is carried out using
   outputs of high resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the
   Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment program (CORDEX).
   Future (2011-2100) projections of daily rainfall, minimum and maximum
   temperatures under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP
   8.5 and RCP 4.5 are compared with baseline (1971-2000) simulations. The
   comparison is based on determining the departure of future climate
   during present (2011-2040), mid (2041-2070) and end (2071-2100)
   centuries from baseline (1971-2000) climate condition. Results reveal
   that there are likely to be an obvious increased minimum and maximum
   temperature trend over the entire country in three future periods
   (2011-2040), (2041-2070), and (2071-2100) under both emission scenarios
   RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. This is especially true for the western parts of
   the country, southwestern highlands and the eastern parts of Lake Nyasa
   where maximum temperatures are projected to be greater than 3.5 degrees
   C and in the range of 2 to 2.4 degrees C under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5
   emission scenarios respectively. The western sides of the Lake Victoria
   basin and parts of Northeastern highlands are likely to feature
   increased minimum temperatures in the range of 4.5 to 4.8 degrees C
   under RCP 8.5 emission scenario. The cold season:
   June-July-August-September (JJAS) is likely to become warmer than the
   warm season that starts from October and continue to April or May.
   During JJAS season, the country is likely to experience increased
   maximum temperature in the range of 1.7 to 2.4 degrees C and 2 to 4
   degrees C in mid (2041-2070) and end (2070-2100) centuries respectively.
   Rainfall over parts of northeastern highlands and Coastal regions is
   projected to increase in the range of 0.5 to 1 mm/day and 0.25 to 0.5
   mm/day under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively.
   However, the western regions, southwestern highlands and eastern side of
   Lake Nyasa are likely to experience decreased amount of rainfall in the
   range of 0.5 to 1mm/day under both RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission
   scenarios.},

Title = {Structured decision making as a proactive approach to dealing with sea

Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) projections along the coast of Florida present an
   enormous challenge for management and conservation over the long term.
   Decision makers need to recognize and adopt strategies to adapt to the
   potentially detrimental effects of SLR. Structured decision making (SDM)
   provides a rigorous framework for the management of natural resources.
   The aim of SDM is to identify decisions that are optimal with respect to
   management objectives and knowledge of the system. Most applications of
   SDM have assumed that the managed systems are governed by stationary
   processes. However, in the context of SLR it may be necessary to
   acknowledge that the processes underlying managed systems may be
   non-stationary, such that systems will be continuously changing.
   Therefore, SLR brings some unique considerations to the application of
   decision theory for natural resource management. In particular, SLR is
   expected to affect each of the components of SDM. For instance,
   management objectives may have to be reconsidered more frequently than
   under more stable conditions. The set of potential actions may also have
   to be adapted over time as conditions change. Models have to account for
   the non-stationarity of the modeled system processes. Each of the
   important sources of uncertainty in decision processes is expected to be
   exacerbated by SLR. We illustrate our ideas about adaptation of natural
   resource management to SLR by modeling a non-stationary system using a
   numerical example. We provide additional examples of an SDM approach for
   managing species that may be affected by SLR, with a focus on the
   endangered Florida manatee.},

Title = {Maturity Improvements in Flood Protection Asset Management across the
   North Sea Region},
Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {North Sea Region countries depend heavily on flood protection
   infrastructure, such as dikes, dams, sluices and flood gates. Knowledge
   on where, when and how much to invest to ensure functioning is of
   crucial importance for asset owners and operators. This requires asset
   management approaches that are adaptable, respond to feedback and
   function within various contexts. The FAIR (Flood defense infrastructure
   Asset management \& Investment in Renovation, adaptation, optimisation
   and maintenance) project has developed a unique framework to ensure that
   asset management processes are adaptive, comprehensive and make
   effective connections across strategic, tactical and operational
   contexts. The framework has for the first time informed an assessment of
   maturity of five flood protection asset management organisations in the
   North Sea Region, using a seven-factor maturity assessment model. This
   paper describes the self-assessment process and the self-reported
   maturity changes during the project. Maturity assessments were
   undertaken on two occasions, at the start of the project, and again
   toward the end. This has revealed how the baseline level of maturity for
   each organisation developed over the course of the three-year project.
   The observed maturity changes indicate that adopting the FAIR framework
   has added value in improving current approaches to asset management.},

Title = {Coastal flood risks in China through the 21st century - An application
   of DIVA},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {704},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {China experiences frequent coastal flooding, with nearly US\$ 77 billion
   of direct economic losses and over 7,000 fatalities reported from 1989
   to 2014. Flood damages are likely to grow due to climate change induced
   sea-level rise and increasing exposure if no further adaptation measures
   are taken. This paper quantifies potential damage and adaptation costs
   of coastal flooding in China over the 21st Century, including the
   effects of sea-level rise. It develops and utilises a new, detailed
   coastal database of China developed within the Dynamic Interactive
   Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) model framework. The refined database
   provides a more realistic spatial representation of coasts, with more
   than 2700 coastal segments, covering 28,966 km of coastline. Over 50\%
   of China's coast is artificial, representing defended coast and/or
   claimed land. Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs for China are
   assessed for different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and
   Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) combinations representing climate
   change and socio-economic change and two adaptation strategies: no
   upgrade of currently existing defences and maintaining current
   protection levels. By 2100, 0.7-20.0 million people may be flooded/yr
   and US\$ 67-3,308 billion damages/yr are projected without upgrade to
   defences. In contrast, maintaining the current protection level would
   reduce those numbers to 0.2-0.4 million people flooded/yr and US\$ 22-60
   billion/yr flood costs by 2100, with protection investment costs of US\$
   8-17 billion/yr. In 2100, maintaining current protection levels, dikes
   costs are two orders of magnitude smaller than flood costs across all
   scenarios, even without accounting for indirect damages. This research
   improves on earlier national assessments of China by generating a wider
   range of projections, based on improved datasets. The information
   delivered in this study will help governments, policy-makers, insurance
   companies and local communities in China understand risks and design
   appropriate strategies to adapt to increasing coastal flood risk in an
   uncertain world. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Seabirds scavenge baits from the hooks of commercial longline gear
   resulting in bait loss and seabird mortality. This interaction may cause
   decline in seabird populations and seriously reduce efficiency of
   fishing gear. Various mitigation measures capable of reducing the
   likelihood of seabird incidental catches have been proposed and
   described, but only a few studies have been conducted to quantify their
   effectiveness. An experiment to quantify seabird bycatch and bait loss
   caused by seabirds was carried out in the course of commercial
   longlining. Data were obtained from longlines set using three different
   mitigation measures and compared with those of longlines set without
   such measures. Potential increases in catches of target fish by using
   such measures were also quantified. The three measures tested included
   two different types of bird-scaring line (lines with suspended streamers
   that are towed astern during setting) and an underwater setting funnel.
   In the course of 11 settings for each of these methods, zero and two
   seabirds respectively were caught using one or the other of the
   bird-scaring lines, and six with the setting funnel, compared with 74
   birds when no device was used. The experiment demonstrated reduced bait
   loss and increased catch rates of target species in settings where
   either mitigation measure was employed. Increased catch rates were most
   pronounced for lines that were set using one of the bird-scaring lines.},

Abstract = {Commentary: Throughout New Zealand's history, the nation has maintained
   a close and privileged relationship with its island neighbours in the
   South Pacific, exemplified by centuries of trade and migration. As the
   effects of climate change encroach on South Pacific nations such as the
   Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, New Zealand has implemented an aid
   programme via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in order to
   mitigate the effects of the changing climate on these countries
   economically and socially. However, research depicts an aid programme
   that may do harm alongside good-by prioritising climate change
   mitigation over more sustainable and community-centred strategies, New
   Zealand has created a situation in which these countries become
   dependent on our solutions to their problems. By researching the
   controversial record of climate adaptation and mitigation strategies
   funded by developed nations across the South Pacific, it becomes evident
   that New Zealand's programme of climate aid in the region is neocolonial
   and unsustainable.},

Abstract = {Adaptation is a key concept in long-term human adjustments to climate
   change. Despite the centrality of human decisions and actions in
   adaptation, much of the climate change literature is thin on humanities
   and social science which are the primary approaches for understanding
   human activity. This situation is particularly pronounced in Louisiana's
   discussions about its disappearing coast line where research has
   concentrated in understanding biophysical processes and solutions
   prioritize short-term adaptations. This paper reviews the relationship
   of adaptation and long-term transitions in the global change discussion
   and traces how disjointed adaptations in coastal Louisiana have
   contributed to a perilous environmental situation there. It proposes a
   shift from discrete adaptations to efforts that incorporate interrelated
   biophysical and human adaptations that can sustain long-term
   transitions.},

Abstract = {Cost effectiveness of CO2 sequestration, especially into aquifers,
   strongly depends on the sequestration capacities and the routes to
   connect CO2 sequestration sites and recovery sites. This site dependency
   of CO2 sequestration makes its evaluation difficult. In order to
   evaluate the cost effectiveness of CO2 sequestration in parallel with
   other carbon mitigation options in Japan, a new mathematical model of
   optimization type has been developed. The energy systems and the
   processes of CO2 recovery, transportation and sequestration are modeled
   in the bottom-up fashion. To pay due consideration to the site
   dependency, the land area of Japan is divided into 20 regions and the
   offshore area also into 20 regions. The land regions have various kinds
   of energy supply-side facilities and CO2 recovery and transportation
   facilities. The final energy demand is grouped into four types of
   energy: solid fuel, gaseous fuel, liquid fuel and electricity. On the
   other hand, the offshore regions have aquifers for CO2 sequestration. In
   addition, CO2 sequestration into ocean is taken into account. These
   model regions are inter-linked with each other, and inter-regional CO2
   transportation and energy transportation are considered. The total cost
   of energy systems and CO2 sequestration in Japan between the years 2000
   and 2050 is minimized in this model. This paper describes the structure
   of this new model for evaluation of CO2 sequestration in Japan, and
   presents model-based optimization solutions as to when, where and how
   much CO2 sequestration and other carbon mitigation options should be
   implemented under assumed carbon mitigation policy options. (C) 2004

Abstract = {Global warming and climate change processes are expected to raise sea
   levels. This paper represents a contribution to the efforts of
   investigating the impact of sea level rise (SLR) on the Nile delta
   coastal zone and identifies anticipatory and adaptation measures that
   may be appropriate today in spite of current SLR uncertainties. SLR was
   calculated by applying the quadratic equation for 10-year intervals
   using 1980 as the base year. Despite large variation between SLR
   predictions, the results indicated that SLR is accelerating, with
   estimated value for the present (21st) century in the order of 0.6 m,
   although with a margin of as much as +/- 0.4 m. Local land subsidence in
   the Nile delta would exacerbate the impacts of rising seas. It was
   estimated that with a 1.0m SLR, about 4500 square kilometers
   representing 19\% of the delta area will be submerged and that 6.1
   million people will be affected. These potential impacts of SLR would be
   serious but manageable if appropriate actions are taken. The following
   adaptation measures to the impact of SLR in the Nile delta coastal zone
   were identified: maintaining and building coastal protection structures,
   restoration of sand dunes along the shore, preserving existing wetlands,
   setting regulations to control development in vulnerable areas, change
   of land use, relocation of infrastructures in the landward side, and
   development of comprehensive monitoring and early warning systems.},

Title = {Flow assurance issues in deep-water gas well testing and mitigation
   strategies with respect to gas hydrates deposition in flowlines-A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {318},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Gas hydrate formation and deposition in deepwater subsea flowlines has
   been a major concern to flow assurance engineers as oil and gas
   exploration moves towards offshore developments in deeper water and may
   cause operational safety hazards in subsea and cold regions. This
   challenge can be addressed through adequate knowledge of the mechanisms
   of formation and deposition of hydrates as well as predictive tools for
   their deposition in flowlines. This paper reviews various predictive
   models to study hydrate formation and deposition mechanisms based on the
   current publications on the gas-dominated flowloop investigations. The
   review also provides an overview of various gas hydrate mitigation and
   management strategies used in offshore production system. Important
   methods such as chemical injection and depressurization that have been
   used for mitigating hydrate formation are reviewed in this paper. These
   mitigation strategies assist in avoiding any form of casualties/hazards
   and ensure safe production operations. This review suggests that the
   management of gas hydrate risk in flowlines is the best solution to
   maintaining hazard-free operations, prevent causes of the loss of
   production and derive economic benefits from the use of huge deposits of
   natural gas hydrate as a source of methane gas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Urbanization effects on temperature trends of Lahore during 1950-2007},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274+},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the trends of changing
   temperature of Lahore in Pakistan due to invigorating urbanization
   process since 1950-2007.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research is designed by using the
   numerical time series data of mean minimum temperature (MMiT), mean
   maximum temperature (MMxT) and mean annual temperature (MAT). The growth
   in urban population, area and transportation are also evaluated by using
   the available data. Linear regression method is applied to investigate
   the results of change in temperature. Three different approaches to
   examine the MAT are testified; first as an entire period (1950-2007),
   and then by dividing the entire period into two equal phases as Phase I
   (1950-1974) and Phase II (1975-2207). MMiT and MMxT are analysed for the
   entire period without making any division.
   Findings - The results of the paper are significantly indicating an
   increase in MAT and MMiT which have risen up to 0.89 and 2.51 degrees C,
   respectively, while MMxT remained resolute throughout the study period.
   Change in MMiT is observed regular and brisk than other parameters of
   temperature. Increase in temperature in Phase I is observed only 0.062
   degrees C and in Phase II it is observed 0.94 degrees C.
   Research limitations/implications - This research can be further worked
   out by using different meteorological models to study the effects of
   urbanization on lower surface atmosphere and urban heat island effects
   in Lahore.
   Originality/value - By taking into consideration these results, the town
   planners and government can make different strategies to mitigate the
   urban effects on rising temperature in Pakistan.},

Title = {Indigenous food harvesting as social-ecological monitoring: A case study

Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1085-1099},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Indigenous peoples have been monitoring and managing the natural
   resources in their homelands and waters for millennia. Meanwhile,
   social-ecological systems thinkers are embracing the capacity of
   Indigenous knowledge systems, which are informed by land-based
   practices, to inform adaptive management.
   2. Following the collaborative design of a community-based
   social-ecological monitoring system over two traditional seafood
   harvesting seasons, we conducted a conceptual framework analysis of
   meeting notes and interview transcripts with Gitga'at harvesters and
   knowledge holders to discern how Gitga'at people monitor their territory
   and what indicators they focus on.
   3. An interconnected set of social-ecological concepts and indicators
   emerged, evidencing an intrinsic part of Gitga'at life: Gitga'at
   harvesters closely monitor their coastal social-ecological system
   through ongoing land- and sea-based practices.
   4. The conceptual framework highlights the importance of maintaining and
   revitalizing Indigenous knowledge and harvesting practices to inform
   social-ecological monitoring and adaptive management at local and
   broader scales.
   5. Amidst discussions of marine and coastal resource co-management in
   British Columbia, our results also suggest opportunities for scientific
   approaches to situate themselves within and support existing Indigenous
   frameworks and priorities.
   6. This research also adds to the discussion on the development of
   appropriate regional and global indicators and frameworks to monitor the
   resilience of social-ecological systems.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to modify ecological responses in the ocean,
   with the potential for important effects on the ecosystem services
   provided to humankind. Here we address the question of how rapidly
   multiple drivers of marine ecosystem change develop in the future ocean.
   By analysing an ensemble of models we find that, within the next 15
   years, the climate change-driven trends in multiple ecosystem drivers
   emerge from the background of natural variability in 55\% of the ocean
   and propagate rapidly to encompass 86\% of the ocean by 2050 under a
   `business-as-usual' scenario. However, we also demonstrate that the
   exposure of marine ecosystems to climate change-induced stress can be
   drastically reduced via climate mitigation measures; with mitigation,
   the proportion of ocean susceptible to multiple drivers within the next
   15 years is reduced to 34\%. Mitigation slows the pace at which multiple
   drivers emerge, allowing an additional 20 years for adaptation in marine
   ecological and socioeconomic systems alike.},

Abstract = {This study provides guidelines for strategic management in industrial
   oil plants linked to uncertainties of climate change through the
   development of integrated planning methodology with focus on coastal
   flooding events caused by relative sea level rise (RSLR). The research
   site is in Redonda Island, located in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro
   City, Brazil, and since 1960, it constitutes an industrial oil plant
   facility. The region suffers interaction with storms and meteorological
   tides from extratropical cyclones over the South Atlantic Ocean, being
   vulnerable to risks of disasters, floods, and coastal erosion. A Program
   on Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments to Relative Sea Level Rise
   ({''}Programa de Avalia double dagger o e Adapta double dagger o A s
   Vulnerabilidades de Eleva double dagger o do Nivel Relativo do
   Mar-PAAVENRM{''}) was developed to avoid compromising the regional and
   local development in the industrial system of the island, which is an ad
   hoc instrument designed to anticipate and reduce risks, damages, and
   losses by occurrence of extreme climatic events in coastal areas prone
   to flooding caused by RSLR. Results from computer simulation modeling
   indicate 37 prospective qualitative scenarios that consolidate the
   conditions of future climate vulnerability of the plant, starting from
   United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   information for RSLR up to 2100. Three quantitative forecasting
   scenarios were simulated, under boundary conditions preset for different
   altimetric ranges subject to submersion, based upon ordinary and
   extraordinary tides measured in the area in relation to RSLR, which
   allowed the evaluation of the industrial infrastructure at risk.
   Furthermore, three thematic maps were elaborated for the planning of
   specific coastal protection interventions. Percentages of physical
   damage and property losses were estimated. The importance of applying
   guidelines for medium and long-term corporate strategy management,
   integrating the risk of flooding, the rigging of civil defense systems,
   meteorology, and of the plans, programs, and existing systems and others
   to be developed is highlighted. From this perspective, the proposed
   scenarios help to identify the most relevant alternatives for mitigation
   and adaptation under technical criteria for decision making in the study
   area.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of the implications of extreme climate
   change requires an in-depth exploration of the perceptions and reactions
   of the affected stakeholder groups and the lay public. The project on
   ``Atlantic sea level rise: Adaptation to imaginable worst-case climate
   change{''} (Atlantis) has studied one such case, the collapse of the
   West Antarctic Ice Sheet and a subsequent 5-6 m sea-level rise. Possible
   methods are presented for assessing the societal consequences of impacts
   and adaptation options in selected European regions by involving
   representatives of pertinent stakeholders. Results of a comprehensive
   review of participatory integrated assessment methods with a view to
   their applicability in climate impact studies are summarized including
   Simulation-Gaming techniques, the Policy Exercise method, and the Focus
   Group technique. Succinct presentations of these three methods are
   provided together with short summaries of relevant earlier applications
   to gain insights into the possible design options. Building on these
   insights, four basic versions of design procedures suitable for use in
   the Atlantis project are presented. They draw on design elements of
   several methods and combine them to fit the characteristics and fulfill
   the needs of addressing the problem of extreme sea-level rise. The
   selected participatory techniques and the procedure designs might well
   be useful in other studies assessing climate change impacts and
   exploring adaptation options.},

   B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {78},

Pages = {105-116},
Abstract = {Recent results continue to indicate ozone depletion-related increases in
   solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280 - 315 nm) reaching the Earth's
   surface. Harmful doses of UV-B radiation can penetrate deep (up to
   several dozen meters) into the water column and may thus affect aquatic
   ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are key components of the Earth's
   biosphere since they produce more than 50 \% of the biomass on our
   planet. Phytoplankton and macroalgae are the major biomass producers and
   form the basis of the aquatic food webs. The highly energetic UV-B has
   the greatest potential for cell damage caused by both direct effects on
   DNA and proteins and indirect effects via the production of reactive
   oxygen species. UV-B can cause wide ranging damage such as reduction in
   development and reproduction resulting in loss of productivity of
   phytoplankton and macroalgae. Consequences of loss of productivity are
   reduced sink capacity for atmospheric CO2 and negative effects on
   species diversity, ecosystem stability, trophic interactions and
   ultimately biogeochemical cycles. However, a number of species have
   developed various adaptation strategies to counteract the-damaging
   effects of UV-B. These strategies include vertical migration within the
   water column, repair of DNA damage and production of
   UV-absorbing/screening mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). This article
   deals with the effects of UV-B radiation on phytoplankton and macroalgae
   and the adaptation strategies applied by them to reduce the negative
   effects of UV-B.},

Title = {Continental Portuguese Territory Flood Social Susceptibility Index},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1921-1931},
Abstract = {The combination of human exposure, extreme weather events and lack of
   adaptation strategies to cope with flood-related impacts can potentially
   increase losses not only on infrastructure but also on human lives.
   These impacts are usually difficult to quantify due to the lack of data,
   and for this reason most of the studies developed at the national scale
   only include the main characteristics that define the societal or
   individual predisposition to be affected, resist, adapt or recover, when
   exposed to a flood.
   The main objective of this work was to develop a flood social
   susceptibility index for the continental Portuguese territory based on
   the most representative variables able to characterize different
   influencing factors. This index is a component of the national
   vulnerability index developed in the scope of Flood Maps in Climate
   Change Scenarios (CIRAC) project, supported by the Portuguese
   Association of Insurers (APS).
   The main results showed that the proposed index correctly identified
   populations less prepared to avoid flood effects or able to cope with
   them, mostly concentrated in rural inland areas with lower income and
   education levels when compared with the coastal region between Viana do
   Castelo and Setubal.},

Title = {Local collective action: Adaptation to coastal erosion in the Monkey
   River Village, Belize},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {96-107},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Successful adaptation to environmental change and variability is closely
   connected with social groups' ability to act collectively, but many
   social-ecological challenges exceed local adaptive capacity which
   necessitate assistance from governmental institutions. Few studies have
   investigated how local collective action can be used to enrol external
   support for adaptation. This paper reduces this research gap by
   analysing a locally driven adaptation process in response to coastal
   erosion in Monkey River Village, Belize. Drawing on literature on
   adaptation and political ecology, we examine the different strategies Me
   local residents have used over time to influence government authorities
   to support them in curbing the coastal erosion. Our findings show that
   the local mobilisation generated government support for a temporary sea
   defence and that collective strategies emerge as a response to threats
   to a place specific way of life. Our case illustrates that it was
   essential that the villagers could ally with journalists, researchers
   and local NGOs to make their claims for protection heard by the
   government. The paper contributes to adaptation research by arguing that
   local collective action, seen as contestation over rights to protection
   from environmental change, can be a means for places and communities not
   prioritised by formal policies to enrol external support for adaptation.
   Our study supports and adds to the perspective that attention to formal
   arrangements such as adaptation policy alone has limited explanatory
   power to understand collective responses to change. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {287-294},

Abstract = {There is growing recognition of the need to improve protection against
   the adverse health effects of hot weather in the context of climate
   change. We quantify the impact of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and
   selected adaptation measures made to dwellings on temperature exposure
   and mortality in the West Midlands region of the UK. We used 1) building
   physics models to assess indoor temperatures, initially in the existing
   housing stock and then following adaptation measures (energy efficiency
   building fabric upgrades and/or window shutters), of representative
   dwelling archetypes using data from the English Housing Survey (EHS),
   and 2) modelled UHI effect on outdoor temperatures. The ages of
   residents were combined with evidence on the heat-mortality relationship
   to estimate mortality risk and to quantify population-level changes in
   risk following adaptations to reduce summertime heat exposure. Results
   indicate that the UHI effect accounts for an estimated 21\% of
   mortality. External shutters may reduce heat-related mortality by
   30-60\% depending on weather conditions, while shutters in conjunction
   with energy-efficient retrofitting may reduce risk by up to 52\%. The
   use of shutters appears to be one of the most effective measures
   providing protection against heat-related mortality during periods of
   high summer temperatures, although their effectiveness may be limited
   under extreme temperatures. Energy efficiency adaptations to the
   dwellings and measures to increase green space in the urban environment

Title = {Assessing inundation damage and timing of adaptation: sea level rise and

Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Climate change exacerbates the public policy challenges already present
   in managing contested landscapes. Coastal managers deal with multiple
   stressors and multiple stakeholders and have a difficult challenge in
   managing competing land use as sea level rise (SLR) reduces the amount
   of prized coastal land. The information needed to inform on the type and
   timing of adaptation strategies reflects a major gap in the planning and
   implementation of adaptation options. We present here an inundation risk
   assessment framework (IRAF) for estimating the impacts of increasing SLR
   inundation extent probabilities and the cost of inundation damage
   through time for public and private infrastructure assets. The framework
   integrates the cost of damage across asset classes in order to help
   decision-makers judge the economic utility of various adaptation options
   and the timing of implementation. We provide an example of this
   methodology using a case study from Southeast Australia in a low lying
   estuarine region with an increasingly urbanized population. The
   methodology shows a clear pathway in which to integrate multiple asset
   classes into a temporally based damage cost analysis. Such methodology
   will help address the timing of adaptation and allow for the development
   of trigger points to guide adaptation planning. Thus, the framework
   developed in this paper can be easily transferred to other regions and
   countries facing the same types of SLR risks. As SLR and inundation
   encroachment continue to occur, decisions regarding protection, repair,
   and retreat will be made depending on the resources available to local
   governments. The challenge is to balance decision making with both the
   timing of implementation as well as costs (both of action and inaction).
   By understanding the areas of land lost to inundation and the cost of
   inaction through time, local governments can assess the rationality of
   adaptation at points in the present and future.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses a serious threat to sea turtles (Cheloniidae) as
   their terrestrial reproductive phase is only successful within a limited
   range of environmental and physical conditions. These conditions are
   likely to become less optimal as climate change progresses. To date,
   management and conservation of sea turtles has focused almost entirely
   on non-climatic stressors, due at least in part to practitioners not
   knowing what strategies to take and the feasibility and risks of
   potential strategies. To aid the management of sea turtles in a changing
   environment, we identified management strategies via a focus workshop
   and surveys to mitigate the impacts of climate change to the terrestrial
   reproductive phase of sea turtles. The effectiveness, ecological risks
   and potential social and logistical constraints associated with
   implementing each of the identified management strategies is discussed.
   Twenty management strategies were identified; strategies varied from
   habitat protection to more active and direct manipulation of nests and
   the nesting environment. Based on our results, we suggest a
   three-pronged approach to sea turtle conservation in light of climate
   change, where managers and researchers should: 1) enhance sea turtle
   resilience to climate change by mitigating other threats; 2) prioritise
   implementing the `no regret' and `reversible' management strategies
   identified here; and 3) fill the knowledge gaps identified to aid the
   trial and implementation of the potential strategies identified here. By
   combining these three approaches our collective toolkit of sea turtle
   management strategies will expand, giving us an array of viable
   approaches to implement as climate change impacts become more extreme.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the geo-engineering approach to tackling climate
   change. The failure of the 15(th) United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP15) to obtain a legally
   binding emissions reduction agreement makes the deployment of
   geo-engineering solutions an increasingly attractive proposition. This
   review looks at a variety of global and local approaches to
   geo-engineering covering solar radiation management and carbon cycle
   engineering and attempts to assess the feasibility of the technologies
   from an engineering perspective. However, despite the plethora of ideas
   generated by the science community, it still appears that much work
   remains to be done in the initial engineering assessment of these
   techniques and this is a major hurdle to overcome before any
   geo-engineering scheme can be fully considered. Hence, the paper
   concludes by calling for the instigation of national and international
   programmes of research at the feasibility level, to inform discussions
   regarding future possible deployment of small scale, local
   geo-engineering and adaptation measures. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {The number of hot days is increasing in many parts of the world because
   of the heat island phenomenon and global climate change. High air
   temperature greatly affects human thermal comfort and public health,
   particularly in urban areas. Therefore, the challenging task of, urban
   designers and urban planners in accommodating the increasing population
   is to make cities with the least level of vulnerability to future
   climate change. Interest in transferring urban climatic knowledge into
   urban planning practices, and developing mitigation strategies to adapt
   to climate change, has been increased in recent years. The use of
   vegetation and appropriate urban geometry are shown very promising in
   mitigating the adverse effects of heat island and providing a better
   pedestrian thermal comfort. This article reviews studies on pedestrian
   level urban greening and geometry in improving thermal comfort in
   cities. Such strategies can be applied at the preliminary stages of
   urban planning and thus directly affect the microclimate. The analyzed
   data include simulation and field measurement studies. The discussion of
   this research clearly reflects how urban design guidelines can be
   applied to enhance outdoor thermal comfort and minimize the heat island
   effect. This study is helpful in controlling the consequences of city
   design from the early design stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {For operational use there is a need to identify a set of measures that
   quantify the resilience. The `CoastRes' project, a component of the UK
   Climate Resilience Programme, examined how an operational interpretation
   of resilience might be applied to the coast, building on existing
   approaches to shoreline management in the UK. The development of the
   methodology and resulting Coastal Resilience Model has been reported
   elsewhere. For this communication, we provide a brief summary of the
   management framework, the Coastal Resilience Model (CRM) and the
   preparation of the datasets, so that the limitations of the data
   available at a national scale are clear. We then illustrate how the
   Coastal Resilience Model has been implemented as the web-based CRM
   Portal. The purpose of the portal is to allow users to explore (i) the
   implications of future change on local and national resilience; and (ii)
   their own view of the relative importance of the Performance Measures
   that make up the Coastal Resilience Index. By exploring the influence of
   these weightings it is hoped that Stakeholders can develop a shared
   understanding of what is important for coastal communities. The CRM

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to exacerbate damage to agricultural
   production from natural disasters. Examination of measures to adapt to
   the damage represents an urgent matter for agriculture. A
   multidisciplinary research project aimed at providing effective
   information related to development a weather index insurance (WII)
   system was conducted for rice farmers in a coastal region of Myanmar to
   achieve sustainable rice farm management in the country, which is among
   the world's poorest and most disaster prone. For lower income countries,
   WII is one adaptation measure to mitigate damage by climate change.
   Using remote sensing and statistical data, changes in tracks of cyclones
   in the Bay of Bengal, the duration of damage by cyclone disasters, and
   areas affected by saltwater intrusion were analyzed to ascertain risk
   levels for disasters in the target area: Labutta township in the
   Ayeyarwady region. Furthermore, demand analysis of WII using discrete
   choice experiments, a question-based statistical survey method, revealed
   that farmers' demand of WIIs for cyclone landfall, flood, and drought is
   relatively greater than that for saltwater intrusion. This finding
   indicates that saltwater intrusion might not be a crucially important
   matter for farmers who cultivate rainfed rice, whereas inland water
   floods caused by cyclone landfall and drought caused for changing the

Title = {Mapping socio-ecological resilience along the seven economic corridors
   of the Belt and Road Initiative},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {309},

Abstract = {China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive development plan in
   terms of scale and scope. It aims at facilitating China's connectivity
   with the rest of the world through trade, investment, and infrastructure
   projects. BRI encompasses seven economic corridors, which cover over 100
   countries. Consequently, the spectrum of their social and ecological
   conditions is diverse and broad. To date, no systematic BRI scale study
   exists to assess the ecological challenges of these economic corridors
   and associate the challenges with the BRI's capacity to cope with them.
   Thus, it is of profound importance to understand the complex
   interactions between human (socialeconomic) and natural (ecological)
   systems, which are essential to design sustainable development policies
   in this vast region. This challenging task requires innovative and
   interdisciplinary research approaches in a policy relevant way. We
   address this gap by presenting a data-driven geospatial analysis on this
   complex entity using the Social-Ecological Systems approach.
   Methodologically, we use resilience analysis, as an equilibrium concept
   of Ecological Vulnerability (EV) and Adaptive Capacity (AC). A
   high-resolution geospatial resilience (the ability to withstand and
   reorganize disruptions when experiencing changes) mapping is made for
   the river basins along the BRI corridors to identify the drivers of
   resilience from 1990 to 2015. The results reveal highly diverse patterns
   of these drivers across the BRI economic corridors. The differences
   among the corridors grew within the study period. The root cause for the
   low resilience along the 21st-C Maritime Silk Road (predominantly the
   African continent) is low adaptive capacity, whereas higher ecological
   vulnerability is the main reason along the
   Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar, China-Pakistan, China-Central-Asia-West
   Asia, and China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridors. Further
   adaptation measures are needed to mitigate the risks related to
   decreased AC levels and increased EV levels. Investments under the
   initiative should better combine adequate physical infrastructure with
   improving institutional (both human talent development and efficient
   governance) and economic capacities to cope with the existing ecological
   vulnerability challenges. Finally, this study highlights that over time,
   AC has shown notable improvements, particularly in Asia, and in contrast
   to a less volatile EV. The equilibrium analysis between AC and EV offers
   a valuable resource for policy and decision-makers to plan and manage
   social-ecological resilience challenges within the seven economic
   corridors of the BRI, and plan adaptation and mitigation strategies.},

   are shown to give consistent ranges for future temperature changes. The
   consistency of these results, when obtained using independent
   techniques, demonstrates that past observed climate changes provide
   robust constraints on probable future climate changes. Such
   probabilistic predictions are useful for communities seeking to adapt to
   future change as well as providing important information for devising

Abstract = {Risk perception is a cognitive process whose aim is to guide people's
   behaviour in ordinary activities to reduce the impact of extreme events.
   In fact, the analysis of risk perception can be considered as a part of
   risk reduction strategies and adaptation measures. In this paper, the
   perception of the geo-hydrological risk by the population living or
   working in a stretch of the Tyrrhenian coast of Calabria (Southern
   Italy) is analysed. The study area has recently been affected by debris
   flow events, with damages to private and public facilities, as well as
   infrastructures. In particular, the study, based on a questionnaire
   survey, considers: i) general knowledge and personal experience of
   geo-hydrological phenomena; ii) awareness of risk exposure; iii)
   information and preparedness to geo-hydrological risks of the territory;
   iv) levels of safety. The results reveal that population consider the
   anthropic actions as a relevant cause of geo-hydrological phenomena.
   Moreover, the citizens of the study area, although showing a high civic
   sense, did not positively assess the actions of the local authorities,
   both in terms of territory management and people's education and/or
   information.},

   these goals involves changes in stakeholder attitudes about the meaning
   of beach nourishment and development of research initiatives to
   demonstrate the scientific, technologic, and economic feasibility of
   methods that are more compatible with maintaining or restoring natural
   landforms and habitats. Suggestions are made for expanding the spatial

Title = {How the Failure to Account for Flexibility in the Economic Analysis of
   Flood Risk and Coastal Management Strategies Can Result in Maladaptive
   Decisions},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {138},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper uses two alternative economic analysis approaches, net
   present value (NPV) and real in options (RIO), to show how the failure
   to incorporate uncertainty and flexibility in the economic analysis of
   flood risk and coastal management strategies can result in maladaptive
   decisions. RIO offers a major development on the conventional NPV
   approach, because it integrates expected changes in future levels of
   uncertainty into economic analysis. This study applies RIO analysis to
   the semihypothetical case study of a coastal defense system to
   demonstrate its applicability for decision making on climate change
   adaptation. In the case study, two different adaptive strategies are
   analyzed, consisting of a hard and soft structural alternative. Soft
   strategies are often inherently more flexible than hard strategies. The
   results of the case study show that the NPV approach increases the
   relative cost of soft strategies for the two alternatives compared with
   hard strategies, because it does not account for the value of
   flexibility built into adaptive strategies. It is therefore recommended
   that RIO analysis be used for the choice between hard and soft
   strategies to avoid maladaptation. This is particularly significant in
   cases where there is both high climate uncertainty and high decision
   uncertainty concerning the best strategy. DOI:

   Usefulness of Policy Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change conditions the sustainability of coastal destinations.
   This paper looks at the physical conditions that determine exposure and
   sensitivity to and risk from climate change and explores the
   sociopolitical contextual factors that determine the vulnerability of
   destinations. We define a destination's vulnerability to climate change
   as being a reduction in its attractiveness caused by climate change
   combined with the consequences of adaptation and mitigation strategies.
   To be more specific, this paper aims to discuss the linkage between
   policymaking and the vulnerability of coastal destinations to climate
   change. We look at how this vulnerability is determined by
   decision-making, policies and strategies and propose an innovative
   analytical framework to assess vulnerability using a policy analysis
   approach. It is our intention to combine a content analysis of policy
   documents with an analysis of the perceptions and opinions of the
   stakeholders that influence decision-making. The paper deals with the
   complex, multiple, dynamic and fuzzy attributes that characterize all
   the items that make up this kind of research: climate change
   (phenomenon), vulnerability (variable), policy analysis (method), policy
   contents and stakeholder perceptions (indicators), coastal destinations
   (territorial system) and tourism (activity and policy).},

Title = {Vulnerabilities shape risk perception and influence adaptive strategies
   to hydro-meteorological hazards: A case study of Indo-Fijian farming
   communities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {62},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Unique vulnerabilities are intrinsic to Pacific Island Countries which
   shape risk perception and influence adaptive decision making to natural
   hazards. This study aims to examine ongoing risks caused by
   hydrometeorological hazards, with a focus on micro-level household
   response to increasing vulnerabilities, in addition to macro-level
   community related vulnerabilities. Data collection was undertaken
   through semi-structured interviews in three hydro-meteorological
   hazard-prone communities, dominated by members of the Indi-Fijian
   community, that is, the Indian diaspora, in the Western part of Fiji.
   The findings were analysed using descriptive, interpretive and
   inferential analysis. The findings reveal that climatic, physical,
   cultural and socio-economic factors render households more vulnerable at
   a micro-level. The research also revealed that members of the Indian
   community normally have lower levels of societal cohesion, have an
   inherent individualistic approach to disasters and lack access to
   communal assets such as land, rendering them more vulnerable at a
   community level. As a coping mechanism, households were found to have a
   higher likelihood of adhering to social adaptive strategies such as
   making behavioural, informational, and educational changes for risk
   reduction. According to this study, participants show a high degree of
   risk perception with a sound understanding of storm surge, flood peaks
   and extents as well as prolonged dry spells. The study recommends

Abstract = {As climate change alters the behavior of Atlantic hurricanes, these
   storms are trending stronger, wetter, and slower moving over coastal and
   island populations. Hurricane Dorian exemplified all three attributes.
   Dorian's destructive passage over the Abaco Islands, Bahamas, on
   September 1, 2019, exposed residents of its capital, Marsh Harbour, to a
   prolonged encounter with the storm's core. After Dorian's fierce front
   eyewall and towering storm surge tore apart shanty town habitats and
   eviscerated concrete homesites, residents desperately sought refuge
   during the brief respite when Dorian's eye passed directly overhead. The
   category 5 winds then resumed abruptly and Dorian continued its
   relentless destruction. This article focuses on the storm's mental
   health consequences, drawing on observations of on-site clinicians as
   well as findings from previous research on the mental health effects of
   Atlantic hurricanes and the transformation of hurricane hazards
   resulting from climate change. To protect island and coastal populations
   against climate-driven storms, disaster planning policy should emphasize
   resilience-focused prevention and mitigation strategies. In the
   aftermath of these events, health system response should include
   community outreach, case finding, and evidence-based interventions that
   optimize the use of mental health professionals.},

Abstract = {The Seychelles is a small island state in the western Indian Ocean that
   is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This vulnerability led
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 to express
   concern over the potential economic and social consequences that may be
   faced by small island states. Small island states should be prepared to
   adapt to such changes, especially in view of their dependence on natural
   resources, such as water and coral reefs, to meet basic human welfare
   needs. Analysis of long-term data for precipitation, air temperature,
   and sea-surface temperature indicated that changes are already
   observable in the Seychelles. The increase in dry spells that resulted
   in drought conditions in 1999 and the 1998 mass coral bleaching are
   indicative of the events that are likely to occur under future climate
   change. Pre-IPCC Third Assessment Report scenarios and the new SRES
   scenarios are compared for changes in precipitation and air surface
   temperature for the Seychelles. These intercomparisons indicate that the
   IS92 scenarios project a much warmer and wetter climate for the
   Seychelles than do the SRES scenarios. However, a wetter climate does
   not imply readily available water, but rather longer dry spells with
   more intense precipitation events. These observations will likely place
   enormous pressures on water-resources management in the Seychelles.
   Similarly, sea-surface temperature increases predicted by the HADCM3
   model will likely trigger repeated coral-bleaching episodes, with
   possible coral extinctions within the Seychelles region by 2040. The
   cover of many coral reefs around the Seychelles have already changed,
   and the protection of coral-resilient areas is a critical adaptive
   option.},

   treatment by coastal wetlands, and that these can correspond to 1\% of
   gross domestic product for some countries. It is also observed that
   policies have been implemented in practice for mitigating degradation of
   coastal ecosystems, but these differ in different parts of the world.

Title = {Effectiveness of shading to mitigate the impact of high temperature on

Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Developmental success of sea turtle clutches depends on incubation
   temperature, which also determines sex ratio of hatchlings. As global
   temperatures are rising, several studies have proposed mitigation
   strategies such as irrigation and shading to increase hatching success.
   Our study expands upon this research and measures the effects of using
   boxes with different degrees of shade coverage (50\%, 80\%, and 90\%) on
   sand temperature and water content. Boxes were fully covered with fabric
   in 2017/2018 (top and sides) but were side open in 2018/2019. We took
   measurements at olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) and leatherback
   (Dermochelys coriacea) turtle nest depths (45 and 75 cm) at Playa
   Grande, Costa Rica. Shading reduced temperature by up to 0.8 degrees C
   and up to 0.4 degrees C at 45 cm and 75 cm, respectively. There were
   statistically significant differences between shading and control
   treatments at both depths, but differences between shade treatments were
   only significant when using side open boxes, possibly due to air flow.
   Shading had no effect on water content. While the impact of using shaded
   boxes on temperature was low, the potential impact on primary sex ratios
   was large. If shading were applied to leatherback clutches, the
   percentage of female hatchlings could vary by up to 50\%, with a maximum
   difference around the pivotal temperature (temperature with 1:1 sex
   ratio). Shading can be useful to increase hatching success, but we
   recommend avoiding it at temperatures within the transitional range
   (temperatures that produce both sexes), or using it only during the last
   third of incubation, when sex is already determined. As global warming
   will likely continue, understanding potential impact and effectiveness
   of mitigation strategies may be critical for the survival of threatened
   sea turtle populations.},

Title = {Groundwater as a social-ecological system: A framework for managing

Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {579-589},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical
   source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities.
   Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate
   change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region
   have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of
   groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the
   availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting
   water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater
   sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are
   social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and
   groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes.
   We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are
   associated with traditional command and control approaches to
   management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and
   ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources,
   and the dependant human communities can be managed independently.
   Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant
   social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of
   groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to
   order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and
   enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single
   conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage
   groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of
   three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and
   strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the
   framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater
   mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path.},

Abstract = {Climate change has moved to the top of the world's environmental agenda.
   Agriculture is an economic activity that is highly dependent on climate
   in order to produce the food and fiber necessary to sustain human life.
   The agriculture in India is highly sensitive to variations of weather
   and climate. The history of Indian agriculture reflect a series of
   adaptation. Soil, water, terrain, climate, technological developments
   and market factors provide constraints and opportunity for agricultural
   productions. Climate change has already been a reality for Indian
   farmers. These changes over time represent stimuli that affect the
   success of farming activities negatively and that prompt adjustments to
   altered circumstances. Since the inceptions of `sustainable agriculture'
   in Rio Summit in 1992, a diverse range of approaches are put forward by
   researchers, state organization, non governmental development bodies,
   private organization in India but guided by the basic principle of
   sustainability. Sustainable agriculture must be economically viable,
   socially responsible and conserve land, water, genetic and other
   resources for future generation. The aim of this review is to highlight
   the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture in India and the
   status of mitigation and adaptation strategies to sustain the Indian
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change presents a major threat to all levels of

   possess characteristics that increase their vulnerability to extinction.
   Here we review the conservation assessments of 414 threatened species
   and 108 ecological communities in the state of New South Wales (NSW)
   Australia, to explore climate change extinction risk. We found only 13\%
   of threatened species and 24\% of threatened ecological communities have
   climate change identified as a threat. Amphibians had the highest
   proportion of species with a climate change threat identified (37\%),
   followed by mammals (25\%), birds (17\%), reptiles (15\%) and plants
   (10\%). The sample sizes of freshwater algae and marine mammals were too

   that had climate change listed as a threat were predominately associated
   with wet and montane habitats, highlighting the vulnerability of these
   environments. The estimates of the extinction threat from climate change
   to species and ecological communities in NSW are likely to be highly
   conservative. We suggest that climate change adaptation strategies be
   incorporated into all levels of biodiversity management, from threatened
   species management plans to landscape level management.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change and urban heat islands are predicted to
   grow and compound in the future. In the context of urban heat becoming
   an increasing problem, this article explores the extent to which this is
   recognised in media. Our findings show that the issue of the urban heat
   island (UHI) effect appeared on media agendas over the period studied
   and that predominantly the issue of UHI was framed in four ways. The
   top-down mitigation frame focused on the proactive approach of local
   governments while highlighting inaction at state and national levels.
   The bottom-up mitigation frame presented a patchwork approach to dealing
   with UHI with a positive focus on the mitigation actions of individuals
   and the private sector, while the risks and vulnerabilities frame looked
   at the distribution and mapping of the health risks posed by the
   phenomena. However, the media analysis also highlighted two factors
   which have potentially negative consequences regarding science
   communication and citizen understandings of science. These are the
   ambiguous and/or cautious manner in which the UHI effect is referred to
   and the use of UHI as an alternative argument to climate change in the
   climate change debate frame.},

Volume = {138},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Experimental fishing is a powerful tool to support adaptive management
   by exploring. innovative fisheries practices, scientific approaches, and
   management actions. In the. United States, capacity and interest exist
   to use on-the-water experimentation to test. alternative ideas to meet
   the national standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and. promote
   sustainable fisheries. One program, the U.S. exempted fishing permit
   (EFP). program, administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration. (NOAA) within federal waters (3-200 nautical miles
   offshore), promotes. experimentation as a collaborative process between
   scientists, managers, and industry. to develop creative solutions to
   evolving fisheries challenges. Over a period of 11. years, 953 EFPs were
   issued in federal fisheries in the United States. Yet, to date no.
   comprehensive analysis of the impacts, challenges, and lessons learned
   have been. documented across the EFP program. Here, we developed the
   first standardized. nationwide database of EFPs in the U.S. and
   generated an overview of the program. aimed at providing key lessons for
   managers, fishers, scientists, and industry. The. study evaluated the
   program at both the national and regional levels defined by NOAA. We
   found that EFP projects that are industry-led, inclusive of more study
   participants,. and with strong scientific and programmatic support by
   partners were more informative to management outcomes. While
   programmatic differences between NOAA regions. contributed to project
   outcomes and their connection to management, all regional. programs
   would benefit from stronger documentation and a standardized database to
   facilitate program review and learning across regions to strengthen the
   utility of the. EFP program more broadly.},

Title = {Reassessing Existing Reservoir Supply Capacity and Management Resilience
   under Climate Change and Sediment Deposition},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Freshwater resources are limited and seasonally and spatially unevenly
   distributed. Thus, in water resources management plans, storage
   reservoirs play a vital role in safeguarding drinking, irrigation,
   hydropower and livestock water supply. In the last decades, the dams'
   negative effects, such as fragmentation of water flow and sediment
   transport, are considered in decision-making, for achieving an optimal
   balance between human needs and healthy riverine and coastal ecosystems.
   Currently, operation of existing reservoirs is challenged by increasing
   water demand, climate change effects and active storage reduction due to
   sediment deposition, jeopardizing their supply capacity. This paper
   proposes a methodological framework to reassess supply capacity and
   management resilience for an existing reservoir under these challenges.
   Future projections are derived by plausible climate scenarios and global
   climate models and by stochastic simulation of historic data. An
   alternative basic reservoir management scenario with a very low
   exceedance probability is derived. Excess water volumes are investigated
   under a probabilistic prism for enabling multiple-purpose water demands.
   Finally, this method is showcased to the Ladhon Reservoir (Greece). The
   probable total benefit from water allocated to the various water uses is
   estimated to assist decision makers in examining the tradeoffs between
   the probable additional benefit and risk of exceedance.},

Title = {Exploring visitor perceptions of the influence of climate change on
   tourism at Acadia National Park, Maine},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND
   MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study explores the range of perceptions about the impacts of
   climate change on tourism in one protected area, Acadia National Park,
   Mount Desert Island, Maine, US. Summer visitation to this park depends
   strongly on favorable weather conditions. An intercept survey was used
   to collect data on visitor perceptions about the role of weather and
   possible climate change on tourism in general, and their destination
   selection specifically. A total of 506 visitors participated in the
   study. The majority of participants expressed that climate change will
   affect tourism. Weather conditions are important and influence visitors'
   destination selection. Statistically significant differences between age
   groups and gender about the effects of climate change on tourism were
   identified. By understanding the perceptions of the visitors, suitable
   adaptive strategies and early preparedness actions may be developed to
   cope with the impacts of climate change to the nature-based tourism
   industry in national parks.
   MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
   Because nature-based tourism is highly-weather dependent, understanding
   visitor perceptions of destinations and their essential features will be
   crucial for sustainable tourism destination development. This
   qualitative study shows that the majority of visitors are concerned
   about climate change in a national park they visit, and would support
   agency efforts to mitigate possible climate change effects. Findings
   suggest public education and outreach to be relevant strategies for
   parks to enhance visitors' understanding of climate effects in the
   region and their role in reducing carbon-footprint. Management efforts,
   such as resource stewardship and mitigation strategies, should
   contemplate differences in perceptions of the effects of climate change
   and travel behavior according to visitor characteristics (e.g., age,
   gender) and market segments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {111},

Pages = {279-322},
Abstract = {Farmers in Africa are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change due to their high dependency on climate-sensitive natural
   resources. Kenyan farmers are faced with limited public agricultural
   extension services, narrowing their sources of useful information
   including adaptive strategies that would help them cope with the impacts
   of climate change. Radio can be an effective extension tool with the
   ability to reach many farmers in their local language. This study
   investigated the potential of radio in influencing the utilization of
   climate change information by farmers in Kilifi County, located along
   the Kenyan coast. Education and communication about climate change was
   undertaken using radio to make available and understandable information
   to different social and cultural groups. This study revealed that radio
   can effectively complement other agricultural extension methods and has
   the potential to engage farmers on climate change issues and motivate
   them to take action, if appropriate approaches are used. Although very
   few of the farmers surveyed (33\%) reported to have listened to the
   programs, a high percentage (82\%) of those who did implemented the
   recommended strategies and technologies they heard. The major challenges
   reported by farmers to accessing the radio programs were lack of a radio
   and unsuitable program timing. An additional reported challenge was the
   inability to store or record the programs resulting in farmers relying
   on their own recollection when implementing strategies. Further research
   should explore the use of social learning approaches that encourage
   group rather than individual listenership (such as community listening
   clubs and community-based radio schools) to overcome these challenges.},

Abstract = {Local strategies for adaptation to climate change in Denmark and Norway
   are discussed. In both countries, the national impetus for local
   adaptation is weak; it is largely left to local actors to take the
   initiative. The dynamics of the different approaches to climate-change
   adaptation at the local level are illuminated. Using decision-making and
   learning theory, we present an analytical framework to examine four

Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {234-255},
Abstract = {This paper identifies the conceptual similarities between ecological
   designs and ecosystem-based adaptations to climate change. The former
   includes approaches grounded in expert knowledge, such as landscape
   ecological urbanism, while the latter is rooted in local experiential
   knowledge and relies on community-based adaptations. This paper bridges
   these expert and experiential knowledge forms through a transactive
   planning model by deploying design charrettes in the context of Negril,
   Jamaica. The findings reveal that local people are aware of ecosystems
   and prefer ecologically sensitive adaptation interventions. This study
   concludes with planning and design recommendations for climate change
   adaptation in Negril.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Bangladesh is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. In
   particular, its riverine-island (char) dwellers face continuous
   riverbank erosion, frequent flooding, and other adverse effects of
   climate change that increase their vulnerability. This paper aims to
   assess the livelihood vulnerability of riverine communities by applying
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability
   framework and the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI). Results indicate
   substantial variation in the vulnerability of char dwellers based on
   mainland proximity. The main drivers of livelihood vulnerability are
   char-dweller adaptation strategies and access to food and health
   services. The study further reveals that riverbank erosion, frequent
   flood inundation, and lack of employment and access to basic public
   services are the major social and natural drivers of livelihood
   vulnerability. Char-based policy focusing on short- and long-term
   strategy is required to reduce livelihood vulnerability and enhance
   char-dweller resilience.},

Title = {Effectiveness of strategies at reducing sand temperature to mitigate
   potential impacts from changes in environmental temperature on sea
   turtle reproductive output},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {121-133},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sea turtle reproduction is heavily influenced by environmental
   temperature. Thus, projected changes in global temperatures are
   predicted to alter their reproductive output (e.g. hatchling sex ratio
   and success). Management strategies to mitigate potential threats have
   been identified, but little is known about their effectiveness. We
   tested how effective sprinkling nests with water and shading is at
   reducing sand temperature. We compared sand temperature at average green
   turtle (Chelonia mydas) nest depth in a controlled environment with 5
   different treatments: (1) shade (S), (2) shade with sprinkling during
   the day (SD) and (3) at night (SN), and (4) sprinkling during the day
   (ED) and (5) at night (EN) both exposed to sunlight. Not all strategies
   reduced the sand temperature; treatments with sprinkling during the day
   and shading on rainy days had warmer temperatures (0.83 +/- 1.20 A
   degrees C and 0.96 A +/- 0.41 A degrees C respectively) than control
   treatments. Sprinkling during the night at an exposed and shaded setting
   were most effective at reducing sand temperature (with sand temperature
   on average 2.23 A +/- 0.66 A degrees C and 1.43 A +/- 0.94 A degrees C
   lower than control, respectively). These strategies could potentially be
   effective in counteracting increases in temperature at nesting grounds
   used by the northern Great Barrier Reef green turtle by 2030, where
   predictions are for an increase of 0.2-1.8 A +/- 0.01-0.37 A degrees C.
   The effectiveness of strategies will likely vary regionally depending on
   the beach environment and setting used for the strategy.},

Abstract = {Although climate change adaptation plays a vital role in improving
   global food security, little is known about whether it can increase
   household food security of small-scale fishermen. This study offers new
   evidence by investigating the effect of climate change adaptation on
   household food security, measured by the food insecurity experience
   scale (FIES) and food consumption score (FCS). The cross-sectional data
   were collected from 301 small-scale fishermen in East Java Province,
   Indonesia. This study applied two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), and
   two-step predictor substitution (2SPS) approaches to solve an
   endogeneity issue in modelling the effect of climate change adaptation
   on household food security. This is achieved by considering the
   observable and the unobservable factors. The empirical result indicates
   that climate change adaptation significantly improves household food
   security. Further estimation also highlights the positive and
   significant effect of adaptation intensity on the food security
   measurement. Therefore, this study suggests that fishermen continuously
   apply adaptation strategies to improve their food security.},

Title = {Risks of precipitation extremes over Southeast Asia: does 1.5 degrees C
   or 2 degrees C global warming make a difference?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Guided by the target of the Paris Agreement of 2015, it is fundamental
   to identify regional climate responses to global warming of different
   magnitudes for Southeast Asia (SEA), a tropical region where human
   society is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Projected changes
   in indices characterizing precipitation extremes of the 1.5 degrees C
   and 2 degrees C global warming levels (GWLs) exceeding pre-industrial
   conditions are analyzed, comparing the reference period (1976-2005) with
   an ensemble of CORDEX simulations. The results show that projected
   changes in precipitation extreme indices are significantly amplified
   over the Indochina Peninsula and the Maritime Continent at both GWLs.
   The increases of precipitation extremes are essentially affected by
   enhanced convective precipitation. The number of wet and extremely wet
   days is increasing more abruptly than both the total and daily average
   precipitation of all wet days, emphasizing the critical risks linked
   with extreme precipitation. Additionally, significant changes can also
   be observed between the GWLs of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C,
   especially over the Maritime Continent, suggesting the high sensitivity
   of precipitation extremes to the additional 0.5 degrees C GWL increase.
   The present study reveals the potential influence of both 1.5 degrees C
   and 2 degrees C GWLs on regional precipitation over SEA, highlights the
   importance of restricting mean global warming to 1.5 degrees C above
   pre-industrial conditions and provides essential information on
   manageable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies for the
   developing countries in SEA.},

Title = {Environmental controls of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in Chinese
   inland waters},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {110},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) are expanding world-wide,
   adversely affecting aquatic food production, recreational and tourism
   activities and safe drinking water supplies. China's inland waters have
   been increasingly threatened by CyanoHABs during the past several
   decades. The environmental factors controlling CyanoHABs are highly
   variable in space and time in China due to significant variations in
   climate, geography, geological and geochemical conditions among its many
   regions. Here, we synthesize diverse examples among Chinese water bodies
   regarding interactive effects of anthropogenic, climatic and geographic
   drivers influencing CyanoHAB potentials and dynamics in lakes and
   reservoirs; in order to provide a perspective and integrative approach
   to mitigating CyanoHABs. In China's many shallow water bodies, water
   quality is highly susceptible to human activity and to changing climatic
   and hydrological conditions, when compared to deeper lakes. Rapid
   increases in population, economic activity, and wastewater have
   accelerated CyanoHABs in China since 1980s, especially in the heavily
   urbanized, agricultural and industrial regions in the middle and lower
   Yangtze River basins. Climatic changes have provided an additional
   catalyst for expansion of CyanoHABs. In particular, rising spring
   temperatures have accelerated the onset and proliferation of Microcystis
   spp, blooms in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River basin.
   Large hydroelectric and water supply projects, like the Three Gorges
   Reservoir (TGR), have altered hydrological regimes, and have led to an
   increase of CyanoHABs in reservoirs and tributaries due to increases in
   water residence times. Manipulating water level fluctuations in the TGR
   may prove useful for controlling CyanoHAB in its tributary bays.
   Overall,CyanoHAB mitigation strategies will have to incorporate both N
   and P input reductions in these shallow systems. Furthermore, nutrient
   reduction strategies must consider climate change-induced increases in
   extreme weather events, including more intense rainfall and protracted
   heat waves and droughts, which can extend the magnitudes and duration of
   CyanoHABs. Ensuring the maintenance of natural hydrologic connectivity
   between lakes and rivers is of utmost importance in mitigating CyanoHABs
   throughout China.},

Abstract = {Specific climate adaptation and resilience measures can be efficiently
   designed and implemented at regional and local levels. Climate and
   environmental databases are critical for achieving the sustainable
   development goals (SDGs) and for efficiently planning and implementing
   appropriate adaptation measures. Available federated and distributed
   databases can serve as necessary starting points for municipalities to
   identify needs, prioritize resources, and allocate investments, taking
   into account often tight budget constraints. High-quality geospatial,
   climate, and environmental data are now broadly available and remote
   sensing data, e.g., Copernicus services, will be critical. There are
   forward-looking approaches to use these datasets to derive forecasts for
   optimizing urban planning processes for local governments. On the
   municipal level, however, the existing data have only been used to a
   limited extent. There are no adequate tools for urban planning with
   which remote sensing data can be merged and meaningfully combined with
   local data and further processed and applied in municipal planning and
   decision-making. Therefore, our project CoKLIMAx aims at the development
   of new digital products, advanced urban services, and procedures, such
   as the development of practical technical tools that capture different
   remote sensing and in-situ data sets for validation and further
   processing. CoKLIMAx will be used to develop a scalable toolbox for
   urban planning to increase climate resilience. Focus areas of the
   project will be water (e.g., soil sealing, stormwater drainage,
   retention, and flood protection), urban (micro)climate (e.g., heat
   islands and air flows), and vegetation (e.g., greening strategy,
   vegetation monitoring/vitality). To this end, new digital process
   structures will be embedded in local government to enable better policy
   decisions for the future.},

   FISHERIES IN THE ETERNAL OCEAN},
Series = {Fisheries Science Series},
Year = {2018},
Pages = {229-245},
Abstract = {The contributions of all the chapters in this book are integrated to
   give a perspective on the requirements for realizing the sustainable
   fisheries of dynamic resources. A comprehensive overview of the whole
   process of data gathering, analyzing, and decision-making for fisheries
   assessment and management is presented in a sequential adaptive way as a
   plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle and illustrated in a schematic diagram.
   The process is a loop of sequential information updates and adaptive
   decision-making in the actual world parallel with the corresponding
   virtual world. Some points along the panoramic diagram are discussed
   with reference to discussions in previous chapters. Issues discussed are
   (1) diversity of management objectives and performance measures:
   multidisciplinary approach; (2) development of harvest control rules
   (HCRs); (3) revealing dynamics of stocks, communities, and ecosystems:
   mechanistic approach; (4) value of monitoring for adaptive management:
   empirical approach; (5) assessment models vs. operating models: to what
   extent should they be complex?; and (6) social institution and
   organization for fisheries management. The ocean is eternal in its
   existence; however, its components are never static but dynamic. Since
   fish communities dynamically change with climate-induced ocean regime
   shifts, we humans have no choice but to adapt to the nature of
   ecosystems. The benefits of the ocean will be eternal for us only if we
   successfully achieve such an adaptation.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are increasingly affected by climate-induced disturbances
   that are magnified by increasing ocean temperatures. Loss of coral reefs
   strongly affects people whose livelihoods and wellbeing depend on the
   ecosystem services reefs provide. Yet the effects of coral loss and the
   capacity of people and businesses to adapt to it are poorly understood,
   particularly in the private sector. To address this gap, we surveyed
   about half (57 of 109) of Australian reef tourism operators to
   understand how they were affected by and responded to severe impacts
   from bleaching and cyclones. Reef restoration and spatial
   diversification were the primary responses to severe bleaching impacts,
   while for cyclone-impacts coping measures and product diversification
   were more important. Restoration responses were strongly linked to the
   severity of impacts. Our findings provide empirical support for the
   importance of response diversity, spatial heterogeneity, and learning
   for social-ecological resilience.},

Title = {Simulating micro-scale thermal interactions in different building

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {663},
Pages = {610-631},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Tropical cities are more susceptible to the suggested fall outs from
   projected global warming scenarios as they are located in the Torrid
   Zone and growing at rapid rates. Therefore, research on the mitigation
   of urban heat island (UHI) effects in tropical cities has attained much
   significance and increased immensely over recent years. The UHI
   mitigation strategies commonly used for temperate cities need to be
   examined in the tropical context since the mechanism of attaining a
   surface energy balance in the tropics is quite different from that in
   the mid-latitudes. The present paper evaluates the performance of four
   different mitigation strategies to counterbalance the impact of UHI
   phenomena for climate resilient adaptation in the Kolkata Metropolitan
   Area (KMA), India. This has been achieved by reproducing the study
   sites, selected from three different urban morphologies of open
   low-rise, compact low-rise and mid-rise residential areas, using
   ENVI-met V 4.0 and simulating the effects of different mitigation
   strategies-cool pavement, cool roof, added urban vegetation and cool
   city (a combination of the three former strategies), in reducing the UHI
   intensity. Simulation results show that at a diurnal scale during
   summer, the green city model performed best at neighborhood level to
   reduce air temperature (T-a) by 0.7 degrees C, 0.8 degrees C and 1.1
   degrees C, whereas the cool city model was the most effective strategy
   to reduce physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) by 2.8 degrees
   -3.1 degrees C, 2.2 degrees -2.8 degrees C and 2.8 degrees - 2.9 degrees
   C in the mid-rise, compact low-rise and open low-rise residential areas,
   respectively. It was observed that (for all the built environment types)
   vegetation played the most significant role in determining surface
   energy balance in the study area, compared to cool roofs and cool
   pavements. This study also finds that irrespective of building
   environments, tropical cities are less sensitive to the selected
   strategies of UHI mitigation than their temperate counter parts, which
   can be attributed to the difference in magnitude of urbanness. (C) 2019

Abstract = {In this study, we compare the perception of climate change in two
   different tourist settings of northeastern Spain: the Catalan Pyrenees
   and the Catalan Mediterranean coast and the Balearic Islands. We carried
   out a survey of 906 cases (506 in the coastal areas of Catalonia and the
   Balearic Islands and 400 in the Catalan Pyrenees) asking residents on
   those areas to assess the possible effects of climate change on
   tourist-related activities. While the existence of climate change and of
   its estimated impacts is widely accepted, we observe statistically
   significant differences in most of the questions between residents in
   the coastal areas and residents in the Pyrenees. In general terms,
   respondents from the Pyrenees display a much higher concern regarding
   the economic impacts of climate change on tourism. On the other hand,
   the results also show that some demographic groups, such as women,
   members of large households, or unemployed, tend to present higher
   levels of concern. This study may give new hints on which tourist
   modalities and which groups are more concerned for the impacts of
   climate change in Mediterranean tourist environments and could translate
   into more targeted adaptive and mitigation practices.},

   and mitigation strategies},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The threat of desertification is considered a global concern that occurs
   in many environments in different parts of the world, where extensive
   lands are transformed gradually into desert or semi-desert areas, and
   this causes economic and health issues. Iraq and many other parts of the
   Middle East are facing desertification threats in the last twenty years.
   Despite the significance of this issue, relevant reviews are scarce. The
   removal of vegetation cover, overgrazing, deforestation in times of war,
   poor irrigation practices and water scarcity are some of the main causes
   of desertification in Iraq. Fighting desertification requires
   cooperative efforts including the utilization of innovative practices,
   biotechnological approaches, restoration of oases, continuous
   reforestation, and rehabilitation of agricultural lands. The objective
   of this review article is to discuss the causes of desertification and
   land degradation in Iraq, highlighting the main natural and human
   factors involved, and the consequent impact on the national security,
   economy, society, and health. In addition, it suggests recommendations
   for policies and actions that can be integrated to mitigate this
   problem.},

Title = {An approach to adaptation to climate changes in Poland},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {443-451},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adopted by COP 10 (Dec 1/CP.10) and approved by the MOP1, the Buenos
   Aires programme of adaptation and response measures opens doors to
   intensify preparations for expected climate change. By this decision the
   COP, requested the SBSTA to develop a structured 5-year programme of
   work of the SBSTA on the scientific, technical and socio-economic
   aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate
   change. Consequently, the COP, by its decision 2/CP.11, adopted the
   ``Five-year programme of work of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and
   Technological Advice on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate
   change{''} Finally during COP12 this programme was approved as ``Nairobi
   Work Programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate
   change{''}. This programme has fundamental significance not only for
   developing countries, but also for industrialized nations in which some
   sectors of the or social life are particularly vulnerable to climate
   change, specifically, inter alia EIT countries and new EU Member States.
   Further development of this adaptation programme economy should contain
   steps that provide optimum economic and social effectiveness, risk
   management, identification of vulnerable sectors and gaps in knowledge,
   preparation of a list of policy options, including an analysis of cost
   effectiveness, selection of the most effective policies, and a
   preparedness implementation plan. In Poland the preliminary adaptation
   programme covered agriculture, water management, and coastal zone
   management. For the time being, gaps in knowledge and preparedness
   measures have been identified. An estimation of possible impact on these
   areas was based on chosen GCMs, and sea level rise IPCC scenarios. In
   conclusion, it was stated that the results achieved should be seen as a
   first step forward and a more comprehensive study is necessary to update
   the results and cover other sectors of the economy, such as health
   protection, spatial planning, ecosystems and forestry, and to develop
   specific guidelines and recommendations for policy-makers.},

Title = {Integrating four radiant heat load mitigation strategies is an efficient
   intervention to improve human health in urban environments},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {698},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Increasing heat in urban areas raises heat-related health risks. Green
   infrastructure and managing surface albedo can reduce the radiation
   exposure of pedestrians. However, selecting options among various
   radiant fluxes mitigation strategies is challenging, particularly due to
   potential interactions among options such as planting vegetation or
   changing surface albedos. We used a multi-strategies model for
   determining optimal design combinations for reducing mean radiant
   temperature (MRT) in urban environments across a range of costs and
   benefits. The solutions are developed by a non-dominated sorting genetic
   algorithm II (NSGA II) with a MRT simulator. We selected four MRT
   reduction strategies: tree planting, grass planting, albedo reduction of
   building walls, and albedo reduction of sidewalks. Model test results
   for a simulated street canyon show a wide range of optimal alternative
   plans considering the combination effects of the four strategies. While
   previous studies have focused on single options to reduce heat load, we
   found benefits were higher by using a combination of these strategies,
   which can provide synergistic benefits. These results provide useful
   information for decision makers confronting real world problems such as
   heat related mortality. Thermal-friendly design methods and green
   infrastructure will help the urban environment become sustainable and
   improve human health and well-being. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Caribbean Small-Scale Fishers' Strategies for Extreme Weather Events:
   Lessons for Adaptive Capacity from the Dominican Republic and Belize},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {456-480},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Understanding how Caribbean small-scale fishers can adapt to climate
   change is critical to sustaining coastal communities and livelihoods in
   the region. Fishers continuously adapt their practices to climate
   variability and recurring extreme weather events, such as hurricanes.
   However, it remains unclear how their ``everyday{''} responses
   contribute to building their adaptive capacity for future changes and
   unpredictable extreme climate events. This paper identifies and analyzes
   strategies used by fishers in the Dominican Republic and Belize to deal
   with extreme weather events and climate variability. We draw on two
   separate case studies to identify their current autonomous adaptive
   strategies and explore how these align with broader dimensions of
   adaptive capacity. We find that fishers in both countries respond to
   changes and climate variability by relying on three strategies: (1)
   storing, saving and borrowing resources, (2) using experiential
   knowledge, flexibility and mobility, and (3) diversifying livelihoods
   and intensifying fishing. We show that fishers build their adaptive
   capacity on flexibility to sustain their livelihoods and on local
   knowledge to mitigate risk and damage from extreme weather events. The
   paper argues that the adaptive responses used by fishers in the
   Dominican Republic and in Belize can sustain their livelihoods but
   cannot enable a long term and transformative adaptation to ongoing and
   cumulative climate changes.},

Title = {No treeline shift despite climate change over the last 70 years},
Journal = {FOREST ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: The recent rise in temperature and shifting precipitation
   regimes threaten ecosystems around the globe to different degrees.
   Treelines are expected to respond to climate warming by shifting to
   higher elevations, but it is unclear whether they can track temperature
   changes. Here, we integrated high-resolution aerial imagery with local
   climatic and topographic characteristics to study the treeline dynamic
   from 1945 to 2015 on the semi-arid Mediterranean island of Crete,
   Greece.
   Results: During the study period, the mean annual temperature at the
   treeline increased by 0.81 degrees C, while the average precipitation
   decreased by 170 mm. The treeline is characterized by a diffuse form,
   with trees growing on steep limestone slopes (>50 degrees) and shallow
   soils. Moreover, the treeline elevation decreases with increasing
   distance from the coast and with aspect (south > north). Yet, we found
   no shift in the treeline over the past 70 years, despite an increase in
   temperature in all four study sites. However, the treeline elevation
   correlated strongly with topographic exposure to wind (R-2 = 0.74, p <
   0.001). Therefore, the temporal lag in treeline response to warming
   could be explained by a combination of topographic and microclimatic
   factors, such as the absence of a shelter effect and a decrease in
   moisture.
   Conclusion: Although there was no treeline shift over the last 70 years,
   climate change has already started shifting the treeline altitudinal
   optimum. Consequently, the lack of climate-mediated migration at the
   treeline should raise concerns about the threats posed by warming, such
   as drought damages, and wildfire, especially in the Mediterranean
   region. Therefore, conservation management should discuss options and
   needs to support adaptive management.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the process and results of stakeholder focus
   groups conducted as part of a larger multi-year, National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration-sponsored, transdisciplinary coastal
   resilience research project in the northern US Gulf of Mexico. The focus
   groups' purpose was to better understand local coastal professionals'
   and decision-makers' (e.g., natural resource managers, community
   planners, extension and outreach specialists) views on mitigation
   options for coastal hazards (e.g., storm surge, nuisance flooding, sea
   level rise) including use of natural and nature-based features (NNBF;
   e.g., sand dunes, living shorelines, oyster reefs). Overall, results
   revealed that participants were aware of various mitigation options, had
   favorable views toward NNBF infrastructure, and perceived five major
   benefits and six major barriers or challenges with such approaches.
   Designing and implementing NNBF infrastructure was perceived as complex
   and requiring several types of ecological and socioeconomic
   considerations and information for decision-making. We conclude with a
   discussion of findings, practical implications for coastal resilience
   planning and management, and recommendations for future research.},

Title = {Adaptation to climate change in the Ontario public health sector},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Background: Climate change is among the major challenges for health this
   century, and adaptation to manage adverse health outcomes will be
   unavoidable. The risks in Ontario - Canada's most populous province -
   include increasing temperatures, more frequent and intense extreme
   weather events, and alterations to precipitation regimes.
   Socio-economic-demographic patterns could magnify the implications
   climate change has for Ontario, including the presence of rapidly
   growing vulnerable populations, exacerbation of warming trends by
   heat-islands in large urban areas, and connectedness to global
   transportation networks. This study examines climate change adaptation
   in the public health sector in Ontario using information from interviews
   with government officials.
   Methods: Fifty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted, four
   with provincial and federal health officials and 49 with actors in
   public health and health relevant sectors at the municipal level. We
   identify adaptation efforts, barriers and opportunities for current and
   future intervention.
   Results: Results indicate recognition that climate change will affect
   the health of Ontarians. Health officials are concerned about how a
   changing climate could exacerbate existing health issues or create new
   health burdens, specifically extreme heat (71\%), severe weather (68\%)
   and poor air-quality (57\%). Adaptation is currently taking the form of
   mainstreaming climate change into existing public health programs. While
   adaptive progress has relied on local leadership, federal support,
   political will, and inter-agency efforts, a lack of resources constrains
   the sustainability of long-term adaptation programs and the acquisition
   of data necessary to support effective policies.
   Conclusions: This study provides a snapshot of climate change adaptation
   and needs in the public health sector in Ontario. Public health
   departments will need to capitalize on opportunities to integrate
   climate change into policies and programs, while higher levels of
   government must improve efforts to support local adaptation and provide
   the capacity through which local adaptation can succeed.},

Title = {How do sustainable livelihoods influence environmental (non-) migration
   aspirations?},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {124},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Every individual strives to improve their quality of life, and
   therefore, adopts strategies to cope with the adverse situation of their
   livelihood. The decision to migrate (i.e. migration) or to stay (i.e.
   non-migration) is one such strategy to combat unexpected disturbances to
   their livelihoods. This research assessed the relationship between
   socio-ecological systems (SES) and livelihood conditions and determined
   how a sustainable livelihood influences non-migration decisions of
   people living at risk. The field study employed a mixed-methods approach
   in five villages in southwest coastal Bangladesh. Findings revealed that
   livelihood options differ across SES settings and that (non-)migration
   aspirations mostly depend on livelihood adaptation options which shape
   the individual's sustainable livelihood status in the face of future
   disaster risk. Thus, understanding the SES settings will help in
   advocating for livelihood options regarding non-migration aspirations
   for people at risk.},

Title = {Forecasting industrial water demand in Huaihe River Basin due to
   environmental changes},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {469-483},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A framework is proposed for forecasting industrial water demand in the
   context of climate change, economic growth, and technological
   development. The framework was tested in five sub-basins of Huaihe River
   of China, namely Upstream of Huaihe River (UH), Middlestream of Huaihe
   River (MH), Downstream of Huaihe River (DH), Yishusi River (YSSR), and
   Coastal River of Shandong Peninsula (CSP) to project future changes in
   industrial water demand under different environment change scenarios.
   Results showed that industrial water demand in Huaihe River basin will
   increase in the range of 10 to 44.6\% due to economic development,
   water-saving technological advances, and climate change. The highest
   increase was projected by general circulation model (GCM) BCC-CSM1-1
   (179.16 x 108 m(3)) and the lowest by GCM GISS-E2-R (132.4 x 10(8) m(3))
   in 2020, while the GCM BNU-ESM projected the highest increase (190.57 x
   10(8) m(3)) and GCM CNRM-CM5 the lowest (160.41 x 10(8) m(3)) in 2030.
   Among the different sub-basins, the highest increase was projected in MH
   sub-basin where industrial water demand is already very high. On the
   other hand, the lowest increase in industrial water demand was projected
   in UH sub-basin. The rapid growth of high water-consuming industries and
   increased water demand for cooling due to temperature rise are the major
   causes of the sharp increase in industrial water demand in the basin.
   The framework developed in the study can be used for reliable
   forecasting of industrial water demand which in turn can help in
   selection of an appropriate water management strategy for adaptation to
   global environmental changes.},

Abstract = {The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon is commonly solved by
   implementing materials with optimal thermic and evapotranspiration
   properties which help decreasing the air temperature in dense urban
   areas. This approach has been applied in this study, testing six
   different materials (replacing the current Macadam) in one parking area
   in Bari (Italy), which provides a large-scale testbed, by means of a
   thermal three-dimensional non-hydrostatic simulation: impervious asphalt
   pavement (IAP), asphalt permeable pavement (APP), green pavement (GP),
   green pavementasphalt permeable pavement (GP+APP), grey porous concrete
   blocks (GCB), and light concrete permeable pavement (LCPP). The
   highest-performance pavements in terms of potential air temperature (PAD
   reduction were the GP (-1.22 degrees C), GCB (-1.26 degrees C) and LCPP
   (-1.22 degrees C), which also showed a constant relative humidity,
   suggesting their UHI mitigation benefits. A comparison of the structural
   properties as well as the construction and maintenance costs of such
   pavements is also provided, finding the best mitigation strategy (GCB).},

Journal = {CLIMATE},

Abstract = {This study presents the results of an impact analysis of climate change
   on salinization and the long-term availability of drinking water
   resources along the river Lek, a tidal branch of the Rhine delta, and a
   potential mitigation measure. To this end, a one-dimensional modelling
   approach was used that enabled studying 50 years of variation in
   discharge and tide in current and future climate. It was found that all
   locations are increasingly vulnerable to salt intrusion caused by the
   combination of sea level rise and decreasing river discharges. This
   affects both the yearly average chloride concentration and long duration
   exceedances of the threshold value of 150 mg/L. It was also found that
   diverting a higher fresh water discharge to the Lek of several tens of
   cubic meters per second reduces the risk of salinization at the upstream
   inlet locations. However, the increased influence of seawater intrusion
   on the drinking water inlets cannot be fully compensated for by this
   measure. The potential gain of the extra water for the drinking water
   inlets along the Lek has to be balanced against the impact of this
   measure on water levels and stream flows in other parts of the river
   system.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather is becoming one of the fierce symptoms of rapidly
   changing climate era which is causing long and short term damage at
   different aspects of our day-to-day life. Extreme weather events like
   heavy rains cause sewers to overflow and may result in urban flooding a
   common scenario to the cities in developing countries like Bangladesh.
   With a current population of 1.4 million estimated to rise to 2.9
   million by 2030, Khulna is more prone to urban flooding due to lower
   topography and sea-level rise due to climate change. This research aims
   to find the different aspects of climatic vulnerability and how the city
   is sustaining by gaining resilience and adaptation in the hostile
   climatic condition due to climate change and sea level rise. Different
   spatial analysis viz. land use-land cover mapping, flood mapping based
   on Digital Elevation Model, catchment delineation, hazard and risk
   mapping, physical vulnerability, etc. carried out to understand the
   climatic hazard condition and its impacts on different aspects. It is
   found that 0.25m and 0.50m sea level rise (SLR) leads to inundate 5\%
   and 9\% of the city where 4\% and 6\% are agriculture respectively
   within the city. Within this range, residential uses inundate 0.50\% and
   1\% respectively. The city has 52\% open field and greeneries and 14\%
   waterbodies which can absorb 0.50m SLR accepting 1\% inundation of the
   residential land uses. This research would help city decision-makers to
   make them more familiar with the climate resilience and adaptation
   options in relation to the growing concern of the city and choose the
   right decision.},

Abstract = {Few regions of the world are at higher risk for environmental disasters
   than the Pacific Island countries and territories. During 2004 and 2005,
   the top public health leadership from 19 of 22 Pacific Island countries
   and territories convened 2 health summits with the goal of developing
   the world's first comprehensive regional strategy for sustainable
   disaster risk management as applied to public health emergencies. These
   summits followed on the objectives of the 1994 Barbados Plan of Action
   for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and
   those of the subsequent Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action for a Safer
   World. The outputs of the 2004 and 2005 Pacific Health Summits for
   Sustainable Disaster Risk Management provide a detailed description of
   challenges and accomplishments of the Pacific Island health ministries,
   establish a Pacific plan of action based upon the principles of disaster
   risk management, and provide a locally derived, evidence-based approach
   for many climate change adaptation measures related to extreme weather
   events in the Pacific region. The declaration and outputs from these
   summits are offered here as a guide for developmental and humanitarian
   assistance in the region (and for other small-island developing states)
   and as a means for reducing the risk of adverse health effects resulting
   from climate change. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2012;

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Volume = {30},

Pages = {925-933},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is increasingly recognised that designing and implementing adaptive
   land management and development policies for the coastal zone requires
   an interdisciplinary and integrated approach. Yet, integrative thinking
   and action often remain problematic due to the competing interests and
   ambitions involved in coastal zone planning and management and the
   legacy of established development on the coast. This paper presents a
   developmental timeline to critically consider institutional responses to
   coastal development and seeks to locate contemporary challenges, such as
   climate change, in the context of a new environmental determinism. The
   argument is put forward that securing a shared understanding of
   development conditions and risks needs to be predicated on creating more
   robust conditions for interaction and fostering a sounder appreciation
   of the inter-dependencies of natural processes and governance. The
   concept of resilience is critically explored in order to consider a
   normative analytical framework for facilitating social learning and
   developing a reciprocal understanding of social-ecological dynamics that
   offers a spectrum of resilience options. This is illustrated in the
   context of coastal geomorphological processes and Process-Defined
   Management Units. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Jamaica, like most Small Island Developing States around the world, is
   at high risk of coastal hazards due to its exposure to tropical storms,
   high levels of coastal development, vulnerable coastal communities, and
   the predicted impacts of climate change. Environmental degradation has
   been linked to increased vulnerability to disasters. Nature-based
   Solutions, although not formally present in the literature, are being
   implemented at various scales in Jamaica. This paper presents an
   overview of three marine and coastal Nature-based Solutions being
   utilised in the country: protected area management (Special Fishery
   Conservation Areas); mangrove restoration; and coral restoration. The
   paper briefly reviews their current application in Jamaica before
   arguing that these conservation projects that traditionally focused on
   biodiversity have co-benefits as Nature-based Solutions for disaster
   resilience. The paper closes by outlining several research objectives
   that should be explored in the future to further the implementation of
   Nature-based Solutions for disaster resilience in Jamaica.},

Title = {Identifying trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation and development in
   community responses to climate and socio-economic stresses: Evidence
   from Zanzibar, Tanzania},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {111-121},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine how communities in Zanzibar cope with and
   adapt to multiple-stressors including climate change, and how these
   responses affect long-term adaptation, mitigation and development (AMD)
   goals. In particular, we identify the multiple-stressors that affect
   natural-resource dependent communities in Zanzibar. We then explore how
   community responses affect long-term development and mitigation goals
   before we examine the barriers to maximising AMD synergies in community
   responses. We use the DPSIR (Drivers - Pressures - States - Impacts -
   Response) as a tool to organise the complex information relating to both
   the marine and terrestrial SES in Zanzibar. Using data from household
   surveys and community-level focus groups, we find that responses to
   stressors resemble coping strategies as they provide short-term relief
   but in the long-term may negatively affect development goals.
   Furthermore, responses generate a trade-off between adaptation,
   mitigation and development. For example, when farmers respond to low
   productivity by spending longer on the farm, there is a development
   trade-off as time burdens are increased, and a mitigation trade-off as
   secondary forest cannot be established. We identify that AMD compatible
   responses are constrained by resource, regulatory, learning and
   governance barriers. We conclude that without local climate policy
   intervention, `mal-adaptations', which threaten both mitigation and
   development goals, could occur across a range of temporal and spatial
   scales. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Global climate change risk to fisheries-A multi-risk assessment},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Our study explores variations in the risk of fishery-dependent coastal
   nations to ocean acidification, sea surface temperature change, sea
   level rise, and storms. Our findings reveal differences in risk based on
   geographical location and the development status of a country. Our
   findings indicate significant geographical differences for three of the
   four risk indicators including sea level rise, sea surface temperature
   changes, and storms. Strategies for reducing risk globally thus need to
   be adapted to regional differences in risks. We further detected
   multiple inter-regional differences, indicating that risk was not
   uniformly distributed within geographic regions sug-gesting that some
   regions could see an increase in conflicts over fish resources due to
   uneven impacts of climate change on fisheries. In addition, we found
   that a number of countries are at medium to very high risk to multiple
   climate-related impacts, indicating the need for strategies that
   increase adaptive capacity in general in these countries to cope with
   any kind of impact in addition to specific risk reduction strategies. We
   also found that overall small island developing states were most at
   risk. Yet, further analysis showed that grouping of countries in
   pre-defined groups fails to detect variations in risk among countries
   within these groups. More specific na-tional indicators provide more
   nuanced insights into risk patterns.},

Abstract = {Shallow subsurface resources are progressively used for the production
   of geothermal energy, i.e. for the installation and operation of a broad
   variety of Geothermal Energy Systems (GES). Additionally, in many urban
   areas there is a surplus of heat from large buildings and constructions
   reaching into the groundwater saturated zone. Likewise, groundwater is
   more often used as a cheap cooling medium. As a result, significantly
   increased subsurface temperatures have been observed in many urban
   areas.
   Several studies investigated how the so-called ``Subsurface Urban Heat
   Island{''} (SUM) effect and how current thermal subsurface regimes
   developed. However, a sustainable management of subsurface resources
   requires a general understanding on how ``current thermal states{''} of
   subsurface and thermal regimes developed in context of different urban
   settings and boundary conditions. These aspects yet are mostly
   unexplored. In practice mitigation measures are generally taken for
   individual projects. Thereby, a consideration of the broader context of
   hydrogeological and thermal processes and boundaries and the interacting
   thermal activities could lead to a more sustainable use of subsurface
   energy resources.
   Besides providing an overview of subjects related to the thermal
   management of urban subsurface resources this review paper summarizes
   the results from different research projects that have been realized in
   the densely urbanised area of Basel in northwestern Switzerland. (C)

Abstract = {Vietnam is exposed to different types of floods that cause severe
   economic losses, damage to infrastructure, and loss of life. Reliable
   information on the drivers, patterns and dynamics of flood risk is
   crucial for the identification, prioritization and planning of risk
   reduction and adaptation measures. Here, we present a systematic review
   of existing flood risk assessments in Vietnam. We evaluate the current
   status, persisting gaps, and challenges regarding the understanding and
   assessment of flood risk in the country. The literature review revealed
   that: (i) 65 \% of the reviewed papers did not provide a clear
   definition of flood risk, (ii) assessments had a tendency to prioritize
   physical and environmental drivers of risk over social, economic or
   governance-related drivers, (iii) future-oriented assessments tended to
   focus on hazard and exposure trends, while vulnerability scenarios were
   often lacking, (iv) large and middle-sized cities were assessed more
   frequently than others, (v) only few studies engaged with relevant local
   stakeholders for the assessment of risk and the development of potential
   solutions, and (vi) ecosystem-based adaptation and flood risk insurance
   solutions were rarely considered. Based on these findings, we point out
   several directions for future research on flood risk in Vietnam.},

Title = {Urban heat stress mitigation potential of green walls: A review},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cities with resilience to climate change appear to be a vision of the
   future, but are inevitable to ensure the quality of life for citizens
   and to avoid an increase in civilian mortality. Urban green
   infrastructure (UGI), with the focus on vertical green, poses a
   beneficial mitigation and adaptation strategy for challenges such as
   climate change through cooling effects on building and street level.
   This review article explores recent literature regarding this
   considerable topic and investigates how green walls can be applied to
   mitigate this problem. Summary tables (see additional information) and
   figures are presented that can be used by policy makers and researchers
   to make informed decisions when installing green walls in built-up
   environments. At last, knowledge gaps are uncovered that need further
   investigation to exploit the benefits at its best.},

Abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are
   particularly vulnerable to climate change and will continue to require
   external support to adapt to current and future impacts. The
   international development community plays an important role in
   supporting SIDS adapt to climatic changes, and calls for increased
   international commitment have been made. However, how the vulnerability
   of SIDS to climate change is being conceptualised and, subsequently, how
   adaptation programmes are conceived and designed by the international
   development community are yet to be critically explored. Using
   Timor-Leste as a case study, this study examines the conceptual trends
   underpinning 32 donor-led adaptation programmes implemented from 2010 to
   the present date. Results show that donor-led adaptation programmes
   continue to conceptualise climate change vulnerability as a biophysical
   issue rather than a consequence of the dynamic interactions between
   political, institutional, economic and social structures. Adaptation
   policy responses therefore have limited ability to target more nuanced
   and broader-scale structures affecting SIDS and may be falling short in
   their efforts to reduce the vulnerability of SIDS. We argue that it is
   critical that the international development community re-conceptualise
   its approach to vulnerability reduction in SIDS. We conclude by
   highlighting how the Paris Agreement, with its expanding understanding
   of vulnerability, can act as a useful instrument to promote such
   changes.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1635-1645},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A common complication in invasive pest management is that the infectious
   state of the host can be wrongly assessed, leading to biases in the
   estimation of the prevalence of the pest and on the efficacy of
   mitigation actions. We designed a multievent model that accommodates
   uncertainty on host state to investigate the dynamics of the infestation
   of Phoenix canariensis by the invasive Rhynchophorus ferrugineus. Since
   2011, the council of Palma city (Mallorca Island, Spain) applied
   preventive, curative and destructive treatments to public Phoenix palms.
   A year later awareness campaigns focused on every palm owner in an
   attempt to control the plague. We estimated the probability of
   infestation and assessed the efficiency of mitigation measures,
   awareness campaigns and palm-dependent covariates. Our results show that
   infestation probabilities were higher for palms infested in the previous
   year than for healthy palms and it decreased substantially over time as
   a results of mitigation measures and awareness campaigns. Palms
   surrounded by treated palms had a lower probability of being infested
   than palms surrounded by untreated palms, i.e. private palms before
   awareness campaigns implementation. Our results highlight the key role
   of awareness campaigns and public participation for invasive species
   control.},

Abstract = {Fisheries around the world are declining due to growing anthropogenic
   pressures including climate change and overexploitation. Understanding
   how small-scale fishers respond to this unprecedented challenge is
   critical for developing more effective management strategies in
   vulnerable socio-ecological systems. While considerable research is
   focused on adaptation to change in marine contexts, greater attention is
   urgently needed on regionally important but often neglected inland
   fisheries. This study analyzes the adaptation intentions of littoral
   fishers on Lake Tanganyika, a biodiversity hotspot and one of the
   largest inland fisheries in Africa. Data were collected through
   in-person surveys of 154 littoral fishers across 11 major landing sites
   in Tanzania. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, we identified and
   tested 15 individual and site-level factors as potential indicators of
   adaptation intentions to a hypothetical 50\% decline in catch. Our
   results show that fishers with other (non-fishing) primary livelihoods
   are more likely to adapt in ways that decrease fishing pressure,
   increase income, and are supported by family and friends. Homeowners
   were also more likely to adapt in ways that lessen fishing pressure. Our
   findings highlight the importance of fostering regional adaptation
   strategies that increase primary livelihood alternatives and capital
   outside the fishery, while discouraging investment in adaptations
   focused on increasing catch amount or fishing income.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {787-804},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Empirical studies of residential flood vulnerability have generally
   concentrated on either the geophysical characteristics or the
   socio-economic characteristics of a given region, rather than a
   combination of the two. In addition, studies using subjective
   assessments of flood vulnerability are not very common. However, due to
   the fact that people's perceptions influence their risk behaviour, and
   therefore their vulnerability, understanding perceptions about a
   phenomenon is very significant for the design of effective communication
   as well as mitigation, coping, and adaptation strategies. This study
   uses a digital map (to calculate mean elevation, slope, proximity to
   lagoon, sea, and drain length by area) and the EDULINK Round II
   Household Survey (for socio-demographic characteristics of households)
   for the analysis. Perception of flood vulnerability is derived from
   responses from heads of households to the question, ``Do you perceive
   your household to be vulnerable to floods?{''} The responses are either
   in the affirmative or negative. Results show that even when a subjective
   assessment of vulnerability is undertaken, it is geophysical
   characteristics that have significant associations with perceptions of
   flood vulnerability.},

   and ethics},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {133},
Number = {3},
Pages = {361-373},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Of the carbon dioxide that we emit, a substantial fraction remains in
   the atmosphere for thousands of years. Combined with the slow response
   of the climate system, this results in the global temperature increase
   resulting from CO2 being nearly proportional to the total emitted amount
   of CO2 since preindustrial times. This has a number of simple but
   far-reaching consequences that raise important questions for climate
   change mitigation, policy and ethics. Even if anthropogenic emissions of
   CO2 were stopped, most of the realized climate change would persist for
   centuries and thus be irreversible on human timescales, yet standard
   economic thinking largely discounts these long-term intergenerational
   effects. Countries and generations to first order contribute to both
   past and future climate change in proportion to their total emissions. A
   global temperature target implies a CO2 ``budget{''} or ``quota{''}, a
   finite amount of CO2 that society is allowed to emit to stay below the
   target. Distributing that budget over time and between countries is an
   ethical challenge that our world has so far failed to address. Despite
   the simple relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature, the
   consequences for climate policy and for sharing the responsibility of
   reducing global CO2 emissions can only be drawn in combination with
   judgments about equity, fairness, the value of future generations and
   our attitude towards risk.},

Abstract = {The on-going climate change threats are rapidly growing at both global
   and local scales, affecting ecosystems, societies and economies by
   altering natural distribution and productivity of key commercial
   species. Although the ecosystem based management (EBM) focuses on
   ecosystem equilibria, to provide realistic management measures for
   important activities at sea such as fisheries and aquaculture, there is
   a need of quantities; mechanistic approaches are suggested as reliable
   solutions. Here, a Dynamic Energetic Budget (DEB) application studies
   the link between environmental change (temperature forecasted increasing
   scenario in a context of COP 21 {[}Paris climate conference Agreement]
   and food density increase) and life-history traits of some Mediterranean
   fishery and aquaculture target species (Engraulis encrasicolus,
   Dicentrarchus labrax, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Crassostrea gigas). A
   sensitivity analysis was applied to simulate the effects of future
   environmental change on the time needed to reach the commercial size and
   the length at first maturity. We also explored the efficiency of
   Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture (IMTA) as a potential management
   solution in a context of an adaptive EBM. The worst scenario of rising
   temperatures (+2 degrees C) seems to reduce the time needed to reach the
   commercial size in most species and IMTA potentiates the thermal effect
   on it. A spatial contextualisation of model outcomes allowed
   disentangling potential conflicts among human activities at sea. The DEB

Volume = {53},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Climate change-induced extreme temperature events are becoming more
   intense and frequent. For fish, temperature is the master abiotic factor
   that controls and limits fish development and physiology at all stages
   of aquaculture. Major physiological constraints at the individual level
   underpin changes in fish growth, hemato-physiology, metabolism, immune
   and molecular stress responses to extreme temperature events. Extreme
   temperature impacts on fish vary among and within the diverse species
   depending on stress magnitude and associated factors. This review
   synthesizes the impacts of climate change-induced extreme temperature
   events on neuroendocrine, oxidative, metabolic, osmotic, molecular,
   hemato-biochemical, and immune responses in fish related to aquaculture.
   Besides, overall aspects of extreme temperature impacts on fish growth
   and reproduction are also discussed. Possible mitigation measures to
   maintain the fish's physiological fitness during extreme temperature
   events are also addressed. However, studies on the interactive effects
   of extreme temperature events with other associated environmental
   stressors are needed across a broader range of species to gain a better
   understanding of fish response and aquaculture performance during
   extreme temperature events. Moreover, for fish, studies on alternative
   species, development of stress-tolerant strains, and the possibilities
   of nutritional mitigation measures as a potential option to combat
   extreme temperature stress are promising and should be pursued in future
   studies.},

Title = {Should Cities Embrace Their Heat Islands as Shields from Extreme Cold?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1309-1320},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The higher temperature in cities relative to their rural surroundings,
   known as the urban heat island (UHI), is one of the most well documented
   and severe anthropogenic modifications of the environment. Heat islands
   are hazardous to residents and the sustainability of cities during
   summertime and heat waves; on the other hand, they provide considerable
   benefits in wintertime. Yet, the evolution of UHIs during cold waves has
   not yet been explored. In this study, ground-based observations from 12
   U.S. cities and high-resolution weather simulations show that UHIs not
   only warm urban areas in the winter but also further intensify during
   cold waves by up to 1.32 degrees +/- 0.78 degrees C (mean +/- standard
   deviation) at night relative to precedent and subsequent periods.
   Anthropogenic heat released from building heating is found to contribute
   more than 30\% of the UHI intensification. UHIs thus serve as shelters
   against extreme-cold events and provide benefits that include mitigating
   cold hazard and reducing heating demand. More important, simulations
   indicate that standard UHI mitigation measures such as green or cool
   roofs reduce these cold-wave benefits to different extents. Cities,
   particularly in cool and cold temperate climates, should hence revisit
   their policies to favor (existing) mitigation approaches that are
   effective only during hot periods.},

Title = {Coastal erosion risk assessment to discuss mitigation strategies:
   Barra-Vagueira, Portugal},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Worldwide coastal zones present serious erosion problems that cause loss
   of territory. This phenomenon exposes people and goods to the threat,
   being necessary to carry out a well-founded management of these areas.
   Coastal erosion risk assessment methodologies are an important tool for
   coastal management. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate
   and discuss coastal management strategies based on the application of a
   methodology of coastal erosion risk classification, allowing easy
   comparison of scenarios. The study was developed for the Portuguese
   coastal stretch Barra-Vagueira. CERA methodology and its plugin for QGIS
   software were applied in order to assess the erosion risk of
   Barra-Vagueira stretch for different coastal erosion mitigation
   scenarios. First, an analysis of the coastal erosion risk was carried
   out based on bibliographic elements and present situation
   characterization. Subsequently, the erosion risk was assessed
   considering defence, relocation and nourishment strategies scenarios and
   climate change scenarios. The study based on bibliographic elements
   shows that the coastal region between Barra and Vagueira has a high risk
   of coastal erosion. Generally, the different scenarios tested represent
   variations on coastal erosion risk classification, allowing a simple
   first approach to evaluate coastal erosion mitigation scenarios, helping
   planning and decision-makers. Performing measures that allow to
   constrain the shoreline retreat, as artificial nourishments, leads to
   greater benefits in reducing the area of the territory classified with
   higher risk. New coastal defence structures allow to mainly decrease the
   stretch's susceptibility to coastal erosion. The relocation of
   population leads to a decrease in the area of the territory classified
   as very high-risk. Climate change increases the erosion risk.},

Abstract = {Climate changes and urbanization are the main causes of the urban heat
   island. Defined as the air temperature rising in the urban areas despite
   of the rural ones, it amplifies the global warming phenomenon. The
   absence of green areas, open water and free unsurfaced spaces creates a
   sort of urban cap and a heat reflection effect, from the bottom upwards,
   which persists in the early hours of the night. This paper aims to
   investigate different technical solutions to mitigate the microclimatic
   conditions and to improve the thermal comfort of the citizens of a
   densely populated Roman area: Mirti square in the Centocelle district.
   This area is a good describer of the local urban heat island, because it
   shows a high density of buildings, a lack of vegetation and an absence
   of water sources like fountains. So, this area has a high thermal stress
   and the high presence of people raises the benefits of the mitigation
   techniques chosen for Mirti square.
   A numerical model was developed thought ENVI-met in order to assess the
   effects of the mitigation techniques in terms of air temperature
   decrease. The main techniques considered are the implementation of the
   urban vegetation, the use of cool pavements, the use of a canopy and the
   use of water stretch.
   Experimental data such as air temperature and relative humidity were
   collected in order to set up the boundary conditions and to calibrate
   the numerical model.},

Title = {Assessment of climate change impacts on flooding vulnerability for
   lowland management in southwestern Taiwan},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Taiwan suffers from losses of economic property and human lives caused
   by flooding almost every year. Flooding is an inevitable, reoccurring,
   and the most damaging disaster in Taiwan since Taiwan is located in the
   most active tropic cyclone formation region of the Western Pacific.
   Flooding problem is further worse in land subsidence areas along
   southwestern coast of Taiwan due to groundwater overdraft. Increasing
   number of people is threatened with floods owing to climate change since
   it would induce sea level rise and intensify extreme rainfall.
   Assessments of flooding vulnerability depend not only on flooding
   severity, possible damage of assets exposed to floods should also be
   simultaneously considered. This paper aims at exploring how climate
   change might impact the flooding vulnerability of lowland areas in
   Taiwan. A flooding vulnerability evaluation scheme is proposed in this
   study which incorporates flooding severity (the maximum inundation depth
   determined by a two-dimensional model) and potential economic losses for
   various land uses. Effects of climate change on flooding vulnerability
   focus on alterations of rainfall depth for various recurrence intervals.
   The flood-prone Yunlin coastal area, located in southwestern Taiwan, is
   chosen to illustrate the proposed methodology. The results reveal that
   reducing flooding vulnerability can be achieved by either reducing
   flooding severity (implementation of flood-mitigation measures) or
   decreasing assets exposed to floods (suspension of land uses for
   flood-detention purpose). Performance of currently implemented
   flood-mitigation measures is insufficient to reduce flooding
   vulnerability when facing with climate change. However, the scenario
   suggested in this study to sustain room for floods efficiently reduces
   flooding vulnerability in both without- and with climate change
   situations. The suggestions provided in this study could support
   decision processes and help easing flooding problems of lowland
   management in Taiwan under climate change.},

Abstract = {Coastal regions worldwide are during the process of rapid urban
   expansion. However, expanded urban settlements in land-sea interfaces
   have been faced with unprecedented threats from climate change related
   hazards. Adaptation to coastal hazards has received increasing attention
   from city managers and planners. Adaptation and land management
   practices are largely informed by remote sensing and land change
   modeling. This paper establishes a framework that integrates land change
   analysis, coastal flooding, and sea level rise adaptation. Multilayer
   perceptron neural network, similarity learning, and binary logistic
   regression were applied to analyze spatiotemporal changes of
   residential, commercial, and other built-up areas in Bay County,
   Florida, USA. The prediction maps of 2030 were produced by three models
   under four policy scenarios that included the population relocation
   strategy. Validation results reveal that three models return overall
   acceptable accuracies but generate distinct landscape patterns.
   Predictions indicate that planned retreat of residents can greatly
   reduce urban vulnerability to sea level rise induced flooding. While
   managed realignment of the coast brings large benefits, the paper
   recommends different mixes of adaptation strategies for different parts
   of the globe, and advocates the application of reflective land use
   planning to foster a more disaster resilient coastal community.},

Abstract = {This systematic review article focuses on the adaptation strategies of
   Asian fishermen toward climate change impacts. Generally, the fact that
   climate change is not a new phenomenon has attracted scholars to conduct
   numerous relevant studies. Unfortunately, most past researches were not
   from the perspectives of social science of the Asian's community. Hence,
   the present study reviewed a considerable amount of past studies on the
   act of adjusting with environmental change among the Asian fishermen
   which is known as one of the communities that are highly dependent on
   nature stability. Meanwhile, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was adopted for the review of the
   current research which utilised two main journal databases, namely
   Scopus and Web of Science. Accordingly, the searching efforts resulted
   in a total of 18 articles that can be analysed systematically. Most
   importantly, the review managed to formulate five main themes, namely
   livelihood diversification, social, physical infrastructure,
   awareness-knowledge-experience, and conservation and enforcement based
   on the thematic analyses. Overall, further analysis of the five themes
   resulted in the establishment of a total of 21 sub-themes. Finally, a
   number of recommendations were presented at the end of this research for
   the reference of future scholars. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In 2011 a research project on volcanic risk assessment at La Reunion
   Island (Project Alea, Institute de Physique du Globe de Paris, France)
   was conducted in order to determine more efficient strategies to manage
   future volcanic crises. The project included the evaluation of volcanic
   scenarios through field and historical data analysis, as well as a
   survey on volcanic risk perception in resident population. A clear
   scientific information and an effective communication with public play a
   crucial role in risk mitigation strategies. Moreover the evaluation of
   the public perception during both volcanic crises and dormant periods is
   an important element in developing actions focused on specific social
   and cultural contexts. For this porpose a questionnaire was developed
   based on the ones used in similar researches conducted on Italian active
   volcanoes. Items were designed to measure variables connected with
   personal perception of hazard and risk, trust in mitigation actions and
   in information received about these aspects. In addition, specific items
   related to the peculiarities of La Reunion Island environment were
   included. A total of 2000 questionnaires were distributed taking into
   account factors such as the proximity to the volcano and the involvement
   of communities in recent volcanic emergencies. Main results coming out
   from this survey, if on the one hand show an adequate residents'
   perception of natural hazards, on the other hand highlight their poor
   knowledge of the island's active volcano, a similar lacking knowledge of
   emergency plan for volcanic crises, but also a high confidence in
   scientists to provide accurate and reliable information on volcanic risk
   and hazards in contrast with Local Authorities. Remarkable findings of
   this study assess some key elements that should be considered by the
   institutions in charge for defining policies aimed at volcanic risk
   mitigation and management of future volcanic crises.},

Title = {Outdoor comfort conditions in urban areas: On citizens' perspective
   about microclimate mitigation of urban transit areas},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {16-36},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Understanding citizen environmental perception is a crucial issue to
   improve outdoor environmental and landscape quality. This paper is aimed
   at investigating the perspective of travelling citizens about local
   microclimate conditions in a transportation open-air hub of an urban
   district in central Italy, to propose effective mitigation strategies.
   Therefore, a survey was submitted to pedestrians while crossing the area
   to understand their actual perception of visual-thermal-acoustic
   conditions characterizing the outdoor environment, with varying weather
   and personal characteristics. Simultaneously, the continuous in-situ
   monitoring of the main environmental parameters was performed. Finally,
   the benefits generated by selected microclimate mitigation and landscape
   improvement strategies were quantitatively assessed by means of
   validated microclimate district models. Results of the field survey
   highlighted the minor tolerance of the local environment by local
   citizens compared to tourists, especially those coming from denser and
   more polluted cities. Moreover, the simulations confirmed the capability
   of selected microclimate mitigation strategies against anthropogenic
   heat, to improve pedestrians' outdoor thermal comfort conditions in
   summer, without winter penalties. In particular, the vegetation
   increase, according to pedestrians' request for additional green areas,
   combined to other solutions for sustainable landscape change, showed the
   most significant impact in summer overheating mitigation and urban
   resilience to anthropogenic climate change.},

Title = {Social Participation and Disaster Risk Reduction Behaviors in Tsunami
   Prone Areas},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {This paper examines the relationships between social participation and
   disaster risk reduction actions. A survey of 557 households in tsunami
   prone areas in Phang Nga, Thailand was conducted following the 2012
   Indian Ocean earthquakes. We use a multivariate probit model to jointly
   estimate the likelihood of undertaking three responses to earthquake and
   tsunami hazards (namely, (1) following disaster-related news closely,
   (2) preparing emergency kits and/or having a family emergency plan, and
   (3) having an intention to migrate) and community participation. We find
   that those who experienced losses from the 2004 tsunami are more likely
   to participate in community activities and respond to earthquake
   hazards. Compared to men, women are more likely to prepare emergency
   kits and/or have an emergency plan and have a greater intention to
   migrate. Living in a community with a higher proportion of women with
   tertiary education increases the probability of engaging in community
   activities and carrying out disaster risk reduction measures.
   Individuals who participate in village-based activities are 5.2\% more
   likely to undertake all three risk reduction actions compared to those
   not engaging in community activities. This implies that encouraging
   participation in community activities can have positive externalities in
   disaster mitigation.},

Title = {Beyond binary outcomes in climate adaptation: The illustrative case of
   desalination},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article develops an integrated approach to understanding adaptation
   outcomes. Current debates tend to consider actions to respond to climate
   change as either adaptive or maladaptive, leading to binary framings of
   outcomes as either successful or harmful. To address this, our article
   considers the vast space that exists between success and failure in
   climate change adaptation, highlighting the importance of applying the
   concepts of successful adaptation and maladaptation jointly in analyses
   of such outcomes. To this end, we develop an integrated framework to
   examine the major adaptive and maladaptive effects induced by
   large-scale seawater desalination. Now a major component of water supply
   in cities and regions around the world, desalination is increasingly
   viewed as an adaptation to water challenges linked with climate change.
   Based on a comprehensive review of the (successful/mal)adaptation
   literature, we present a matrix that will help academics and
   practitioners think through the complex and overlapping outcomes of
   adaptation via desalination in the water sector. We then discuss the
   insights concerning the configurations of desalination's adaptive and
   maladaptive outcomes. Overall, we present a threefold argument: (1) that
   examining successful outcomes alongside maladaptive ones enables a more
   complete and nuanced understanding of the overall effects of adaptation
   actions and their spatial and temporal distribution; (2) that a
   consideration of this can help to highlight the tradeoffs and
   constraints that are inherent in adaptation in order to support
   decision-making; and (3) that a more complex approach to adaptation
   outcomes can assist in problematizing the social-political drivers and
   consequences of adaptation.

Title = {The Role of Social-Ecological Resilience in Coastal Zone Management: A
   Comparative Law Approach to Three Coastal Nations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Around the globe, coastal communities are increasingly coping with
   changing environmental conditions as a result of climate change and
   ocean acidification, including sea level rise, more severe storms, and
   decreasing natural resources and ecosystem services. A natural
   adaptation response is to engineer the coast in a perilous and often
   doomed attempt to preserve the status quo. In the long term, however,
   most coastal nations will need to transition to approaches based on
   ecological resilience-that is, to coastal zone management that allows
   coastal communities to absorb and adapt to change rather than to resist
   it-and the law will be critical in facilitating this transition.
   Researchers are increasingly illuminating law's ability to promote
   social-ecological resilience to a changing world, but this
   scholarship-mostly focused on U.S. law-has not yet embraced its
   potential role in helping to create new international norms for
   social-ecological resilience. Through its comparison of coastal zone
   management in Australia, Finland, and the Netherlands, this article
   demonstrates that a comparative law approach offers a fruitful expansion
   of law-and-resilience research, both by extending this research to other
   countries and, more importantly, by allowing scholars to identify
   critical variables, or variable constellations associated with
   countries' decisions to adopt laws designed to promote social-ecological
   resilience and to identify mechanisms that allow for a smoother
   transition to this approach. For example, our comparison demonstrates,
   among other things, that countries can adopt coastal zone management
   techniques that integrate social-ecological resilience without fully
   abandoning more traditional engineering approaches to adapt to
   environmental change and its impacts.},

Title = {Resilience assessment of Puerto Rico's coral reefs to inform reef
   management},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Globally increasing sea surface temperatures threaten coral reefs, both
   directly and through interactions with local stressors. More resilient
   reefs have a higher likelihood of returning to a coral-dominated state
   following a disturbance, such as a mass bleaching event. To advance
   practical approaches to reef resilience assessments and aid
   resilience-based management of coral reefs, we conducted a resilience
   assessment for Puerto Rico's coral reefs, modified from methods used in
   other U.S. jurisdictions. We calculated relative resilience scores for
   103 sites from an existing commonwealth-wide survey using eight
   resilience indicators-such as coral diversity, macroalgae percent cover,
   and herbivorous fish biomass and assessed which indicators most drove
   resilience. We found that sites of very different relative resilience
   were generally highly spatially intermixed, underscoring the importance
   and necessity of decision making and management at fine scales. In
   combination with information on levels of two localized stressors
   (fishing pressure and pollution exposure), we used the resilience
   indicators to assess which of seven potential management actions could
   be used at each site to maintain or improve resilience. Fishery
   management was the management action that applied to the most sites.
   Furthermore, we combined sites' resilience scores with projected ocean
   warming to assign sites to vulnerability categories. Island-wide or
   community-level managers can use the actions and vulnerability
   information as a starting point for resilience-based management of their
   reefs. This assessment differs from many previous ones because we tested
   how much information could be yielded by a ``desktop{''} assessment
   using freely-available, existing data rather than from a customized,
   resilience-focused field survey. The available data still permitted
   analyses comparable to previous assessments, demonstrating that desktop
   resilience assessments can substitute for assessments with field
   components under some circumstances.},

Title = {Vulnerability to the effects of climate change and adaptation: The case
   of the Spanish Ebro Delta},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change is widely recognised as serious threat along the coastal
   areas of the Mediterranean Basin, where increased erosion patterns,
   decreased sediment discharge, intensification of floods, saltwater
   intrusion and loss of biodiversity increase vulnerability. These issues
   are of particular concern for the Ebro Delta. This article examines the
   vulnerability of the Spanish Ebro Delta to climate change effects using
   existing studies, projections, and interviews. The aim is to identify
   possible options for climate change adaptation in order to moderate the
   vulnerability to problematic conditions. The results show that to date
   human management has had a higher impact on this area than climate
   change. It was also shown that the majority of interviewees recommend
   the softest option for adaptation, the one that is most in harmony with
   the nature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Social cognition of climate change in coastal community: A case study in
   Xiamen City, China},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Climate change has caused a series of social, economic and environmental
   consequences both at global and regional scales, especially for the
   urbanized coastal areas in China. Sea level rise and extreme weather
   threaten human and property safety, as well as sustainable development
   in China's densely populated coastal areas; all those factors bring new
   challenges to costal management. This paper takes a typical coastal
   city, Xiamen City as a case to study the residents' cognition of climate
   change, and based on questionnaire survey in coastal communities to
   explore the strategy development dealing with the climate change under
   integrated coastal management (ICM) framework. The social cognition
   survey includes three aspects: knowledge of the climate change,
   perception of the impact of climate change and response to the climate
   change. The results showed that the resident's knowledge on climate
   change and its risk was still at a relatively low level on average.
   Among effects of climate change, temperature rise can be easily
   identified by people, while sea level rise is less known by residents.
   Facing climate change, if residents have plans reactively, we think
   their attitudes are positive, i.e. evacuation is seen as negative. It is
   delight that 69.6\% residents' attitude to adapt climate change is
   positive. 42.0\% of residents prefer protective measures rather than
   adjustment measures when facing climate change. Furthermore, we explored
   the primary factors that influence residents' cognition and selection
   preference on adapting measures through logistic regression. Our study
   suggests that public cognition significantly affect public participation
   on climate change and the community-based planning and management on
   climate change is urgently in need in the rapidly developing
   urbanization coastal areas, which will play an important role in
   integrated coastal management.},

Title = {Livelihood Vulnerability and Displacement in Coastal Bangladesh:
   Understanding the Nexus},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION},
Series = {Climate Change Management},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {9-31},
Abstract = {Although numerous researches came up with various estimates about
   climate migrants from coastal Bangladesh, yet the connections between
   vulnerability and forced displacement are poorly understood. This
   research is aimed first, to assess the linkages between people's
   livelihood vulnerability and their intention for outmigration from the
   coast; second, to identify the vulnerability reduction measures,
   implementation of which may significantly arrest the likely trend of
   forced migration. Empirical part of this research was conducted in three
   coastal villages in Bangladesh. A total of 285 respondents were randomly
   interviewed using a semi structured questionnaire. Given the scenario of
   sea level rise (SLR), respondents were first asked-what they or their
   descendent would probably do if their most parcels of farmland gradually
   go under half-knee deep (20-25 cm) sea water by the middle of this
   century. Then they were asked to identify the nature of livelihood
   vulnerability for which, they or their descendent may permanently leave
   their current place of residences. Finally, they were advised to
   identify various vulnerability reduction measures, implementation of
   which will reduce their vulnerability as well as will arrest the likely
   trend of forced migration. Findings suggest that one in every three
   families will be forced to migrate. Therefore, about five million people
   may turn out as climate migrants. There emerged a clear linkage between
   mass displacement and sources of livelihood vulnerability. Finally,
   Binomial logistic regression model has identified six vulnerability
   reduction measures from a total of 18 which will significantly arrest
   the likely trend of forced migration by minimizing people's exposure and
   sensitivity and enhancing adaptive capacity. The policy implication is
   to avoid the occurrence of any large scale forced migration from the
   vulnerable coast of Bangladesh measures must be initiated in line with
   the findings without further delay.},

Abstract = {River fragmentation and alterations in flow and thermal regimes are the
   main stressors affecting migrating fish, which could be aggravated by
   climate change and increasing water demand. To assess these impacts and
   define mitigation measures, it is vital to understand fish movement
   patterns and the environmental variables affecting them. This study
   presents a long-term (1995-2019) analysis of upstream migration patterns
   of anadromous and potamodromous brown trout in the lower River Bidasoa
   (Spain). For this, captures in a monitoring station were analyzed using
   Survival Analysis and Random Forest techniques. Results showed that most
   upstream movements of potamodromous trout occurred in October-December,
   whereas in June-July for anadromous trout, although with differences
   regarding sex and size. Both, fish numbers and dates varied over time
   and were related to the environmental conditions, with different
   influence on each ecotype. The information provided from comparative
   studies can be used as a basis to develop adaptive management strategies
   to ensure freshwater species conservation. Moreover, studies in the
   southern distribution range can be crucial under climate warming
   scenarios, where species are expected to shift coldwards.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for quantifying benefits and costs of
   extensive green roofs as an urban strategy for adaptation to climate
   change. It seeks to highlight the consequences of threshold effects in
   the delivery of the benefits and non-linearity with respect to green
   roof coverage. The analysis focuses on energy savings for cooling,
   carbon footprint reduction, avoided water treatment and reduction of
   heat-stress related mortality. Applying the methodology to the case
   study of the city of Madrid ( Spain) reveals that for climate scenarios
   where observed temperatures are closer to thresholds, misspecification
   of the services is more likely to bias the decision of using green roofs
   as an urban strategy to mitigate the effects of climate change. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Climate change and variability may have an impact on the occurrence of
   food safety hazards at various stages of the food chain, from primary
   production through to consumption. There are multiple pathways through
   which climate related factors may impact food safety including: changes
   in temperature and precipitation patterns, increased frequency and
   intensity of extreme weather events, ocean warming and acidification,
   and changes in contaminants' transport pathways among others. Climate
   change may also affect socio-economic aspects related to food systems
   such as agriculture, animal production, global trade, demographics and
   human behaviour which all influence food safety.
   This paper reviews the potential impacts of predicted changes in climate
   on food contamination and food safety at various stages of the food
   chain and identifies adaptation strategies and research priorities to
   address food safety implications of climate change. The paper concludes
   that there is a need for intersectoral and international cooperation to
   better understand the changing food safety situation and in developing
   and implementing adaptation strategies to address emerging risks
   associated with climate change. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most complex global environmental problems,
   impacting the physical and biological systems of aquatic, terrestrial
   and marine environments. India is among one of the most vulnerable
   countries that has already been experiencing changes in climate and the
   impacts of climate change. Various sectors such as agriculture,
   forestry, health, socio-economy, etc. have found to be severely affected
   by the implications of climate change in the country. Significant
   impacts over the forest ecosystems, global biodiversity and ecosystem
   integrity have also been observed in recent days. Apart from reduction
   in forest productivity, a shift in the forest type boundaries along
   altitudinal and rainfall gradients have been found. Loss of sea ice,
   rapid warming, and higher organic inputs affect marine and lake
   productivity, while combined impacts of wildfire and insect outbreaks
   decrease forest productivity. All these emerging uncertainties due to
   climate change have found to aggravate the problems of future food
   security within the country. Despite putting numerous efforts to
   mitigate the effects of climate change, India has failed in responding
   sufficiently in dealing the issue of climate change. Thus, it is
   imperative to come up with more effective adaptation and mitigation
   strategies in order to combat the effects of climate change.},

Title = {Adaptation privilege and Voluntary Buyouts: Perspectives on
   ethnocentrism in sea level rise relocation and retreat policies in the
   US},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {10-13},

Abstract = {The coast is a highly populated environment that is under increasing
   risk because of sea level rise (SLR) and climate change. Social science
   predicts that social and political systems will habitually privilege
   certain communities and disadvantage others under conditions of risk and
   disaster. This paper tests that supposition on a particular disaster
   policy in the United States. Voluntary buyouts are a policy tool in the
   US that has the potential to help communities adapt to SLR. While
   buyouts have been resisted in the past, there is some indication that
   they are becoming more politically popular. Despite increased
   popularity, communities in Alaska who need to relocate because of
   repetitive flooding and sea level rise do not meet the basic
   requirements of the buyout program in a way that makes this policy
   applicable to their situation. We find that notions of the market,
   property, and individualism are ideological assumptions inherent to the
   buyout policies, which ultimately serve to disadvantage tribal
   communities as they attempt to relocate as an adaptation strategy to
   climate change. This analysis suggests that adaptation policies to
   climate change themselves, can limit the inventory of possibilities that
   some communities have to choose from, and re-entrench inequity in the
   face of risk.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise has serious consequences for harbor infrastructure, storm
   drains and sewer systems, and many other issues. Adapting to sea level
   rise requires comparing different possible adaptation strategies,
   comparing the cost of different actions (including no action), and
   assessing where and at what point in time the chosen strategy should be
   implemented. All these decisions must be made under considerable
   uncertainty in the amount of sea level rise, in the cost and
   prioritization of adaptation actions, and in the implications of no
   action. Here we develop two illustrative examples: for Bergen on
   Norway's west coast and for Esbjerg on the west coast of Denmark, to
   highlight how technical efforts to understand and quantify uncertainties
   in hydrologic projections can be coupled with concrete decision-problems
   framed by the needs of the end-users using statistical formulations.
   Different components of uncertainty are visualized. We demonstrate the
   value of uncertainties and show for example that failing to take
   uncertainty into account can result in the median-projected damage costs
   being an order of magnitude smaller.},

Title = {Implications of climate change for shipping: Ports and supply chains},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Ports are an important economic actor-at local, national, and
   international scales-that have been identified as being vulnerable to
   future changes to the climate. This paper details the findings from an
   international review of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning climate
   risks, and adaptation responses, for ports and their supply chains.
   Evidence from both academic and gray literature indicates that there has
   already been major damage and disruption to ports across the world from
   climate-related hazards and that such impacts are projected to increase
   in the years and decades to come. Findings indicate that while a
   substantial-and growing-body of scientific evidence on coastal risks and
   potential adaptation options is acting as a stimulus for port
   authorities to explicitly consider the risks for their assets and
   operations, only a notable few have actually made the next step toward
   implementing adaptation strategies. This paper concludes by putting
   forward constructive recommendations for the sector and suggestions for
   research to address remaining knowledge gaps. It emphasizes a call for
   collaboration between the research and practice communities, as well as
   the need to engage a broad range of stakeholders in the adaptation
   planning process.

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise and climatic change threaten the existence of atoll
   nations. Inundation and erosion are expected to render islands
   uninhabitable over the next century, forcing human migration. Here we
   present analysis of shoreline change in all 101 islands in the Pacific
   atoll nation of Tuvalu. Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed
   over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at
   twice the global average (similar to 3.90 +/- 0.4 mm. yr(-1)). Results
   highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9\%),
   despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls.
   Island change has lacked uniformity with 74\% increasing and 27\%
   decreasing in size. Results challenge perceptions of island loss,
   showing islands are dynamic features that will persist as sites for
   habitation over the next century, presenting alternate opportunities for
   adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and their
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {Social factors of malaria were examined using the case-study of malaria
   incidence in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has currently achieved eradication of
   malaria but as it is a small island, developing country, it is
   vulnerable to climate change threats. Therefore the social influences,
   host immunity, anti-malarial resistance, prosperity and travel, were
   investigated with particular reference to potential climate
   change-induced malaria. Development of immunity depends on the intensity
   and stability of transmission within the region. Although Sri Lanka
   recently eradicated malaria, it was previously considered a region of
   low to moderate transmission, with most individual inoculation resulting
   in infection and disease at all ages. Self-medication when unrequired is
   particularly significant in contributing to the global issue of
   anti-malarial resistance. Despite known drug resistance, distribution
   continues to be widespread due to low over-the-counter cost and rapid
   relief of symptoms. Poverty promotes transmission of malaria and in turn
   malaria impedes economic growth. Malaria imposes economic loss beyond
   direct medical costs and associated effects to macroenomic costs by
   impacts on worker productivity, school children performance, etc.
   However improved economic growth is insufficient to eradicate malaria
   e.g. Oman. Air travel is a vital factor in malaria transmission due to
   conveyance of asymptomatic carriers from endemic to non-endemic
   countries, leading to outbreaks of epidemic malaria. Incidence of
   imported malaria has been observed mainly due to lapse or absence of
   prophylaxis. The management of malaria was examined under the categories
   of public healthcare services and mitigation measures. Mitigation
   measures were evaluated in relation to social factors, to determine
   their efficacy in the event of resurgent malaria. Mitigation techniques
   of prominence were anti-malarial therapy, Indoor Residual Spraying,
   Insecticide Treated Nets and Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets and
   lastly environmental management. Malaria is borne out of multiple risks;
   both environmental (i.e. climate change and environmental degradation)
   and social (i.e. anti-malarial resistance, migration and poverty). As
   observed in Sri Lanka, strong political commitment in prioritising
   malaria control with sustained resource allocation is vital to eliminate
   malaria. A multi-measure approach cross cutting public health care
   services and malaria interventions has proven effective despite some
   evident climate change impacts. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Tourists' representations of coastal managed realignment as a climate
   change adaptation strategy},
Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {182-192},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In coastal destinations climate change adaptation is needed to address
   coastal erosion due to a combination of sea level rise and more frequent
   extreme weather events leading to loss of natural features and tourism
   infrastructure. Managed realignment is increasingly adopted as a
   strategy to address coastal change; however, this has often proved a
   contentious strategy with stakeholder groups. This study explores
   tourists' representational framework of managed realignment and how this
   frames understanding of the concept, understanding of how coastal
   resources might change and implications for future visitation. Data
   compiled using a questionnaire adopted a social representations theory
   perspective to analyse how collective tourists' ideas may serve to
   mobilise the public in various ways. In general tourists have a poor
   understanding of managed realignment anchored to historic coastal
   management strategies and contextualised by use values with consequent
   implications for tourism planning and coastal management decision
   making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Environmental change in the Canadian Arctic has implications for
   livelihoods, food systems, infrastructure and Inuit culture. Although
   Inuit communities are located in industrialized countries, their
   integral connections with the natural environments contribute to
   significant exposures and sensitivities to changing conditions. This
   paper characterizes the vulnerability of Tuktoyaktuk in the western
   Canadian Arctic to climate change in the context of ongoing
   socio-economic and environmental changes. Existing stresses in the
   community influence infrastructure, livelihoods and wellbeing.
   Strategies for adapting to adverse conditions have largely been tactical
   and short term, rather than planned actions in anticipation of changes
   in climate. In light of projected intensification of climate change and
   a proposed natural gas pipeline in the Tuktoyaktuk area, the community
   is expected to experience new stresses in the future. Future adaptation
   planning and policy needs to enable community involvement in the
   protection of important community attributes.},

   Underwater Acoustic Communications Networks: A Cross-Layer Approach},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {44150-44164},
Abstract = {Interest in the study of next-generation underwater sensor networks for
   ocean investigation has increased owing to developing concerns over its
   utilization in areas, such as oceanography, commercial operations in
   maritime areas, and military surveillance. The underwater base station
   controller, in the form of a surface buoy, communicates with underwater
   base stations (UBSs) while the UBSs transceiver information with
   underwater sensor nodes via acoustic communications. This paper provides
   a link-level and system-level study of downlinks using an orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple access techniques for underwater acoustic
   communications (UAC) networks. We present an approach to
   link-level-to-system-level (L2S) mapping at the link level that provides
   an abstraction model of the link-level performance to be accessed by
   system-level simulation (SLS). In this paper, an exponential effective
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mapping (EESM) method is adopted, which
   elaborates on how multi-state channels are integrated into a single
   state in an SLS, and why an effective SNR can represent the
   characteristics of a multiple subcarrier SNR. Moreover, we explain the
   beta calibration procedure in detail for a UAC network. The simulation
   results are provided to verify the beta calibration of the UAC network.
   Furthermore, we employ a link adaptation strategy by evaluating system
   throughput based on a proportional fair (PF) scheduler at the system
   level. Hence, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of link
   adaptation strategy for UAC networks.},

Title = {The impact of climate change on the economic perspectives of crop
   farming in Pakistan: Using the ricardian model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {308},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Climate change may have detrimental effects on income from crop farming
   in Pakistan and according to the IPCC (2014), the impacts of climate
   change will be more vigorous in the coming years. Despite a few studies
   we still have limited knowledge on how climate change can impact the
   crop farming economy in Pakistan. Considering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)
   province of Pakistan as the study area, we attempted to fill this gap by
   analyzing the economic impacts of climate change on the net income from
   crop farming. Data from the 635 farm households and also climatic
   variables data were collected from five agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of
   the KP. The Ricardian method was employed for analysis purposes. The
   results revealed that the increase of annual average temperature and
   decreases in rainfall is strongly associated with net revenue deficits.
   The effects of increasing precipitation are observed to be useful but an
   increase in temperature is forecasted to be harmful to the net revenue.
   The effect of increased temperature in the summer season on NR ranged
   between US\$-29 to US\$35, and the effect in the winter season ranged
   between US\$-14 to US\$28 per hectare. The effect of decreased annual
   precipitation on NR in the summer season and winter season ranged
   between US\$ 0 to US\$-24 and US\$<-20 per hectare, respectively. This
   effect is particularly severe in the Central Valley Plains, Southern
   Piedmont Plains, and Western Dry Mountains. This study further evaluates
   the effects of the climatic forecasts by three Atmospheric Oceanic
   General Circulation Models (AOGCM). Our results will facilitate the
   policymakers to implement suitable strategies in KP to curb the
   deleterious effects of climate change on overall crop production and
   farmer income.},

Abstract = {Climate change and disaster risk are serious concerns considering the
   vulnerability of coastal areas and cities to various climate-disaster
   threats. Hence, the urban populace and planning stakeholders are
   grappling with the challenges of seeking ways to integrate adaptation
   measures into human livelihoods and planning systems. However, the
   synergy between climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk
   reduction (DRR) remains fragmented and vague. Therefore, this review
   highlighted recent theoretical and practical methodologies for
   sustainable planning outcomes in relation to CCA and DRR themes. This
   paper provides a new model, Problem analysis model (PAM), designed to
   analyse Origin-Cause-Effect (impacts)-Risks identification and Answers
   to climate-related disaster at the local or community level. Lastly,
   three identified enablers were extensively discussed (policy, programme
   and practice) as a step towards the model implementation and to improve
   sustainable planning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Understanding long-term trends of wave climate is important to establish
   proper mitigation and adaptation strategies for possible coastal erosion
   and loss of safety in maritime structure due to climate change. In this
   study, a 36-year (from 1979 to 2014) wave hindcasting was carried out
   and detailed analysis was made to recognize long-term changes in coastal
   wave climate of Korea. The reanalysis wind data provided by ECMWF are
   applied to the simulation of wave fields over sea waters around Korea.
   The SWAN model was used to obtain the wave fields from the longitude 120
   degrees to 150 degrees East and from the latitude 22.4 degrees to 47.6
   degrees North with a grid resolution of 1/12 degrees by 1/12 degrees.
   Comparison of the hindcasted waves with available wave observation data
   shows that the simulated wave field agrees fairly well with the
   observation although extreme values of the significant wave height are
   slightly underestimated. On average, the annual average and maximum
   values of the significant wave height showed increasing trend along the
   coasts of Korea.},

Journal = {SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {787-806},

Abstract = {Although many studies have examined the effects of structural factors
   and institutional interests on risk estimation practices, little is
   known about the political dynamics surrounding divergent responses to
   risk reduction measures. This article examines the political economy of
   risk reduction, using a case study of Louisiana's coastal restoration
   planning and decision-making process. Specifically, the article draws on
   documentary evidence, long-term ethnographic field observations, and
   semistructured interviews to investigate the proliferation of risk
   conflicts and disputes surrounding the 2012 Louisiana Comprehensive
   Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast, the latest long-term risk-reduction
   plan to slow coastal erosion and achieve a sustainable coast. As I point
   out, coastal restoration in Louisiana is contested terrain where a
   variety of contentious groups struggle to influence and control debates
   over climate change risk and coastal erosion risk reduction. By
   examining the proliferation of contested risk definitions and risk
   reduction strategies in Louisiana, I aim to provide new insight into the
   organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on risk,
   the political-economic forces that create and allocate risk, and the
   social construction of community identity and culture through risk
   debates.},

Abstract = {Climate change is producing more extremes and increasing the number and
   magnitude of risks that impact people's lives, so identifying and
   understanding local climate risks is a long but essential process for
   defining adaptation strategies. The availability of technologies to
   sensitize and educate people about risks, and to assist people with
   becoming active observers and monitors of climatic elements has helped
   to promote permanent surveillance and proactive attitudes towards
   climatic phenomena that lead to undesirable risks. This paper proposes a
   methodological approach to guide citizens moving around the city when
   extreme temperatures occur, minimizing climatic risks and negative
   health comes, using a very simple method based on Landsat 8 temperature
   data images at a subsection spatial scale level. The results obtained
   indicate the places of higher extreme temperatures risks, as well as
   some of the potential places that people can use to protect themselves.
   This work demonstrates the value of mapping climatic factors at a local
   scale and deliver tailored and accurate maps with the places suitable
   for alleviating bioclimatic stresses and the places that should be
   avoided.},

Abstract = {Climate change analysis is essential, considering the numerous economic
   and ecological implications of this critical global environmental issue.
   This paper analyzes the spatial and temporal trends of mean air
   temperature in Romania's most important agricultural area, the south and
   south-eastern region, between 1961 and 2009. In this respect,
   multiannual (the entire period) and multidecadal (1961-1990, 1971-2000,
   1981-2009) trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's
   slope method at 23 weather stations, annually, seasonally and for the
   growing season of the region's main agricultural crops (maize and
   wheat). Multiannually, the results showed statistically significant
   temperature increases, on all temporal scales (maximum rate of 0.06 A
   degrees C/year recorded in summer, equivalent to a net temperature rise
   of 2.82 A degrees C), except for the autumn season (cooling without
   statistical significance). Multidecadally, the 1961-1990 period is
   marked by a general cooling, especially in autumn (maximum values of
   -0.07 A degrees C/year or over 2 A degrees C net cooling). In the
   1971-2000 and 1981-2009 periods, a general warming was observed (maximum
   in summer for both multidecades, when positive rates peaked at 0.09 A
   degrees C/year, or 2.5-3 A degrees C net warming), but the warming of
   the last three decades is the most prominent in terms of spatial average
   magnitude and trend significance. Upon analysis of the impact of climate
   warming on agricultural yields (maize) through linear regression, in the
   1991-2000 decade, considered as case study, it was found that in 32 \%
   of the total analyzed area there are evident relationships between the
   two variables (p value < 0.05). In this case, a dependency of 33-50 \%
   (40 \%, on average) of maize to climate was found, and a sensitivity
   (loss) ranging between 0.9 and 1.5 t/ha/year (1.2 t/ha/year, on average)
   for a 1 A degrees C temperature rise. At the same time, significant
   losses (of up to 1.7 t/ha/year) of maize for a 1 A degrees C temperature
   rise were identified in 51 \% of the area, but with little p value
   significance (between 0.05 and 0.1). It is however necessary to analyse
   the agro-climatic results cautiously, considering that only one decade
   of climate-agriculture relationship was studied. The results can be
   useful first and foremost for mitigating the climate change impact on
   agricultural systems, by prioritizing future adaptation strategies
   enforced by policy makers.},

Title = {A framework for agenda-setting ocean acidification through boundary work},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {28-37},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is already impacting marine organisms and may
   fundamentally alter marine ecosystems in the coming decades, with major
   implications for ocean services, such as food provision. Though OA is an
   emerging concern in coastal zone management, current actions are limited
   to monitoring and knowledge production. This article presents a
   framework for addressing coastal zone OA in local-level policy agendas
   through workshops, and lessons learned and outcome from the
   implementation of this framework in two cases in southern and northern
   Norway. The framework includes four components: 1) facilitating
   knowledge exchange and identify challenges and opportunities relating to
   OA; 2) ensuring legitimacy of new knowledges; 3) building capacity
   through learning and skill development; and 4) raise awareness about OA
   among local decisionmakers. The case studies include local and regional
   coastal zone management stakeholders and, using OA measurements and
   modelling, illustrate co-production of new knowledge of coastal ocean
   acidification and its potential local impacts. Through two rounds of
   workshops, we demonstrate that the level of OA awareness markedly
   increases among stakeholders. This awareness manifests in vocal interest
   for looming projected impacts and their necessary mitigative measures.
   This concern is compounded by stakeholders who recognize that OA should
   be treated as a component of water-quality, implying that OA is gaining
   salience as a local policy issue. However, it is evident that local
   management faces challenges in addressing such an issue, combined with
   expectations that higher levels of government take responsibility for
   mitigative and adaptive actions in response to OA.},

Title = {Market-based instruments for flood risk management: A review of theory,
   practice and perspectives for climate adaptation policy},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {227-242},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change creates challenges for developments in coastal and delta
   areas. The risks are reduced more effectively if both planned and
   autonomous adaptations take place. Flood risk management is dominated by
   planned adaptation, which is primarily command-and-control in nature,
   e.g. spatial planning and engineered flood defenses. If autonomous
   adaptation is downplayed people are more likely to make land-use choices
   that collectively lead to increasing flood risks while leaving the costs
   of adaptation and land scarcity with governments. Unless governments
   provide stimuli, autonomous adaptation in flood-prone areas is unlikely
   to happen due to spatial externalities, path-dependency and time lag
   between private investment decisions and consequences. This paper
   reviews the theory and practice of using market-based instruments (MBIs)
   for flood-risk management as means for autonomous climate change
   adaptation. While the use of MBIs for climate change mitigation is
   widely discussed, systematized reviews of various MBIs for climate
   change adaptation are rare. Yet, international experience shows that
   such measures as preferential taxes, non-perverse subsidies, flood
   insurance, marketable permits and transferable development rights can
   engage local stakeholders and provide price signals that stimulate
   individual adaptation. MBIs combined with command-based instruments help
   policy-makers to guide developments in flood-prone zone by affecting
   individual behavior via market forces. As adverse consequences of
   climate change become more pronounced locally, quantity-based MBIs
   unfeasible at present should become more attractive. Price-based MBIs
   that are currently employed could be designed to strategically account
   for increasing climate-induced flood and erosion probabilities in
   coastal and delta areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {High resolution temperature data for ecological research and management
   on the Southern Ocean Islands},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean Islands are globally significant conservation areas.
   Predicting how their terrestrial ecosystems will respond to current and
   forecast climate change is essential for their management and requires
   high-quality temperature data at fine spatial resolutions. Existing
   datasets are inadequate for this purpose. Remote-sensed land surface
   temperature (LST) observations, such as those collected by
   satellite-mounted spectroradiometers, can provide high-resolution,
   spatially-continuous data for isolated locations. These methods require
   a clear sightline to measure surface conditions, however, which can
   leave large data-gaps in temperature time series. Using a
   spatio-temporal gap-filling method applied to high-resolution (similar
   to 1 km) LST observations for 20 Southern Ocean Islands, we compiled a
   complete monthly temperature dataset for a 15-year period (2001-2015).
   We validated results using in situ measurements of microclimate
   temperature. Gap-filled temperature observations described the thermal
   heterogeneity of the region better than existing climatology datasets,
   particularly for islands with steep elevational gradients and strong
   prevailing winds. This dataset will be especially useful for terrestrial
   ecologists, conservation biologists, and for developing island-specific
   management and mitigation strategies for environmental change.},

Abstract = {INFORM Risk Index is a global indicator-based disaster risk assessment
   tool that combines hazards, exposure, vulnerability and lack of coping
   capacity indicators with the purpose to support humanitarian crisis
   management decisions considering the current climate and population. In
   this exploratory study, we extend the Index to include future climate
   change and population projections using RCP 8.5 climate projections of
   coastal flood, river flood and drought, and SSP3 and SSP5 population
   projections for the period 2036 to 2065. For the three hazards
   considered, annually 1.3 billion people (150\% increase), 1.8 billion
   people (249\% increase) and 1.5 billion people (197\% increase) in the
   mid-21st century are projected to be exposed under the 2015, SSP3 and
   SSP5 population estimates, respectively. Drought shows the highest
   exposure levels followed by river flood and then coastal flood, with
   some regional differences. The largest exposed population is projected
   in Asia, while the largest percent changes are projected in Africa and
   Oceania. Countries with largest current and projected risk including
   non-climatic factors are generally located in Africa, West and South
   Asia and Central America. An uncertainty analysis of the extended index
   shows that it is generally robust and not influenced by the
   methodological choices. The projected changes in risk and coping
   capacity (vulnerability) due to climate change are generally greater
   than those associated with population changes. Countries in Europe,
   Western and Northern Asia and Africa tend to show higher reduction
   levels in vulnerability (lack of coping capacity) required to nullify
   the adverse impacts of the projected amplified hazards and exposure. The
   required increase in coping capacity (decreased vulnerability) can
   inform decision-making processes on disaster risk reduction and
   adaptation options to maintain manageable risk levels at global and
   national scale. Overall, the extended INFORM Risk Index is a means to
   integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation policy
   agendas to create conditions for greater policy impact, more efficient
   use of resources and more effective action in protecting life,
   livelihoods and valuable assets.},

Title = {Adaptive flood risk management planning based on a comprehensive flood
   risk conceptualisation},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {845-864},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Densely populated deltas are so vulnerable to sea level rise and climate
   change that they cannot wait for global mitigation to become effective.
   The Netherlands therefore puts huge efforts in adaptation research and
   planning for the future, for example through the national research
   programme Knowledge for Climate and the Delta Programme for the
   Twenty-first century. Flood risk is one of the key issues addressed in
   both programmes. Adaptive management planning should rely on a sound
   ex-ante policy analysis which encompasses a future outlook, establishing
   whether a policy transition is required, an assessment of alternative
   flood risk management strategies, and their planning in anticipation
   without running the risk of regret of doing too little too late or too
   much too early. This endeavour, addressed as adaptive delta management,
   calls for new approaches, especially because of uncertainties about
   long-term future developments. For flood risk management, it also
   entails reconsideration of the underlying principles and of the
   application of portfolios of technical measures versus spatial planning
   and other policy instruments. To this end, we first developed a
   conceptualisation of flood risk which reconciles the different
   approaches of flood defence management practice and spatial planning
   practice in order to bridge the gap between these previously detached
   fields. Secondly, we looked abroad in order to be better able to reflect
   critically on a possible Dutch bias which could have resulted from many
   centuries of experience of successful adaptation to increasing flood
   risk, but which may no longer be sustainable into the future. In this
   paper, we explain the multiple conceptualisation of flood risk and argue
   that explicitly distinguishing exposure determinants as a new concept
   may help to bridge the gap between engineers and spatial planners,
   wherefore we show how their different conceptualisations influence the
   framing of the adaptation challenge. Also, we identify what the
   Netherlands may learn from neighbouring countries with a different
   framing of the future flood risk challenge.},

Title = {Essentials of Endorheic Basins and Lakes: A Review in the Context of
   Current and Future Water Resource Management and Mitigation Activities
   in Central Asia},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Endorheic basins (i.e., land-locked drainage networks) and their lakes
   can be highly sensitive to variations in climate and adverse
   anthropogenic activities, such as overexploitation of water resources.
   In this review paper, we provide a brief overview of one major endorheic
   basin on each continent, plus a number of endorheic basins in Central
   Asia (CA), a region where a large proportion of the land area is within
   this type of basin. We summarize the effects of (changing) climate
   drivers and land surface-atmosphere feedbacks on the water balance. For
   the CA region, we also discuss key anthropogenic activities, related
   water management approaches and their complex relationship with
   political and policy issues. In CA a substantial increase in irrigated
   agriculture coupled with negative climate change impacts have disrupted
   the fragile water balance for many endorheic basins and their lakes.
   Transboundary integrated land and water management approaches must be
   developed to facilitate adequate climate change adaptation and possible
   mitigation of the adverse anthropogenic influence on endorheic basins in
   CA. Suitable climate adaptation, mitigation and efficient natural
   resource management technologies and methods are available, and are
   developing fast. A number of these are discussed in the paper, but these
   technologies alone are not sufficient to address pressing water resource
   issues in CA. Food-water-energy nexus analyses demonstrate that
   transboundary endorheic basin management requires transformational
   changes with involvement of all key stakeholders. Regional programs,
   supported by local governments and international donors, which
   incorporate advanced adaptation technologies, water resource research
   and management capacity development, are essential for successful
   climate change adaptation efforts in CA. However, there is a need for an
   accelerated uptake of such programs, with an emphasis on unification of
   approaches, as the pressures resulting from climate change and
   aggravated by human mismanagement of natural water resources leave very
   little time for hesitation.},

Title = {Multi-hazard risk assessment of two Hong Kong districts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {311-323},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The assessment of multi-hazard risks in urban areas poses particular
   difficulties due to the different temporal and spatial scales of
   hazardous events, and the potential interactions between hazards and
   socio-economic fragilities. Yet this exercise is important, as
   identifying the spatial distribution and concentration of risks in urban
   areas helps determine where and how preventive and corrective actions
   can reduce levels of vulnerability and exposure of urban populations.
   This article presents the results of a GIS-based assessment of present
   day risk to socio-natural hazards in two socio-economically distinct
   districts of Hong Kong (PRC) by utilizing indicators to describe the
   hazards and vulnerabilities. Hong Kong is a densely populated coastal
   metropolis exposed to multiple intense and potentially overlapping
   hydro-meteorological hazards, including heat waves, typhoons, and
   landslides. Mapping hazards and vulnerabilities in this urban area helps
   to visualize the spatial distribution and concentrations of risk located
   throughout the city, and thereby facilitate the tailoring of measures
   that can reduce risk at the very local scale. This approach has the
   potential of providing city planners and policy makers with visual
   guidance in prioritizing risk management and adaptation actions with
   respect to current and future risks existing in specific parts of the
   city, taking into account more than one hazard at the time. We found
   that the two districts considered have comparable and distributed levels
   of risk being both exposed to multiple hazards and notwithstanding the
   socio-economic groups. However, elements of criticality are potentially
   more widespread in the less wealthy parts of the city. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {435-440},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Adaptive management can be a very useful tool for assessing and
   improving coastal ecological engineering restoration projects. A
   shoreline restoration project using ecological engineering approaches to
   mitigate coastal erosion was developed and implemented in 2003 at Loyola
   Beach, Baffin Bay, TX. The project incorporated riprap, fiber matting,
   geotextile, and vegetation as an alternative to conventional hard
   structures for erosion control. As part of the restoration expansion, a
   detailed evaluation of the previous project was completed at several
   levels, including the landscape, geotechnical design, environmental and
   ecological considerations, and social and economic factors. The findings
   indicated that the vegetation and its underlying geotechnical integrity
   have played an important role in erosion mitigation. Overall the project
   was successful in the protection of the shoreline and was shown to be
   more ecologically beneficial than other hard structures. Based on the
   preliminary success of the initial project, the restoration techniques
   were adapted for another beach extension to the west. The assessment did
   reveal some weaknesses in the original project design including the need
   for more substantial toe protection and periodic maintenance
   requirements. Based on these assessments, some additional new methods
   for the restoration extension were proposed and implemented. The broader
   applicability of this restoration approach outside the local region has
   been presented through several outreach activities and delivered to
   coastal planners and land owners throughout the Texas Coastal Bend and
   Northern Mexico. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Several highly effective fire-adaptive traits first evolved among modern
   plants during the mid-Cretaceous, in response to the widespread
   wildfires promoted by anomalously high atmospheric oxygen (O-2) and
   extreme temperatures. Serotiny, or long-term canopy seed storage, is a
   fire-adaptive strategy common among plants living in fire-prone areas
   today, but evidence of this strategy has been lacking from the fossil
   record. Deposits of abundant fossil charcoal from sedimentary
   successions of the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, record wildfires in the
   south polar regions (75 degrees-80 degrees S) during the mid-Cretaceous
   (ca. 99-90 Ma). Newly discovered fossil conifer reproductive structures
   were consistently associated with these charcoal-rich deposits. The
   morphology and internal anatomy as revealed by neutron tomography
   exhibit a range of serotiny-associated characters. Numerous related
   fossils from similar, contemporaneous deposits of the Northern
   Hemisphere suggest that serotiny was a key adaptive strategy during the
   high-fire world of the Cretaceous.},

Title = {Inuit vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climate change in
   Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},

Abstract = {Climate change is already being experienced in the Arctic with
   implications for ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.
   This paper argues that an assessment of community Vulnerability to
   climate change requires knowledge of past experience with climate
   conditions, responses to climatic variations, future climate change
   projections, and non-climate factors that influence people's
   Susceptibility and adaptive capacity. The paper documents and describes
   exposure sensitivities to climate change experienced in the community of
   Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories and the adaptive strategies employed.
   It is based on collaborative research involving semi-structured
   interviews, secondary Sources of information, and participant
   observations. In the context of subsistence hunting, changes in
   temperature, seasonal patterns (for example timing and nature of the
   spring melt), sea ice and wind dynamics, and weather variability have
   affected the health and availability of some species of wildlife
   important for subsistence and have exacerbated risks associated with
   hunting and travel. Inuit in Ulukhaktok are coping with these changes by
   taking extra precautions when travelling, shifting modes of
   transportation, travel routes and hunting areas to deal with changing
   trail conditions, switching species harvested, and supplementing their
   diet with store bought foods. Limited access to capital resources,
   changing levels of traditional knowledge and land skills, and Substance
   abuse were identified as key constraints to adaptation. The research
   demonstrates the need to consider the perspectives and experiences of
   local people for climate change research to have practical relevance to
   Arctic communities such as for the development and promotion of adaptive
   strategies.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world and a UNESCO
   World Heritage site. This area is populated by some of the world's
   poorest people characterized by low levels of socio-economic indicators.
   However, it is one of the richest areas in the world in terms of natural
   resources and biodiversity. Climate change is evident here and is one of
   the important drivers of migration, food insecurity and poverty in this
   area. The basic objective of our study is to assess the socio-economic
   impact of climate change and its implications for availability of
   natural resources, and thereby to understand the adaptation needs of the
   people. Climate change not only impacts agricultural productivity but
   also the occupational structure. The decline in food security and the
   lack of other developmental choices in the face of climate variability
   are a serious threat to the economic viability of population. We have
   used stratified sampling techniques for data collection at household
   level based on pre-designed questionnaires and focus group discussion.
   We have tried to analyze vulnerability based on LIFE framework and
   log-linear regression model, and suggest some adaptation strategies to
   reduce vulnerability.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change in small island developing states},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {133},
Number = {3},
Pages = {481-489},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) are among the first and worst
   affected by climate change. SIDS are thus also among the first to adapt,
   and as `early adaptors' can provide key lessons for adaptation efforts
   elsewhere. This article reviews the growing literature on climate
   change, adaptation and small island states. It first discusses migration
   - which increasingly is seen as part of adaptation rather than a failure
   to adapt. Mobility has long been part of island life, and remittances
   can for example fund adaptation measures back home. Yet, adaptation in
   situ is not as forthcoming as would be necessary. The article identifies
   different barriers to effective adaptation, and discusses them under
   three distinct but interrelated categories: perceptions and awareness,
   institutions, and (lack of) resources. For effective, sustainable and
   successful adaptation, we need to overcome these barriers, and in
   particular provide information and resources to the local level. With
   appropriate information and resources, island communities can take and
   implement informed decisions and successfully adapt to a changing
   climate - as they have adjusted to social and environmental changes in
   the past.},

Abstract = {Monitoring programs aimed at understanding the population trends of
   secretive marshbirds can be altered to benefit from the creative
   interplay between predictions, designs and models, and provide the
   template for doing so. Effective application of information to decision
   making typically requires integration of several types of information in
   a common framework, including ``found{''} data and retrospective
   studies, innovative sampling designs and the use of hierarchical data
   structures. Hierarchical and state-space modeling provide a unified
   modeling structure for such designs and data. These ideas are
   illustrated with the problem of investigating and mitigating the effects
   of climate change on secretive marshbirds in coastal North America. How
   both ecological theory and available data can be used to provide
   predictions about the impacts of regional and local climate changes on
   these avian communities are illustrated. Received 12 November 2009,

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},

Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1521-1538},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows are vital ecosystems in coastal zones worldwide, but
   are also under global threat. One of the major hurdles restricting the
   success of seagrass conservation and restoration is our limited
   understanding of ecological feedback mechanisms. In these ecosystems,
   multiple, self-reinforcing feedbacks can undermine conservation efforts
   by masking environmental impacts until the decline is precipitous, or
   alternatively they can inhibit seagrass recovery in spite of restoration
   efforts. However, no clear framework yet exists for identifying or
   dealing with feedbacks to improve the management of seagrass ecosystems.
   Here we review the causes and consequences of multiple feedbacks between
   seagrass and biotic and/or abiotic processes. We demonstrate how
   feedbacks have the potential to impose or reinforce regimes of either
   seagrass dominance or unvegetated substrate, and how the strength and
   importance of these feedbacks vary across environmental gradients.
   Although a myriad of feedbacks have now been identified, the
   co-occurrence and likely interaction among feedbacks has largely been
   overlooked to date due to difficulties in analysis and detection. Here
   we take a fundamental step forward by modelling the interactions among
   two distinct above-and belowground feedbacks to demonstrate that
   interacting feedbacks are likely to be important for ecosystem
   resilience. On this basis, we propose a five-step adaptive management
   plan to address feedback dynamics for effective conservation and
   restoration strategies. The management plan provides guidance to aid in
   the identification and prioritisation of likely feedbacks in different
   seagrass ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Regime shifts are abrupt changes between contrasting, persistent states
   of any complex system. The potential for their prediction in the ocean
   and possible management depends upon the characteristics of the regime
   shifts: their drivers (from anthropogenic to natural), scale (from the
   local to the basin) and potential for management action (from adaptation
   to mitigation). We present a conceptual framework that will enhance our
   ability to detect, predict and manage regime shifts in the ocean,
   illustrating our approach with three well-documented examples: the North
   Pacific, the North Sea and Caribbean coral reefs. We conclude that the
   ability to adapt to, or manage, regime shifts depends upon their
   uniqueness, our understanding of their causes and linkages among
   ecosystem components and our observational capabilities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is large uncertainty about the changing magnitude and occurrence
   of coastal flood events with sea-level rise; which poses significant
   challenges to adaptation planning. Recent decision-making employs
   flexible options that can be modified/adjusted over time to address
   uncertainty. This research analyses a real option based method for
   assessing adaptation investment timing under coastal flooding and
   sea-level rise. This method recognises and values the flexibility of
   waiting as an additional adaptation option under an uncertain future,
   that is, the key question concerns when the option is best implemented?
   Real options are applied using a test-case in Lymington (UK), a
   floodprone coastal town. Our findings show that the option value (i.e.,
   the net value of the overall benefit minus cost) grows with rising sea
   level to a maximum, which is the optimal time for the adaptation
   investment. The optimum investment time tends to occur at the same
   magnitude of sea-level rise (relative to 1990) across most sea-level
   rise scenarios for the same socio-economic scenario. Hence, monitoring
   sea-level rise provides important information to plan adaptation. The
   analysis provides an analytical framework on how and when to implement
   the adaptation option given the various future scenarios which can be
   developed further.},

Abstract = {A major future challenge and limiting factor for future water resource
   management and planning is climate change and drought conditions and
   their impact on agricultural water demand. Many models have targeted
   climate change predictions for temperature, rainfall, and
   evapotranspiration and have led to future estimation of water demand for
   agriculture. However, uncertainty and risk analysis are normally not
   considered in future water demand estimations. The main objective of
   this study is to quantify the impact of climate change on agricultural
   water demand and productivity and better understand the uncertainty and
   risk involved in using several Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation
   Models (AOGCMs) to predict future temperature and water demand.
   As a case study, the Zayandeh Rud basin, located in the central part of
   Iran, has been chosen because of its importance for agricultural and
   food security. The main growing and major crops are wheat, barley,
   sugar-beet and potato. Future temperatures have been retrieved from the
   IPCC database, which include AOGCMs climate change data sets. These data
   sets cover the whole world in a pixel-wise manner. Seven AOGCMs from the
   IPCC Third Assessment Report, including CCSR NIES, CGCM2, CSIRO MK2,
   ECHAM4 GFDL R30, HadCM3 and NCAR DOE PCM, with A2 emission scenario have
   been used to project the future temperatures for the study area for two
   different time periods (210-2039 and 2070-2099). According to the ranges
   of temperature resulted from these models, one thousand samples of
   temperature time series for these two periods are produced for
   uncertainty and risk analysis of water demand.
   Preliminary results indicated that there is a significant increase in
   future temperatures, especially for the second period, ranging from
   3-8.1 degrees C, 3.1-8.2 degrees C, 3-6.9 degrees C and 2.3-6.5 degrees
   C, respectively for the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and
   winter) compared to the base period (1971-2000). As a result, a volume
   of about 173 and 230 MCM/year will be required to meet the water
   demands, considering probabilities of 50\% and 25\% respectively for
   this period. Also, the responses of each crop to drought/increasing
   temperature are different; for example, potato is more tolerant for
   temperature variability. Finally, Considering the uncertainty of these
   climate models to estimate increasing temperature in future, adaptation
   strategies are required to mitigate the future impact of increasing
   future agricultural water demand (especially for the period of
   2070-2099).},

   Originally planned to evaluate storm surge barriers, the New York City
   Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) instead developed a process for
   government agencies and private stakeholders to adapt critical
   infrastructure in New York City to the effects of climate change. In its
   influential 2010 report, the NPCC ignored the literature documenting the
   lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina striking New Orleans in 2005. A
   report by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) sums up these
   lessons in 10 calls to action. An examination of the NPCC report
   suggests that half of these lessons have been learned and half have not.
   Essentially, the ASCE makes public safety, health, and welfare, not
   adapting critical infrastructure, its top priorities. The NPCC report
   fails to quantify the risks, does not address the question of an
   acceptable level of risk, and does not evaluate the consequences of
   severe coastal flooding. Although storm surge barriers have been found
   to be hydrologically and technically feasible, they are dismissed as
   mere contributions to the discussion that are not needed for at least
   the next several decades, despite the report's own accounting of the
   extreme uncertainty and possible effects of severe hurricanes and
   nor'easters. The NPCC report features Flexible Adaptation Pathways to
   plan and revise adaptation measures over time, which ignore the
   possibility of hedging strategies and the well-established precautionary
   principle. Without an engineering presence, the NPCC also overlooks
   consideration of lead times in planning major projects. It is concluded
   that the NPCC report is delaying regional measures against severe
   coastal flooding, discouraging hedging and the precautionary principle,
   and deterring adequate measures to protect public safety, health, and
   welfare.},

Title = {NITROUS OXIDE: SOURCES, SINKS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES},
Booktitle = {NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS RESEARCH PROGRESS},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {127-150},
Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potential greenhouse gas accounting for 6\% of
   the total greenhouse effect. Apart from global warming, this gas is also
   implicated In the catalytic destruction of ozone layer in the
   stratosphere which saves us from the onslaught of UV radiations. It has
   got a very high potential of thermal absorption (296 times as compared
   to CO2 on molecule to molecule basis) with several absorption bands
   between 7.7 to 17 mu M wavelength regions, and call stay in the
   atmosphere approximately for 114 years.
   N2O is produced in the sediments/soils during N transformation, mainly
   by the microbial processes of nitrification, denitrification,
   chemo-denitrification as well as fungal trans formations. Nitrification
   is the predominant N2O-producing process under moderately moist and warm
   conditions, while denitrification is predominantly a process under wet
   (anaerobic) conditions when NH4+ and NO3- are available in soil.
   According to the fourth assessment report of IPCC 2007, N2O emissions
   from both natural Sources like oceans, tropical soils (wet forests, dry
   savannas), and temperate soils (forests and grasslands) and
   anthropogenic sources (fertilized Cultivated soils, biomass burning,
   industrial sources, and cattle and feed lots) were estimated to be 17.7
   Tg N yr(-1). Among the anthropogenic sources, agriculture alone accounts
   for 70 per cent of N2O emissions derived from nitrogen-rich fertilizers
   added to soils to maximize crop yields.
   The major sink for N2O is photo dissociation by Sunlight in the
   stratosphere. The Current estimate for stratospheric removal of N2O,
   based on stratospheric chemistry modeling, is about 12.6 Tg N/yr. Apart
   from this, there is also some evidence which suggests N2O removal by
   certain soils.
   The spatial and temporal variability of N2O fluxes from the soils are
   governed by a number of factors that affect the equilibrium of N
   transformation in soils. These are N content, organic matter, moisture,
   pH, aeration, temperature, soil compaction, nitrifying or denitrifying
   bacteria, texture, metals and crop management factors like presence of
   floodwater, application of N and N-inhibitors, presence of crops,
   tillage operations, soil fumigation, pesticide application, mulching,
   liming and natural forcing like freezing and thawing.
   Emission of N2O from soil results in decline of added and residual soil
   N, which is indeed an economic loss. Increasing the efficiency of the
   use of nitrogen supplied is one way by which agriculture may reduce
   nitrous oxide emissions. In general, agricultural N2O emissions can be
   decreased through N-management practices that (1) optimize the crop's
   natural ability to compete with processes whereby plant available N is
   lost from the soil-plant system (i.e., denitrification and leaching),
   (2) direct lowering of rate and duration of these loss processes;
   however, these simple principles may not be easily accomplished. (3)The
   use of nitrification inhibitors (DCD, DCS, DMPP, AM, ATS etc.) also
   helps in cutting down the emission of N2O from agricultural soils.
   Nitrification inhibitors retard the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate
   either by inhibiting or interfering with the metabolism of nitrifying
   bacteria. (4) The frequency, timing and placement of fertilizer use
   could also assist in increasing nitrogen use efficiency. (5) The use of
   rotations with legume crops is also an important method to reduce
   reliance on external N inputs, although legume-derived N can also be a
   source of N2O. (6) Besides, change in cultural processes may also
   mitigate N2O emission by enhancing N-use efficiency.
   Although use of nitrification inhibitors is not yet in practice in
   India, but they are widely used by the crop growers in USA, Japan,
   Germany etc. Such practice not only reduces N2O emission, but also
   enhances N-use efficiency and reduces NO3- leaching to ground and
   surface water. Hence, it is imperative to use such techniques for both
   better crop yield and environment.},

Abstract = {Cumulative and synergistic impacts from environmental pressures,
   particularly in low-lying tropical coastal regions, present challenges
   for the governance of ecosystems, which provide natural resource-based
   livelihoods for communities. Here, we seek to understand the
   relationship between responses to the impacts of El Nino and La Nina
   events and the vulnerability of mangrove-dependent communities in the
   Caribbean region of Colombia. Using two case study sites, we show how
   communities are impacted by, and undertake reactive short-term responses
   to, El Nino and La Nina events, and how such responses can affect their
   adaptive capacity to progressive environmental deterioration. We show
   that certain coping measures to climate variability currently deliver
   maladaptive outcomes, resulting in circumstances that could contribute
   to system `lock-in' and engender undesirable ecological states,
   exacerbating future livelihood vulnerabilities. We highlight the
   significant role of social barriers on vulnerabilities within the
   region, including perceptions of state abandonment, mistrust and
   conflicts with authorities. Opportunities to reduce vulnerability
   include enhancing the communities' capacity to adopt more positive and
   preventative responses based on demonstrable experiential learning
   capacity. However, these will require close cooperation between formal
   and informal organisations at different levels, and the development of
   shared coherent adaptation strategies to manage the complexity of
   multiple interacting environmental and climatic pressures.},

Title = {The interacting effects of storm surge intensification and sea-level
   rise on coastal resiliency: a high-resolution turbulence resolving case
   study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Climate change and global warming will increase the risk of coastal
   floods and storm surges, which can highly jeopardize communities and
   infrastructures along shorelines. There are two main drivers for this
   increase: surge amplification, which is caused by the projected
   hurricane intensification, and global sea-level rise (SLR). Although
   both factors can simultaneously affect storm surges, current knowledge
   on their interacting effects on the resiliency of coastal infrastructure
   is limited. To address this knowledge gap, we investigate the impacts of
   multiple storm surge scenarios on vehicles and buildings by varying wave
   heights, periods, and sea levels under current mitigation strategies.
   These surges are highly turbulent due to their high speed and
   wave-wave/bathymetry interactions. Large-scale numerical simulations
   with low-resolution (similar to 1-5 km) and depth-integrated models that
   do not resolve turbulence cannot assess the thorough impacts of these
   storm surges on infrastructures accurately. Hence, we employ a
   high-resolution numerical approach that is capable of resolving
   turbulent eddies down to similar to 3 cm and capturing fluid-structure
   interactions. The distribution of hydrodynamic loads is found to vary
   nonlinearly in all directions with surge amplification and can
   significantly exceed calculations from classical theories that neglect
   turbulence. Two approaches from previous experiments are employed in a
   novel way to evaluate the resiliency of vehicles and infrastructure
   during storm surges. Our results indicate that vehicle mobility on the
   considered road will be imperiled by moderate surges (4 m wave height),
   and the elevated building will fail by surge intensification (8 m
   waves). We found that some storm-surge wave heights that are relatively
   safe now (e.g., 2 m waves for vehicles and 6 m for the building) will
   become hazardous in the future with an SLR. Therefore, road and building
   safety regulations should account for the interacting effects of
   hurricane intensification and SLR when devising mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Assessment of Habitat Suitability for Common Cockles in the Ria the
   Aveiro Lagoon Under Average and Projected Environmental Conditions},
Journal = {ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
Abstract = {The common cockle Cerastoderma edule is a widespread bivalve species
   inhabiting estuarine systems across the North East Atlantic, where it
   provides several ecosystem services, and represents a valuable fishery
   resource for local economies. However, anthropogenic pressure and more
   frequent extreme weather events threaten the resilience of the species.
   Spatially explicit information on species distribution is critical for
   the implementation of management and conservation practices. This study
   assessed the potential distribution of C. edule in the Ria de Aveiro by
   estimating the habitat suitability using an ensemble approach based on
   ecological niche modeling and recently developed hydrodynamic and water
   quality models to forecast both average and projected estuarine
   conditions. The models were developed for the summer of 2013 and spring
   of 2019 and potential range shifts in the species distribution were
   forecasted under projected environmental conditions: high and low
   estimates of freshwater discharge, a 2 degrees C increase in water
   temperature, and the combined effect of low freshwater discharge and
   increased water temperature. The results suggest that salinity, time of
   submersion, and current velocity play an important role in the
   distribution of cockles, and large areas were consistently classified
   with high habitat suitability. Increased freshwater discharge (both
   seasons) and low discharge coupled to increased temperature (spring)
   resulted in large decreases in suitable habitat. Conversely, low
   freshwater discharges and average (unchanged) temperatures increased the
   suitable habitat in the outermost regions of the Ria. The spatially
   explicit information provided contributes to a better understanding of
   the vulnerability of C. edule in the Ria de Aveiro to extreme weather
   events (e.g., droughts, river floods) and may support adaptive
   management strategies of the cockle fishery during these conditions.
   Moreover, this approach can be transferred to other estuarine ecosystems
   for which data describing the environmental conditions (e.g., derived
   from numerical models), and information about species presence are
   available (including data-poor species).},

Abstract = {The ability to make well-informed decisions about protective or adaptive
   strategies for sea level rise (SLR) is crucial for coastal communities.
   Reservoirs construction, as an important human activity around the
   world, has boom with increased economies and electricity demand. To
   updated its impacts on the SLR, we proposed an integrated model by
   considering different parameters relating to working volume of
   reservoir, seepage and siltation. The updated reservoir databases were
   built and used to estimate the potential impacts of reservoir
   construction on SLR from 1950 to 2038. The results show that reservoir
   construction has prevented an average increase of 16.2\% per year in the
   last 68 years compared with the monitored SLR. In addition, reservoir
   construction will still continue to compensate 19.1\% of the SLR in the
   future. This paper highlighted the consideration of the impacts of
   global, national, regional reservoir construction on the SLR.},

Abstract = {Infectious diseases are common in marine environments, but the effects
   of a changing climate on marine pathogens are not well understood. Here
   we review current knowledge about how the climate drives host-pathogen
   interactions and infectious disease outbreaks. Climate-related impacts
   on marine diseases are being documented in corals, shellfish, finfish,
   and humans; these impacts are less clearly linked for other organisms.
   Oceans and people are inextricably linked, and marine diseases can both
   directly and indirectly affect human health, livelihoods, and
   well-being. We recommend an adaptive management approach to better
   increase the resilience of ocean systems vulnerable to marine diseases
   in a changing climate. Land-based management methods of quarantining,
   culling, and vaccinating are not successful in the ocean; therefore,
   forecasting conditions that lead to outbreaks and designing
   tools/approaches to influence these conditions may be the best way to
   manage marine disease.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {615-635},
Abstract = {Climate change-related impacts have the capacity to substantially
   influence Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean.
   Currently, many SIDS are engaged in large-scale vulnerability
   assessments that aim to identify, analyse, and inform solutions to
   mitigate climate change-related impacts. Many of these assessments,
   while useful, place little emphasis on the local stakeholders'
   perceptions of climate change. One such Caribbean community impacted by
   climate-related change is Providence Island in Colombia. Using a
   vulnerability assessment framework (Marshall, P.A. et al. 2010. A
   framework for social adaptation to climate change: sustaining tropical
   coastal communities and industries. Gland: IUCN Publication Services),
   researchers interviewed island residents (N = 23) about their
   perceptions of climate change, impacts on the local environment, and how
   the island community may adapt. All interviews were transcribed and
   analysed using a priori and open coding to identify patterns of and
   relationships between stakeholders' responses. Results indicate that
   local perceptions of climate change are linked to (1) environmental
   knowledge, (2) environmental awareness, attitudes, and beliefs, and (3)
   perceptions of risk. Implications for local adaptive strategies,
   education, communication, and suggestions for engagement at the local
   level are discussed.},

Abstract = {The assessment of future flood risk presented considers three climate
   change scenarios (a 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C change in Global Mean
   Temperature by the 2050s and 2080s and a more extreme, but plausible
   future, the so-called H++ future), and three population growth
   projections (low, high and no growth). The analysis covers the whole of
   the UK (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) and the risks
   associated with coastal, fluvial, surface water and groundwater
   flooding. Eight individual Adaptation Measures (including spatial
   planning, flood defence, catchment storage) are used to construct five
   Adaptation Scenarios (including enhanced and reduced levels of
   adaptation ambition in comparison to present day). Future flood risks
   for a range of climate, population and adaptation combinations are
   assessed using the UK Future Flood Explorer. The analysis highlights
   that significant increases in flood risk are projected to occur as early
   as the 2020s; a finding that reinforces the need for urgent action. The
   analysis also highlights that to manage risk effectively under a 2 or 4
   degrees C future an enhanced whole system approach to adaptation is
   needed. This will require action by a broad range of stakeholders, from
   national level down to individual households and businesses.},

Title = {A comparison of alternative systems to catch and kill for mitigating
   unprovoked shark bite on bathers or surfers at ocean beaches},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {201},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Responses to unprovoked shark bite involve public policies and
   management approaches that contend with the needs of public safety and
   the responsibility to protect threatened species. In Australia
   (Queensland and New South Wales) and South Africa, methods that aim to
   capture and kill large sharks adjacent to popular beaches are a
   long-standing approach aimed at reducing the risk of shark bite. This
   paper reviews non-lethal alternatives to catch and kill methods, and
   suggests optimal conditions for non-lethal systems that will assist
   policy makers and beach authorities in choosing public safety responses
   that can be applied at the ocean beach scale. Deployment needs to be
   strategic with sufficient knowledge of their likely effectiveness under
   local conditions. At this stage we believe there is no single approach
   universally applicable to ocean beaches where unprovoked shark bite
   occurs, although well considered and locally appropriate mitigation
   measures can reduce risk.},

Abstract = {High penetration of renewable energy sources coupled with

   will result even more complex unit commitment problem solution using
   energy storage system scheduling for efficient load leveling. This paper
   employees an adaptive approach to load leveling problem using the
   Volterra integral dynamical models. The problem is formulated as
   solution of the Volterra integral equation of the first kind which is
   attacked using Taylor-collocation numerical method which has the
   second-order accuracy and enjoys self-regularization properties, which
   is associated with confidence levels of system demand. Also the CESTAC
   method is applied to find the optimal approximation, optimal error and
   optimal step of collocation method. This adaptive approach is suitable
   for energy storage optimization in real time. The efficiency of the
   proposed methodology is demonstrated on the Single Electricity Market of
   the Island of Ireland.},

Abstract = {Landslides are often a hazard to high-pressure gas transmission
   pipelines operating in hilly and mountainous terrain. Typical mitigation
   options include pipeline rerouting or removing the landslide from the
   pipeline, if possible. When rerouting or hazard removal is not a viable
   option due to terrain conditions or the size of the landslide loading
   the pipeline, directional bores can be used to place the pipeline
   beneath the active portion of the slope failure.
   As part of our study of the geotechnical viability of mitigation options
   for a pipeline impacted by coastal landslides, rerouting and landslide
   mitigation alternatives were fully investigated. Geologic interpretation
   of high-resolution, publicly available IfSAR and privately-flown LiDAR
   data were used to evaluate alternative routes around active and
   potentially active landslides. Geotechnical borings through the
   landslides ultimately provided Sufficient information supporting
   directional drilling beneath the active landslides as the most efficient
   alternative, returning the pipeline to full service.},

Abstract = {Following the recent 2014-2017 global coral bleaching event, managers
   are seeking interventions to promote long-term resilience beyond
   monitoring coral decline. Here, we applied a spatial approach to
   investigate one potential intervention, mapping areas where local
   management could build coral reef resilience using herbivore management.
   Although herbivore management is a top recommendation in
   resilience-based management, site-specific attributes are thought to
   affect its success, and thus strategizing placement and design of these
   areas are crucial. Using Marxan, we mapped and prioritized potential
   Herbivore Management Areas (HMAs), where herbivores are protected but
   other types of fishing are allowed, in the main Hawaiian Islands.
   Through four scenarios, we found multiple hotspots along the west coast
   of Hawai'i Island and around the islands of Moloka'i, Lana'i, Maui, and
   Kaho'olawe where HMAs may have the best chance for success based on
   habitat, ecologically critical areas, life history, and social
   considerations. We further analyzed top results and found that a subset
   of characteristics including habitat types, biomass of herbivore
   functional groups, and temperature variability were significantly
   different from surrounding areas and thus contain potential drivers for
   selection. This unique approach can serve as an example for coral reef
   management in Hawai'i, on other Pacific Islands, and beyond, as it
   provides practical guidance on how to apply a resilience-building tool
   at a local level, incorporating site-specific biological and
   socioeconomic considerations.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Pages = {379-393},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this study we utilize content analysis techniques to examine how the
   issue of global warming and climate change has been characterized during
   the period of 1992 through 2005 by the Houston Chronicle-the largest
   regional newspaper in the Texas coastal region. A total of 795 global
   warming and climate change news articles from the Houston Chronicle are
   collected, coded and analyzed. Data analyses are organized and presented
   with regard to issue salience, various issue attributes (issue image,
   scope, linkage, participant, proposed solution and responsible party),
   use of science, and scientific information sources cited in the news
   stories. We find that regional media attention to the global climate
   change issue generally increases over time and an overwhelming majority
   of the news articles view the issue as a harmful problem. However, given
   the scientific consensus that global warming will result in significant
   devastating climate change consequences to the coastal regions, there
   are still a fair number of news articles delivering mixed, undetermined,
   or even non-harmful messages. We also find that climate change is often
   discussed as a national or international-global issue, and frequently
   linked to a number of other public. issues rather than just being viewed
   as an environmental-ecological problem. Moreover;, we find that emphasis
   on issue solutions is placed more on mitigation strategies than on
   adaptation behaviors, and that both governmental and non-governmental
   actions and responsibilities are suggested for dealing with climate
   change. In addition, our findings indicate that the regional newspaper
   in Texas obtains scientific information on climate change primarily from
   academic institutions. Implications of our findings and recommendations
   for future research are discussed in the concluding section. (c) 2008

Title = {Modelling and mapping soil organic carbon stocks under future climate
   change in south-eastern Australia},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {405},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a key role in the sequestration of
   carbon that could otherwise be warming the atmosphere. Climate change
   including increased temperature and changed rainfall will greatly impact
   the global SOC cycle. There are still significant gaps in our knowledge
   of the size of the global SOC pool and how future climate will affect
   SOC stocks and flows in many parts of the world, including Australia. In
   this study, we used SOC data in a Digital Soil Mapping framework to
   predict current and future SOC stocks across the state of New South
   Wales (NSW) in south-eastern Australia. In the first phase of the study
   we estimated the current SOC stock using multiple linear regression
   (MLR) and random forest (RF) modelling, and in the second phase we
   projected the change of SOC stocks in the near future (2050s) and far
   future (2090s) under two Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios
   based on 25 global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model
   Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Our spatial modelling showed
   that estimated current SOC stocks in NSW decreased from east to west.
   Multi-GCM ensemble means suggested SOC stocks would decrease by
   7.6-12.9\% under SSP2-4.5 and 9.1-20.9\% under SSP5-8.5 across NSW under
   future climate. The extent of change in SOC stocks varied spatially with
   the largest mean decrease of SOC stocks occurring in the North Coast and
   South East (alpine) regions of NSW. Our findings can support
   decision-making in land management and climate change mitigation
   strategies in NSW at the regional level. Furthermore, the modelling
   methods can be applied to other areas where edaphic and landscape
   properties, land use, and climate data are available.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on the tourism sector of a Small Island
   Developing State: A case study for the Bahamas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study examines the direct and indirect impacts of climate change to
   the tourism sector on the islands of New Providence and adjacent
   Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The assessment was carried out by
   conducting a geospatial analysis of tourism establishments at risk using
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We combined the geospatial
   analysis with publicly available databases to assess the integrated
   climate-related impacts pertaining to a Small Island Developing State
   (SIDS) economy. Our study estimated that many tourism properties
   currently lie in a storm surge zone and the extent of properties at risk
   increases with a future scenario of a 1 m rise in sea level. While sea
   level rise (SLR) by itself only threatens a small number of properties,
   when combined with weak (Category 1), moderate (Category 3) and strong
   (Category 5) storms the resulting coastal flooding impacts 34\%, 69\%,
   and 83\% of the tourism infrastructure (hotels and resorts),
   respectively. In addition to flooding, properties are also susceptible
   to coastal erosion with 28\% of the total hotels and resorts on the two
   islands being situated within 0-50 m and 60\% of the tourism
   infrastructure within 0-100 m of the coastline. Considering the economic
   importance of the sector, the potential impacts on the tourism
   infrastructure will cause significant losses in revenue and employment
   for the two islands. Furthermore, the majority of the tourism on these
   islands is beach-based and visitor expenditures will decline due to
   their vulnerability. These losses will have far-reaching social-economic
   consequences for the Bahamas. Our findings reveal a need for integrated
   coastal zone management that incorporates tourism management strategies
   with adaptation measures to deal with climate change.},

   salmon smolt spring migration},

Abstract = {Changes in migration timing, resulting from the alteration in river
   continuity or the effect of climate change, can have major consequences
   on the population dynamics of diadromous fish. Forecasting the phenology
   of fish migration is thus critically important to implement management
   actions aimed at protecting fish during their migration. In this study,
   an 11-year monitoring survey of Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar)
   from the Ourthe River, Belgium, was analysed within a European Special
   Area of Conservation to improve the understanding of environment-induced
   spring migration. A logistic model was fitted to forecast smolt
   migration and to calculate phenological indicators for management, i.e.
   the onset, end, and duration of migration, while accounting for the
   influence of photoperiod, water temperature, and hydrological
   conditions. The results indicated that the photo-thermal units
   accumulated by smolts above a 7 degrees C temperature threshold was a
   relevant proxy to reflect the synergistic effect between temperature and
   photoperiod on smolt migration. After integrating the effect of river
   flow pulses, the model accurately explained the inter-annual changes in
   migration timing (R-2= 0.95). The model predictions provide decisive
   management information to identify sensitive periods during which
   mitigation measures (e.g. hydropower turbine shutdown, river discharge
   management) should be conducted to promote smolt survival. The model was
   used to predict phenological characteristics under future scenarios of
   climate change. The results suggest a joint effect of hydrological
   alterations and water warming. Temperature increases of 1-4 degrees C
   were associated with earlier initiation of migration, 6-51 days earlier,
   and spring flood events greatly influenced the duration of the migration
   period. Accordingly, the combined effects of human-induced modifications
   of the hydrological regimes and increasing temperatures could result in
   a mismatch between the smolt and favourable survival conditions in the
   marine environment.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have begun to tackle the social and cultural dimensions
   of perceiving and framing climate change. Scholars from geography and
   environmental psychology in particular have started to highlight the
   importance of so-called place-based approaches to studying regional and
   local framings of climate change. This paper stands in this tradition.
   It reports on findings derived from a nationwide survey of perceptions
   of and reactions to extreme weather events and interviews conducted with
   inhabitants of three islands in the coastal region of North Frisia
   (Germany). Coastal dwellers understand climate change through the lens
   of local and regional experiences of meteorological phenomena, seasonal
   changes, knowledge of the sea, and changes in local flora and fauna. Our
   detailed ecolinguistic analysis revealed six prevailing conceptual
   metaphors: Climate change is an enemy, preventing climate change is
   fight/war, climate change is punishment for human sins, climate change
   is overheating/heat, climate change is hot air/hoax and climate change
   is eco-dictatorship. These metaphors were used to make sense of climate
   change at the regional level and provide insights into place-based
   social and cultural conceptualisations of climate change. An
   understanding of these meanings should feed into developing more
   grounded climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in coastal
   regions.},

Title = {An Earth's Future Special Collection: Impacts of the coastal dynamics of

Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-9},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rising sea level represents a significant threat to coastal communities
   and ecosystems, including altered habitats and increased vulnerability
   to coastal storms and recurrent inundation. This threat is exemplified
   in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where low topography, marshes, and a
   prevalence of tropical storms have resulted in extensive coastal
   impacts. The ability to facilitate adaptation and mitigation measures
   relies, in part, on the development of robust predictive capabilities
   that incorporate complex biological processes with physical dynamics.
   Initiated in 2010, the 6-year Ecological Effects of Sea Level
   RiseNorthern Gulf of Mexico project applied a transdisciplinary science
   approach to develop a suite of integrated modeling platforms informed by
   empirical data that are capable of evaluating a range of climate change
   scenarios. This special issue highlights resultant integrated models
   focused on tidal hydrodynamics, shoreline morphology, oyster ecology,
   coastal wetland vulnerability, and storm surges that demonstrate the
   need for dynamic models to incorporate feedbacks among physical and
   biological processes in assessments of sea level rise effects on coastal
   systems. Effects are projected to be significant, spatially variable and
   nonlinear relative to sea level rise rates. Scenarios of higher sea
   level rise rates are projected to exceed thresholds of wetland
   sustainability, and many regions will experience enhanced storm surges.
   Influenced by an extensive collaborative stakeholder engagement process,
   these assessments on the coastal dynamics of sea level rise provide a
   strong foundation for resilience measures in the northern Gulf of Mexico
   and a transferable approach for application to other coastal regions
   throughout the world.},

Volume = {79},

Abstract = {Due in part to the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme
   weather events in Australia, emergency management has recently
   transitioned from a command-and-control civil defence structure to one
   promoting `shared responsibility' between government, businesses,
   non-government, communities and individuals. The objective is to enable
   communities to become disaster resilient as opposed to fortified against
   risk. In this paper, using a case study approach, we examine whether
   this national resilience approach has been effectively institutionalised
   at the local scale. To do this, we draw upon the knowledge of those
   working within the traditional emergency management and community
   service sectors to identify which factors influence the resilience of a
   community in the case study location and determine which stakeholder
   classes are considered responsible for developing and enhancing each
   factor. The results indicate that all three tiers of government are
   still seen to be largely responsible for the case study's disaster
   resilience; however, local community groups comprised of volunteers are
   also perceived to be largely responsible for disaster resilience despite
   obvious capacity and resourcing limitations.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion and storms represent a source of risk for settlements
   and infrastructure along the coast. At the same time, coastal natural
   assets, including landscape, are threatened by increasing development
   mainly driven by tourism. The Mediterranean coast is especially
   vulnerable to these processes, considering its high biological and
   cultural diversity. An additional challenge is represented by climate
   change, as it will force coastal communities to apply more or less
   drastic adaptation strategies. Coastal setbacks, used to protect coastal
   communities and infrastructure from storms and erosion, and to preserve
   coastal habitats and landscapes from degradation, is one of the main
   instruments suggested by the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone
   Management of the Barcelona Convention, entered into force on the 24 of
   March 2011. Its implementation has the potential to influence coastal
   policies in other regions, such as the neighbouring Black Sea.
   The CONSCIENCE project has formalized concepts and conducted specific
   studies to provide new tools for coastal erosion management practice.
   The objective of this paper is to present a synthesis of the research
   conducted into coastal setbacks for coastal erosion management and
   climate change adaptation. This is done by analysing the requirement of
   the Protocol, current processes and management practices in two case
   study areas (Costa Brava Bays in Spain and Danube Delta, in Romania) and
   the new challenges posed by climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to quantifying current and future
   city-wide flood risks to Ho Chi Minh City. Here urban planning scenarios
   linking urban development and climate change explore the main driving
   forces of future risk. According to the redefined role of urban
   environmental planning in times of climate change, spatial planning
   needs to go beyond traditional planning approaches to bring together,
   draw upon and integrate individual policies for urban adaptation
   strategies for land-use planning. Our initial research results highlight
   that the spatiotemporal processes of urban development, together with
   climate change, are the central driving forces for climate-related
   impacts. The influence of planned urban developments to the year 2025 on
   future flood risk is seen to be significantly greater than that of
   projected sea-level rise to the year 2100. These results aid local
   decision making in an effort to better understand the nature of future
   climate change risks to the city and to identify the main driver of
   urban exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Public Service Electric \& Gas of New Jersey is restoring approximately
   4050 ha of salt marsh along Delaware Bay, USA, to offset possible
   effects on fish populations in the Bay from their existing once-through
   cooling system. Planning for this effort started with addressing three
   questions: Do marshes contribute significantly to fish production? How
   much marsh produces how much fish? Which marshes should be restored?
   There is ample evidence that salt marshes produce fish. The area of
   marsh necessary to offset potential losses was calculated from a simple
   aggregated food chain model and multiplied by four to provide a comfort
   level to the regulatory agencies. Marshes chosen for restoration were
   former salt marshes at appropriate tidal elevations. Planning involved
   experts in marsh ecology, hydrology, and engineering working with the
   company and regulatory agencies to establish clearly defined goals for
   the project. Design followed the advice of the experts and construction
   was overseen to follow the design. Long-term follow up is through
   adaptive management that is scheduled to Continue for about a decade,
   depending upon progress of the restoration toward its goals. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Climate change poses profound, direct, and well-documented threats to
   biodiversity. A significant fraction of Earth's species is at risk of
   extinction due to changing precipitation and temperature regimes, rising
   and acidifying oceans, and other factors. There is also growing
   awareness of the diversity and magnitude of responses, both proactive
   and reactive, that people will undertake as lives and livelihoods are
   affected by climate change. Yet to date few studies have examined the
   relationship between these two powerful forces. The natural systems upon
   which people depend, already under direct assault from climate change,
   are further threatened by how we respond to climate change. Human
   history and recent studies suggest that our actions to cope with climate
   change (adaptation) or lessen its rate and magnitude (mitigation) could
   have impacts that match-and even exceed-the direct effects of climate
   change on ecosystems. If we are to successfully conserve biodiversity
   and maintain ecosystem services in a warming world, considerable effort
   is needed to predict and reduce the indirect risks created by climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are crafting adaptation strategies to confront sea
   level rise (SLR). Unfortunately, cost-benefit analyses that assess SLR
   risks often fail to capture important political and social feedbacks.
   For example, adaptation measures (e.g., beach nourishment) can trigger
   greater development, undermining the value of adaptation infrastructure,
   incentivizing development, and increasing risks. We integrate diverse
   literature and data to develop a hypothesis and system dynamics model of
   coastal community responses to SLR. We apply the model to two U.S.
   communities, showing how political influence drives trajectories of
   infrastructure provision, cost, and vulnerability. We find that delayed
   feedbacks between perceived SLR risk and infrastructure investments
   mediate relationships between political capital, migration, and economic
   development. Community wealth and political influence may only delay the
   overshoot and collapse of its population and economy, as the virtuous
   cycles linking growth with infrastructure investment give way to vicious
   cycles of mounting infrastructure costs, political resistance to
   additional investment, and greater vulnerability. Copyright (c) 2018

Title = {Did adaptation strategies work? High fatalities from tropical cyclones

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1341-1355},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the fatalities from tropical cyclones (TC) generated
   in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea making landfall in India,
   Bangladesh, and neighboring countries. In these locations, the number of
   TC fatalities, on average, far outnumbers those found in the rest of the
   world. Applying negative binomial models, we find that TC fatalities are
   explained by high TC intensity, storm surge, and low income. A one unit
   increase in TC intensity (1 hpa) on TC fatality is commensurate with the
   effect of a one unit increase in income per capita (1000 INR). We also
   show that income growth reduces TC fatality, in part, because it
   increases adoption of information-based adaptation measures. Based on
   these results, future fatalities are projected based on forecasts from
   eight climate models and two income scenarios. A key result is the
   interplay between future increases in cyclone intensity versus income.
   If hurricane intensity were to increase, as predicted by three of the
   seven climate models, fatalities are predicted to increase dramatically
   in the low-income scenario. However, if income grows at a faster rate,
   hurricane fatality is predicted to fall in all scenarios. Therefore,
   economic development remains an important policy variable to mitigate
   future impacts from global warming.},

Abstract = {Maize, rice, wheat and soybean-the major staple food crops in China-have
   a crucial role in national food security and economic development.
   Predictions of changes in the requirements for irrigation water in food
   crop production under climate change may provide scientific support for
   the optimum allocation of water resources and measures to mitigate
   climate change. We conducted a spatial grid-based analysis using
   projections of future climate generated by a bias-correction and spatial
   disaggregation multi-model ensemble for three representative
   concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) adopted by
   the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We
   investigated the effects of climate change associated with increasing
   temperature, changed precipitation and increased concentrations of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on the irrigation water requirements of
   maize, rice, wheat and soybean in China at the end of the 21st century
   (2081-2100). Our results indicate that the irrigation water requirements
   of maize and wheat are driven by temperature and especially by CO2
   concentrations in the northwest interior area as a result of the low
   rainfall and high rates of evaporation; the irrigation water requirement
   of soybean is influenced by a combined effect of temperature,
   precipitation and CO2 concentration, whereas the irrigation water
   requirement for rice is dominated by precipitation alone in the southern
   coastal region, which has high rainfall. The irrigation water
   requirements of crops decrease mainly as a result of the beneficial
   effects of CO2 on plant growth in China. The regions requiring vast
   amounts of irrigation water as a result of climate change are mainly
   concentrated in northwestern China. The effects of climate change affect
   the requirement for irrigation water, especially under high-emission
   scenarios, and should be studied further to design appropriate
   adaptation strategies for the management of agricultural water to
   maintain the sustainable development of agriculture. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Evaluating the risk to Bangladeshi coastal infrastructure from tropical
   cyclones under climate change},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {In many countries, infrastructure plays a crucial role reducing losses
   during a cyclone. Bangladesh is already extremely vulnerable to tropical
   cyclones, and its infrastructure is frequently damaged by such events.
   However, climate change is expected to make the infrastructure itself,
   more vulnerable to cyclonic events in the future. This paper assesses
   the risk to coastal infrastructure in Bangladesh under climate change,
   from a multi-hazard perspective. A novel risk assessment matrix is
   proposed, examining the likely future risk to the country?s key
   infrastructure elements from six prioritised hazards. The hazards stem
   from changes to baseline climate, and from predictions of stronger
   cyclones as a result of climate change. We show that Bangladeshi
   infrastructure is extremely at risk, suggesting rapid action and
   mitigation measures are needed. Climate change will increase the
   vulnerability of infrastructure on its own, but higher storm surges
   related to intensified cyclones pose the greatest risk, with
   catastrophic impacts on all types of infrastructure. A number of
   recommendations to improve the infrastructure are made. Due to the
   severity of the risks, alternative measures to protect Bangladesh and
   its population should be considered. These may be natural defences,
   efficient evacuation procedures, integration of communities to the
   design and construction process, or relocation of populations. These
   measures may be more sustainable in the long term in a place with
   geophysical, geographical, social and financial contexts such as those
   found in Bangladesh.},

Title = {Threatening ``white gold{''}: Impacts of climate change on shrimp
   farming in coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {42-52},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In Bangladesh, tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) is commercially known as
   ``white gold{''}, because of its export value. However, the production
   of ``white gold{''} under shrimp alternate rice and shrimp-only farming
   systems in coastal Bangladesh has been accompanied by recent concerns
   over climate change. Field survey reveals that different climatic
   variables including coastal flooding, cyclone, sea-level rise, salinity,
   drought, rainfall, and sea surface temperature have had adverse effects
   on shrimp culture as well as socioeconomic conditions of farming
   households. There is also overwhelming evidence that changes in climatic
   variables has detrimental effects on the ecosystem of shrimp farms, and
   thus, severe effects on survival, growth, and production of shrimp.
   Considering extreme vulnerability to the effects of climate change on
   shrimp farming, we propose that community based adaptation strategies
   and integrated coastal zone management are needed to cope with the
   challenges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Drivers, dynamics and impacts of changing Arctic coasts},
Journal = {NATURE REVIEWS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-54},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Arctic coasts are increasingly affected by erosion and flooding, owing
   to decreasing sea ice, thawing permafrost and rising sea levels. This
   Review examines the changes in Arctic coastal morphodynamics and
   discusses the broader impacts on Arctic systems.
   Arctic coasts are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including
   rising sea levels and the loss of permafrost, sea ice and glaciers.
   Assessing the influence of anthropogenic warming on Arctic coastal
   dynamics, however, is challenged by the limited availability of
   observational, oceanographic and environmental data. Yet, with the
   majority of permafrost coasts being erosive, coupled with projected
   intensification of erosion and flooding, understanding these changes is
   critical. In this Review, we describe the morphological diversity of
   Arctic coasts, discuss important drivers of coastal change, explain the
   specific sensitivity of Arctic coasts to climate change and provide an
   overview of pan-Arctic shoreline change and its multifaceted impacts.
   Arctic coastal changes impact the human environment by threatening
   coastal settlements, infrastructure, cultural sites and archaeological
   remains. Changing sediment fluxes also impact the natural environment
   through carbon, nutrient and pollutant release on a magnitude that
   remains difficult to predict. Increasing transdisciplinary and
   interdisciplinary collaboration efforts will build the foundation for
   identifying sustainable solutions and adaptation strategies to reduce
   future risks for those living on, working at and visiting the rapidly
   changing Arctic coast.},

Title = {Non-isothermal flow between heated building models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {204},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Urban Heat Island Effect describes the phenomenon that urban areas
   are typically warmer than the nearby rural areas, as the presence of the
   city causes an increase in air temperature. Increased temperatures in
   urban environments lead to increased discomfort, health problems, and
   higher cooling demands. It is therefore essential tobe able to predict
   the location where higher temperatures tend to occur and to propose
   mitigation strategies for such local hot-spots. In this study, we
   present flowfield and temperature measurements from the ETHZ/Empa
   Atmospheric Boundary Layer wind tunnel. Time-averaged Particle Image
   Velocimetry is used to examine the nonisothermal flow in two geometric
   configurations of a three-dimensional street canyon surrounded by a
   realistic city geometry. We investigate the effect of buoyancy by
   measuring at forced to mixed convection flow regimes with Richardson
   (Ri) numbers ranging from 0 to 1.09. The work differs from previous
   studies, in that a finitelength street canyon with heated surfaces is
   considered. This set-up results in an increasing flow rate that escapes
   the street canyon volume as the flow becomes increasingly
   buoyancy-driven. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) levels increase with
   increasing Ri as flow exiting the street canyon mixes with the
   freestream flow.},

Title = {Constructed Wetlands to Face Water Scarcity and Water Pollution Risks:
   Learning from Farmers' Perception in Alicante, Spain},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Treated wastewater is constantly produced and relatively unaffected by
   climatic conditions, while Constructed Wetlands (CWs) are recognized as
   green technology and a cost-effective alternative to improve treated
   wastewater quality standards. This paper analyses how farmers consider
   (1) treated wastewater to face water scarcity risk and (2) CW as
   mechanisms to face agricultural water pollution in a climate change
   adaptation context. A survey about climate change perception and
   adaptation measures was answered by 177 farmers from two irrigation
   communities near El Hondo coastal wetland and the Santa Pola
   saltmarshes, both perceived as natural-constructed systems in Alicante,
   southern Spain. Results highlighted how, even with poor-quality
   standards, treated wastewater is considered a non-riskier measure and
   more reliable option when addressing climate change impacts. Overall,
   physical water harvesting (such as CWs) is the favorite choice when
   investing in water technologies, being perceived as the best option for
   users of treated wastewater and those concerned about water quality
   standards. Consequently, CWs were recognized as mechanisms to increase
   water supply and reduce water pollution. Policy-makers and water
   managers can use these learnings from farmers' experience to identify
   the main barriers and benefits of using treated wastewater and CWs to
   address water scarcity and water pollution risks.},

Abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the economic damages of climate change usually
   are based on aggregate relationships linking average temperature change
   to loss in gross domestic product (GDP). However, there is a clear need
   for further detail in the regional and sectoral dimensions of impact
   assessments to design and prioritize adaptation strategies. New
   developments in regional climate modeling and physical-impact modeling
   in Europe allow a better exploration of those dimensions. This article
   quantifies the potential consequences of climate change in Europe in
   four market impact categories (agriculture, river floods, coastal areas,
   and tourism) and one nonmarket impact (human health). The methodology
   integrates a set of coherent, high-resolution climate change projections
   and physical models into an economic modeling framework. We find that if
   the climate of the 2080s were to occur today, the annual loss in
   household welfare in the European Union (EU) resulting from the four
   market impacts would range between 0.2-1\%. If the welfare loss is
   assumed to be constant over time, climate change may halve the EU's
   annual welfare growth. Scenarios with warmer temperatures and a higher
   rise in sea level result in more severe economic damage. However, the
   results show that there are large variations across European regions.
   Southern Europe, the British Isles, and Central Europe North appear most
   sensitive to climate change. Northern Europe, on the other hand, is the
   only region with net economic benefits, driven mainly by the positive
   effects on agriculture. Coastal systems, agriculture, and river flooding
   are the most important of the four market impacts assessed.},

Abstract = {Shoreline recession due to the combined effect of waves, tides and sea
   level rise is increasingly becoming a major threat to beaches, one of
   the main assets of seaside tourist destinations. Given such an uncertain
   future climate and the climate-sensitive nature of many decisions that
   affect the long term, there is a growing need to shift current
   approaches towards probabilistic frameworks able to take uncertainty
   into account. This study contributes to climate change research by
   exploring the effects of erosion on the recreation value of beaches as a
   key indicator in the tourism sector. The new paradigm relates eroded
   sand to geographic and socioeconomic aspects and other physical
   settings, including beach type, quality and accesses, yielding monetary
   estimates of risk in probabilistic terms. Additionally, we look into
   policy implications regarding tourism management, adaptation and risk
   reduction. The methodology was implemented in 57 beaches in Asturias
   (north of Spain).},

Title = {Assessing the Climate Resilience of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): A
   Metric-Based Approach},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change have resulted in the emergence of
   resilience as the de factor framework for countries seeking to capture
   the differential and uneven ability to prepare, react, respond and cope
   with volatile and rapid changes of climate-related stresses. Despite
   being considered by many researchers the most vulnerable region to the
   negative effects of climate change, the climate resilience of
   Sub-Saharan Africa has not been extensively studied. Using countries in
   Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a study area, this paper constructed a
   pragmatically based resilience metric called the composite national
   climate resilience index (CNCRI) that can be used as a tool for the
   policy word. The inherent variables used to construct the CNCRI were
   justified and used to measure the resilience of countries in SSA based
   on five different dimensions. The result indicates that the CNCRI score,
   1.05 (least resilient) to 44.8 (most resilient), and the island
   countries of Mauritius, Seychelles, and Cape Verde are comparatively
   more resilient than the rest of the countries in the study area.
   Regionally, Southern Africa is more resilient compared to East, West,
   and Central Africa. The vulnerability and readiness metric suggested
   that Cape Verde is the only country in SSA to have low vulnerability and
   high readiness, while most countries have high vulnerability and low
   readiness, making them the least resilient countries needing urgent
   mitigation and adaptation actions. Lastly, finding from this study could
   provide the policy world with insight for improving the overall ability
   to prepare and respond to the negative impacts of climate in the study
   area.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Underwater detonations have the potential for serious injury in marine
   vertebrates such as fishes, reptiles, birds and mammals. The high
   detonation velocity creates a shock wave. The main reason for injury is
   the extremely short signal rise time combined with a high overpressure.
   A negative pressure phase generating cavitation shortly after the peak
   overpressure can increase organ and tissue damage. Due to surface
   reflection generating a reversed phase replica of the detonation, this
   phenomenon is very pronounced in shallow waters. Organs most seriously
   affected by detonations are those with gas/tissue interfaces (e.g.,
   ears, lungs, swim bladders, air sacs, intestines). Observed injuries
   include disruption of cells and tissues by differential displacement,
   internal bleeding, embolism, and auditory damage. Furthermore,
   compression of the thorax by the shock wave initiates a rapid increase
   in blood pressure, which can cause damage in the brain and ears. In
   order to protect marine life, all possible attempts should be made to
   avoid underwater detonations. For detonations that cannot be avoided due
   to safety considerations, a number of mitigation measures are presented
   including bubble curtains, scaring devices, visual and acoustic
   monitoring, and seasonal and spatial planning. However, mitigation
   measures have varying degrees of efficiency. Low-order detonations are
   not a real alternative due to the release of toxic munitions
   constituents to the environment. For each detonation, a proper site- and
   munitions-specific risk assessment and mitigation strategy must be
   developed.},

Abstract = {Floodgates or storm surge barriers are increasingly being considered as
   feasible climate change adaptation strategies to mitigate flooding risk.
   We developed a numerical modeling approach for a partially mixed estuary
   to simulate long-term alterations to hydrodynamics and transport
   processes induced from human modifications; two types of partially
   embanked storm surge barriers across the mouth of Chesapeake Bay were
   examined. Under modeled scenarios, surge barriers exerted a significant
   influence on the tide, salinity, residual current, and transport
   processes. The surge barrier caused (1) a reduction of tidal range
   inside the estuary, (2) stronger stratification and further salt
   intrusion, weaker vertical mixing and larger vertical exchange time, and
   (3) a decrease of bottom inflow in the mainstem and weakened horizontal
   water exchange. The change of horizontal water exchange and residence
   time was not a linear response with the barrier size and it varied at
   different regions of the estuary. The modeling approach is suitable to
   assess large-scale long-term ecosystem changes induced by human
   modifications or adaptations under a changing system.},

Abstract = {Adaptive maritime spatial planning (MSP) uses monitoring and evaluation
   of the effectiveness of spatial and temporal management measures to
   promote understanding and improve planning and decision-making. An
   adaptive approach to MSP involves exploring alternative ways to meet
   management objectives, predicting the outcomes of alternative management
   measures, implementing one or more of these alternative management
   measures, monitoring to learn about the effects of management measures,
   and then using the results to update knowledge and adjust management
   actions. A monitoring and evaluation plan should be designed to be both
   cost effective and comprehensive. The process of setting and assessing
   performance metrics requires that the ecological and socio-economic
   objectives of the spatial management plan must be clearly stated up
   front for management actions to reflect those objectives accurately. To
   evaluate the effectiveness of a MSP plan, a range of ecological,
   socio-economic and institutional indicators need to be developed and

Abstract = {Coastal communities living at the edge' face intensification and

   Communities will need to be adaptive in reducing these risks now and
   over long timeframes. Developing coastal hazard adaptation pathways
   requires co-production of interdisciplinary knowledge between
   scientists, policy makers and communities. However, there remains little
   guidance and limited dialogue about the research practices and
   frameworks that underpin co-created research. In a tirst for New
   Zealand, a co-created research programme is underway titled `Living at
   the Edge' that aims to improve the resilience of coastal communities to
   coastal hazards. This paper provides novel insights into the
   complexities underpinning the formative stages of co-created research,
   drawing on practical experience from the Living at the Edge project. We
   explore the enablers and shapers that led to co-created shifts in the
   research project objectives and framework. Notions of integration,
   trust, and flexibility are three fundamental aspects that influenced the
   early stages of co-creation. The importance of bridging interactions
   with actors early on in co-created projects is exemplified.},

Title = {Managing risk of non-indigenous species establishment associated with
   ballast water discharges from ships with bypassed or inoperable ballast
   water management systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Ballast water is recognized as a leading pathway for the introduction of
   aquatic non-indigenous species which have caused substantial ecological
   damage globally. Following international regulations, most international
   ships will install a ballast water management system (BWMS) by 2024 to
   limit the concentration of aquatic organisms in ballast water
   discharges; however, these new technologies may not operate as expected
   at global ports having variable water quality or may periodically
   malfunction. Using simulations informed by empirical data, we
   investigated the risk of non-indigenous species establishment associated
   with BWMS inoperability and evaluated potential mitigation strategies.
   Scenarios considered included bypassed or inoperable BWMS achieving no
   reduction in organisms, and partially functioning BWMS with discharged
   organism concentrations exceeding permissible limits. These scenarios
   were contrasted to outcomes with fully functioning BWMS and to voyages
   where ballast water exchange (BWE) was used to mitigate risk. Partially
   functioning BWMSs were nonetheless beneficial, reducing organism
   concentrations in ballast and thus establishment risk. When a BWMS is
   bypassed or partially functioning, BWE is a useful emergency mitigation
   measure, reducing establishment risks more than partial BMWS. However,
   the greatest risk reduction was achieved when partial BWMS and BWE were
   combined. Voyage-specific characteristics such as concentration of
   organisms at uptake and destination port salinity can affect the optimal
   management strategy for voyages when the BWMS does not achieve compliant
   discharges. Synthesis and applications. The risk of aquatic invasions
   and their associated ecological damages can be substantially reduced by
   using a ballast water management system (BWMS) and/or ballast water
   exchange (BWE). When a BWMS is inoperable, appropriate mitigation
   measures should be decided on a trip-by-trip basis considering voyage
   route and reason for BWMS inoperability (when known). BWE is a useful
   strategy for reducing invasion risk, except when uptake concentrations
   are very low. Combining BWE and partial BWMS always reduced risk
   compared with BWE alone, but did not greatly reduce risk when uptake

   Perceptions and adaptation options in Benin},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {166-180},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the local communities'
   perception of climate variation effects on crop production and the
   adopted strategies by farmers in order to cope with the negative effects
   of climate on the agriculture in the coastal zone of Benin.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 290 agricultural households
   were sampled and surveyed through structured interviews. The principal
   component analysis (PCA) was performed on the relative frequencies
   citation of perceived climate variation indication in order to describe
   the relationship between risk perceptions according to socio-demographic
   characteristics. The relative frequency of citation was calculated
   according to age, gender, ethnic group and agro-ecological region.
   Findings - Results showed that almost 83 per cent of the respondents
   already perceived the climate change risks through several indications.
   Climate variation perception varied with respect to age. Respondents'
   opinion regarding climate variation causes depended generally on their
   age, religion and level of education. As far as climate variation risks
   impact on crop production is concerned, the respondents' opinions
   diverged.
   Originality/value - The assessment of local communities' perception is
   important to design participatory and sustainable measures to cope with
   harmful effects of climate variation on crop production.},

Title = {Network analysis and characterization of vulnerability in flood control
   infrastructure for system-level risk reduction},
Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {89},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The number of catastrophic events such as extreme rainfalls and
   hurricanes has been growing. These events pose a major threat to the
   life safety and economic prosperity of urban regions. Flood control
   networks play a pivotal role in mitigating the risk associated with the
   stormwater generated by extreme rainfalls and hurricanes. The objective
   of this study is to propose a framework to examine the vulnerability in
   flood control infrastructure networks. This framework applies graph
   theory concepts and tools to define a vulnerability index for flood
   control network components (e.g., channels and rivers). The topological
   attributes of flood control networks are used to determine the
   vulnerability index based on structural attributes of flood control
   networks. First, a flood control network is modeled as a directed graph
   and storage facilities are incorporated into the network. Second,
   co-location exposure, upstream channel susceptibility, and discharge
   redundancy are characterized as important vulnerability attributes of a
   channel in flood control network. Then, these three characteristics are
   formulized based on the topological attributes of the network and
   characteristics of channels. The vulnerability index is then determined
   based on the three vulnerability characteristics. The proposed
   vulnerability index can be used to evaluate the impact of different risk
   reduction policies on flood control network vulnerability and determine
   the optimal mitigation strategies aiming at flood risk reduction, such
   as widening vulnerable channels, placement of storage facilities in the
   network or increasing the redundancy of the network. The framework is
   implemented on two watersheds in Harris County (Texas, USA) and the
   results' implications for decision-making in infrastructure management
   and hazard mitigation planning are discussed. The results highlight the
   capability of the proposed graph-based framework to inform flood risk
   reduction through evaluation of the vulnerability of infrastructure
   networks.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {725},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {The relationship between canopy urban heat islands (CUHIs) and surface
   urban heat islands (SUHIs) at four times daily temporal resolution
   remains unclear. The CUHI-SUHI relationship is investigated using four
   observations per day without temporal averaging in Shanghai, Beijing,
   Birmingham, and Taipei, with 201 of 2232 CUHISUHI pairs exhibiting
   significant UHI differences in their spatial distributions and
   intensities. These 201 UHI difference cases are determined by the
   correlation coefficients between air and surface temperature <0.2. The
   SPAtial EFficiency (SPAEF) multiple-component performance metric is
   applied to compare the spatiotemporal patterns of SUHIs derived from
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data and
   CUHIs acquired from either meteorological observations or numerical
   simulations. The results indicate that 81.09\% of the UHI differences
   occurred during the daytime, and were caused by local air advection
   related to wind speed >= 2 m/s and land surface conditions in the study
   areas. We conclude that joint analysis of CUHIs and SUHIs should be
   conducted to characterize urban thermal environments and that current
   urban planning procedures should integrate these UHI differences to
   develop effective mitigation strategies and adaptation measures. (C)

Title = {Cost-Benefit Analysis of Adaptation to Beach Loss Due to Climate Change
   in Japan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To measure economic effects of changes in environmental quality caused
   by climate change in Japan, we estimate beach loss damage costs in Japan
   and in each prefecture and evaluate the economic effectiveness of
   hypothetical adaptation measures to restore sandy beaches. For analyses,
   we use a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) that integrates a
   utility function with environmental quality factors as an independent
   variable derived from a recreation demand function in a travel cost
   method (TCM). We use future projections of beach loss rates in 2081-2100
   based on ensemble-mean regional sea-level rise (SLR) for four
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5,
   RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). The main findings of our study are presented as
   follows. (1) In 2081-2100, beach loss damage costs were estimated
   respectively as 398.54 million USD per year for RCP2.6, 468.96
   (m.USD/year) for RCP4.5, 494.09 (m.USD/year) for RCP6.0, and 654.63
   (m.USD/year) for RCP8.5. (2) For all RCPs, six prefectures for which the
   cost-benefit ratio exceeds 1.0 were Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo, Hiroshima,
   Saga, and Kumamoto. Our hypothetical adaptation measure of an artificial
   beach enhancement is expected to be quite effective as a public works
   project in these prefectures.},

Title = {Can adaptive co-management reduce poverty and inequality in the coastal
   fishing community? An impact evaluation in the riverine system in
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Adaptive co-management is an effective tool for reducing poverty among
   poor fishers who lives in the coastal fisheries. This approach can
   ensure the highest possible sustainable output from capture fisheries,
   increasing revenue and reducing inequality. Using household panel data
   from coastal areas of Bangladesh, this study assessed the impact of
   ECOFISH project's adaptive co-management approach on poverty, income and
   inequality through difference in differences (DiD) method. Using
   two-stage cluster sampling, data was collected from 1200 fishers'
   households of six coastal districts, which were separated into project
   and control groups. Poverty and inequality were measured using the
   Foster- Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) indices and Gini decomposition,
   respectively. In addition, a fixed-effect model was also employed to
   identify the factors influencing their income change. The findings from
   DiD reveal that the project had a positive impact on the fisher's
   income, especially in the case of fishing and on-farm sources. Due to
   the unconfined implementation in open-water fisheries, the study had
   minor effects on inequality. However, the adaptive co-management
   approach effectively reduced poverty among the fishers. Moreover, the
   intensity and severity of their poverty situation had significantly
   declined. The fixed-effect model elicited that ECOFISH has successfully
   increased fishing and total income, whereas the off-farm income was
   curtailed. The household head's age, size, fishing boat ownership,
   varied livelihood, social network, and household assets contributed to a
   considerable rise in overall income. This research could help
   policymakers in the food systems approach make better judgments on
   poverty reduction.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Using a resilience thinking approach to improve coastal governance
   responses to complexity and uncertainty: a Tasmanian case study,
   Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {253},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Conventional approaches to environmental governance and management are
   limited in their responses to uncertainty and complexity of
   social-ecological system (SES) change. Prevailing neoliberal and
   efficiency-based mindsets tend to focus on avoiding risk and creating
   ``fail-safe{''} systems. In the last decade, resilience thinking has
   emerged as a means to transition from risk-averse, and
   command-and-control governance approaches towards those that are more
   adaptive, innovative and collaborative. To examine the practical
   usefulness of a resilience thinking approach, we used a complex,
   multi-layered case study of Tasmanian coastal governance. Drawing on the
   diverse expertise and a variety of key governance actors, we identified
   crucial problems being experienced with the Tasmanian coastal governance
   regime and discussed potential contributions of resilience thinking to
   address them. Thematic analysis of the results revealed three major
   contributions: resilience thinking (1) provides a way to think about
   change and uncertainty; (2) is compatible with proactive and
   entrepreneurial leadership; and (3) effectively considers issues of
   scale in the decision-making process. We conclude by offering practical
   suggestions towards devolved leadership and improved cross-scale
   collaboration, and consider the possibility of a hybrid resilience and
   risk-based approach to coastal management and governance.},

Title = {The Impact of Cyclone Aila on the Sundarban Forest Ecosystem},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-97},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase stress on mangrove forests across
   the globe in multiple pathways. Changes in sea level, temperature,
   tropical cyclones, saline water invasion, land inundation, ocean
   acidification, invasive species due to climate change. Livelihoods of
   above hundred million people depending on mangrove forest ecosystem
   services, mostly living in developing countries will be severely
   affected due to climate change. The impacts of recently occurred
   tropical cyclone Aila (May 25, 2009) on Sundarban mangrove forest
   ecosystem in Bangladesh has been assessed in this research in order to
   understand the possible impacts of climate change induced extreme
   weather events on forest ecosystem services. Time series of satellite
   images, socio-economic census data, focus group discussions (FGD)
   outcomes, and other ancillary information have been analyzed for this
   purpose. The study revealed that cyclone Aila caused incremental
   stresses on the socioeconomic conditions of coastal communities through
   rendering huge areas of land unproductive for a long time, and in some
   cases forever. People who were dependent on land resources for their
   livelihoods were forced to change their livelihood on forest resources,
   which in turn caused increased pressure on already stressed forest
   resources. It is concluded that increasing frequency and severity of
   climate change induced extreme events will certainly increase pressure
   on forest ecosystem services, which eventually may pose threat of
   extinction to biodiversity of Sundarban mangrove forest, if necessary
   adaptation measures are not taken.},

Title = {Public understanding of climate change-related sea-level rise},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise resulting from climate change is impacting coasts around
   the planet. There is strong scientific consensus about the amount of
   sea-level rise to 2050 (0.24-0.32 m) and a range of projections to 2100,
   which vary depending on the approach used and the mitigation measures
   taken to reduce carbon emissions. Despite this strong scientific
   consensus regarding the reality of climate change-related sea-level
   rise, and the associated need to engage publics in adaptation and
   mitigation efforts, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding
   people's understanding of the issue. Here we investigate public
   understanding of the amount, rate and causes of sea-level rise. Data
   from a representative sample of New Zealand adults showed a suprising
   tendency for the public to overestimate the scientifically plausible
   amount of sea-level rise by 2100 and to identify melting sea ice as its
   primary causal mechanism. These findings will be valuable for scientists
   communicating about sea-level rise, communicators seeking to engage
   publics on the issue of sea-level rise, and media reporting on sea-level
   rise.},

Title = {Microbial Ecophysiology of Vibrio ruber},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {198-203},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Bacteria use different adaptation strategies to survive environmental
   perturbations. In this minireview, adaptation strategies of new
   red-pigmented Vibrio ruber isolated from coastal environments to
   different environmental stresses (i.e. salinity, viscosity, UV light,
   mitomycin C, nutrient availability and temperature) are reviewed. To
   cope with environmental stresses Vibrio ruber uses several different
   adaptive strategies. For example, lipid composition as well as phase
   behaviour are strongly dependent on salt concentration. Vibrio ruber
   membrane has no hydroxy fatty acids, but exceptionally high lysolipid
   content compared to other related Vibrio species. Inorganic nutrient
   uptake by bacteria is selective, depends on environmental conditions and
   varies several fold with environmental perturbations. Protein
   composition, carbon flow through the central metabolic pathways, energy
   generation as well as secondary metabolite production adapt readily to
   stress conditions. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
   proved to be a good indicator of Vibrio ruber stress. Cells are able to
   modulate their local viscosity in response to variations of
   environmental viscosity. The bacterium harbours several viral genetic
   elements in its genome, which could be induced by mitomycin C.
   Environmental conditions during growth of bacteria have a significant
   effect on lysate carbon turnover. Secondary metabolite prodigiosin
   confers protection against UV in the environment, which adds to the
   known repertoire of prodigiosin ecophysiological functions. In
   conclusion, Vibrio ruber in its short acquaintance with the scientific
   community (less than ten years) has proven to be an immensely valuable
   model system for ecophysiological studies of bacteria.},

Abstract = {Water scarcity can be defined as a lack of sufficient water resources or
   as the limited or even missing access to a safe water supply. Latter can
   be classified as `economic water scarcity' which among others can
   commonly be met in tropical and subtropical karst regions of emerging
   and developing countries. Karst aquifers, mostly consisting of limestone
   and carbonate rock, show high infiltration rates which leads to a lack
   of above ground storage possibilities. Thus, the water will drain
   rapidly into the underground and evolve vast river networks. Considering
   the lack of appropriate infrastructure and limited human capacities in
   the affected areas, these underground water resources cannot be
   exploited adequately. Against this, background innovative and adapted
   technologies are required to utilize hard-to-access water resources in a
   sustainable way. In this context, the German-Indonesian joint R\&D
   project ``Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Indonesia'' dealt
   with the development of highly adaptable water technologies and
   management strategies. Under the aegis of the Karlsruhe Institute of
   Technology (KIT) and funded by the German Ministry of Education and
   Research (BMBF), these innovative technical concepts were exemplarily
   implemented to remedy this deficiency in the model region Gunung Sewu, a
   karst area situated on the southern coast of Java Island, Indonesia. The
   experiences gained through the interdisciplinary joint R\&D activities
   clearly showed that even in the case of availability of appropriate
   technologies, a comprising transfer of knowhow and the buildup of
   capabilities (Capacity Development) is inevitable to sustainably
   implement and disseminate new methods. In this context, an adapted water
   supply facility was developed by KIT which hereafter shall serve for
   demonstration, teaching, and research purposes. The plant's
   functionality, its teaching and research concept, as well as the design
   process, which was accomplished in collaboration with the University
   Gadjah Mada (UGM), Yogyakarta, Indonesia, is the content of this present
   paper.},

Title = {Adaptive management assists reintroduction as higher tides threaten an

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In theory, extirpated plant species can be reintroduced and managed to
   restore sustainable populations. However, few reintroduced plants are
   known to persist for more than a few years. Our adaptive-management case
   study illustrates how we restored the endangered hemiparasitic annual
   plant, Chloropyron maritimum subsp. maritimum (salt marsh bird's beak),
   to Sweetwater Marsh, San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge, California,
   United States, and used monitoring and experimentation to identify the
   factors limiting the reintroduced population. After extirpation in 1988,
   reintroduction starting that year led to a resilient, genetically
   diverse population in 2016 (a ``boom{''} of approximately 14,000) that
   rebounded from a ``bust{''} (62 in 2014). Multiple regressions
   attributed 82\% of the variation in population counts to tidal
   amplitude, rainfall, and temperature. Populations of salt marsh bird's
   beak crashed when the diurnal tide range peaked during the 18.6-year
   lunar nodal cycle (a rarely considered factor that periodically added
   approximately 12 cm to tidal ranges). We explain booms as follows:
   During smaller tidal amplitudes, above-average rainfall could desalinize
   upper intertidal soils and stimulate salt marsh bird's beak germination.
   Then, moderate temperature in May favors growth to reproduction in June.
   In addition, salt marsh bird's beak needs a short and open canopy of
   native perennial plants, with roots to parasitize (not non-native annual
   grass pseudohosts) and nearby upland soil for a preferred pollinator,
   ground-burrowing bees. Although our reintroduced salt marsh bird's beak
   population is an exceptional case of persistence, this rare
   species-specific environmental and biological requirement makes it
   vulnerable to rising sea levels and global warming.},

Title = {Accounting for health in climate change policies: a case study of Fiji},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Background: Climate change is expected to affect the health of most
   populations in the coming decades, having the greatest impact on the
   poorest and most disadvantaged people in the world. The Pacific islands,
   including Fiji, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate
   change.
   Objective: The three major health impacts of climate change in Fiji
   explored in this study were dengue fever, diarrhoeal disease, and
   malnutrition, as they each pose a significant threat to human health.
   The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent the Fiji
   National Climate Change Policy, and a selection of relevant sectoral
   policies, account for these human health effects of climate change.
   Design: The study employed a three-pronged policy analysis to evaluate:
   1) the content of the Fijian National Climate Change Policy and to what
   extent health was incorporated within this; 2) the context within which
   the policy was developed; 3) the relevant processes; and 4) the actors
   involved. A selection of relevant sectoral policies were also analysed
   to assess the extent to which these included climate change and health
   considerations.
   Results: The policy analysis showed that these three health impacts of
   climate change were only considered to a minor extent, and often
   indirectly, in both the Fiji National Climate Change Policy and the
   corresponding National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, as well as
   the Public Health Act. Furthermore, supporting documents in relevant
   sectors including water and agriculture made no mention of climate
   change and health impacts.
   Conclusions: The projected health impacts of climate change should be
   considered as part of reviewing the Fiji National Climate Change Policy
   and National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and the Public Health
   Act. In the interest of public health, this should include strategies
   for combating dengue fever, malnutrition, and water-borne disease.
   Related sectoral policies in water and agriculture should also be
   revised to consider climate change and its impact on human health.
   Approaches to include health aspects of climate change within sectoral
   and climate change specific policies should be encouraged, via a number
   of mechanisms, such as the Health in All Policies approach. Future
   research could support the Fiji health sector in developing climate
   change and health programmes.},

Title = {Scattered accumulation hotspots of macro-litter on the seafloor:
   Insights for mitigation actions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {292},
Number = {A},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Marine litter is an ever-increasing problem that demands immediate
   reduction plans and mitigation actions that should act synergically to
   efficiently meet ambitious goals. Since the seafloor has been recognized
   as the major sink for marine debris, the study of litter accumulation
   dynamics represent a fundamental tool to evaluate possible removal
   actions. We analysed a 7 years (2013-2019) standardized data series
   collected along Sardinian fishing grounds through MEDiterranean
   International Trawl Survey, for which estimates of density and weight of
   seafloor macro-litter were calculated for over 707 hauls. Results show
   the absence of any temporal trend in seafloor macro-litter density and
   weight, but rather indicate a spatial and bathymetric segregation of
   different litter categories. Our data showed how different sources and
   physical features of macro-litter items (i.e., plastic and fishing gear,
   rubber, glass, metals, and cloth) led to spatially segregated
   accumulation hotspots. We also point out here how the identification of
   seafloor macro-litter hotspots using aggregated data that include
   plastic items could obscure the identification of other segregated but
   yet relevant hotspots of other macro-litter categories accumulated in
   the marine environment. These hotspots often occurred at shallower
   depths and closer to coastlines, thus representing potential spots where
   eventual future litter removal action could be prioritized.},

Abstract = {Identification of spatial gradient in the vulnerability of white leg
   shrimp production to climate change is imperative in the formulation and
   implementation of suitable adaptive measures. A composite vulnerability
   index was computed by employing 36 variables pertaining to exposure
   (11), sensitivity (11) and adaptive capacity (14) dimensions to map the
   extent of vulnerability in white leg shrimp production across Indian
   states. Based on its magnitude, the vulnerability index was categorized
   into three groups, namely low, moderate and high. Results showed that
   the mean composite vulnerability index was 0.65 and ranged from 0.34 to
   0.99 indicating that there was a strong spatial pattern. Among the nine
   states, Goa (0.99), Kerala (0.84) and Odisha (0.77) were highly
   vulnerable; Gujarat (0.75), Karnataka (0.57) and West Bengal (0.56) were
   moderately vulnerable; and Tamil Nadu (0.54), Andhra Pradesh (0.46) and
   Maharashtra (0.34) were less vulnerable to shrimp production. About
   one-fourth of the production and culture area of white leg shrimp were
   in moderate and highly vulnerable regions. The impact of climate change
   on shrimp production is diverse but can be reduced by implementing
   adaptive measures-suitable policies and investment plans-which should be
   region-specific.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Scientists have recorded the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
   small-scale fishers (SSFs), such as stagnating market demands and
   reduction in market price and income. Even though scientific evidence
   has heeded to these impacts, there is limited evidence regarding the
   long-term impacts and coping mechanisms of SSFs over longer periods. In
   addition, few studies have analysed these impacts and strategies from
   multiple perspectives. Our study aims to describe the perceived impacts
   of the COVID-19 outbreak on the communities of SSFs and the strategies
   adopted by them since the beginning of the outbreak in Trang Province,
   Thailand. Both qualitative and quantitative data obtained through
   semi-structured interviews indicated that, in the early stage of the
   outbreak, the SSFs used their natural, financial, and social capitals
   wisely; notably, human capitals were essential for the recovery in the
   later stages. Our findings suggested that an adaptive capacity to
   flexibly change livelihoods played an important role for the SSFs to
   cope with the outbreak; most importantly, our study indicated that, in a
   stagnating global economy, alternative income sources may not
   necessarily help SSFs.},

Title = {Restoring for the climate: a review of coastal wetland restoration
   research in the last 30 years},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wetlands provide significant ecosystem services yet are ranked among
   some of the most imperiled habitats. To maximize prioritization of these
   habitats a better understanding of the full range of ecosystem functions
   is needed, starting with an examination of how coastal wetlands have
   been portrayed in restoration literature to date. This study consists of
   a literature review and the use of automated topic analyses aimed at (1)
   summarizing the current research related to coastal wetland restoration,
   (2) identifying the key fields of research, and (3) identifying research
   efforts connecting restoration and climate adaptation strategies (e.g.
   blue carbon). Of the 702 papers sourced for this analysis, most studies
   were conducted in North America and Europe. An increase in articles
   considering wetland restoration was found from 1985 to October 2020,
   with 40\% of the research published just in the last triennia
   (2018-2020). Topic division highlights the emergence of studies related
   to management under climate change (e.g. sea level rise, adaptive
   management) and to carbon sequestration as separate fields of research
   from classical ecological studies. This reveals the need to ensure that
   classical ecological research is not neglected by work relating to
   climate strategies, which depend upon an accurate understanding of
   ecological processes.},

Abstract = {Recent and historic high-impact events have demonstrated the flood risks
   faced by exposed coastal areas. These risks will increase due to climate
   change and economic development. This requires a re-evaluation of
   coastal disaster risk reduction DRR strategies and prevention,
   mitigation and preparedness PMP measures. To this end, the UN Office for
   Disaster Risk Reduction formulated the Hyogo Framework for Action, and
   the EU has issued the Floods Directive. By their nature, neither is
   specific about the methods to be used to assess coastal risks,
   particularly those risks resulting from dune and structure overtopping,
   the non-stationarity of surge and flash flood events, and coastal
   morphodynamic response. This paper describes a set of open-source and
   open-access methods, tools and management approaches to fill this gap. A
   Coastal Risk Assessment Framework will assess coastal risk at a regional
   scale. Thus critical hotspots can be identified for which an
   impact-oriented Early Warning System/Decision Support System is
   developed. This can be applied in dual mode: as a forecast and warning
   system and as an ex-ante planning tool to evaluate the vulnerability.
   The tools are demonstrated on case study sites on a range of EU coasts
   with diverse geomorphic settings, land use, forcing, hazard types and
   socio-economic, cultural and environmental characteristics. Specific DRR
   plans will be developed for all sites. A management guide of PMP
   measures and management approaches is to be developed. The toolkit will
   benefit forecasting and civil protection agencies, coastal managers,
   local government, community members, NGOs, the general public and
   scientists.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {71},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {England and Wales has a long history of recognising coastal change,
   where coastal morphology adjusts in response to changing patterns of
   erosion and accretion, especially in the vicinity of ports and
   reclamations in estuaries. The long history of responses to coastal
   change can be linked to the history of coastal engineering, the wider
   development of coastal management; and most recently shoreline
   management, as a policy framework for managing flood and erosion risks
   on changing coasts. Coastal change is ongoing and long-term so that
   management is necessarily a process and effective delivery requires an
   adequate monitoring programme to inform management decisions. Monitoring
   also enables adaptive and flexible solutions to be implemented that take
   account of the inherent uncertainties such as future climate, promoting
   well adapted rather than mal-adapted outcomes. Given the current
   concerns about accelerated rates of sea-level rise and climate change
   this paper considers the development of both shoreline management and
   the supporting national monitoring programme in England to assess
   whether the SMP process remains useful in these circumstances. The
   lessons and experience are widely transferable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {New Zealand kiwifruit growers' vulnerability to climate and other
   stressors},

Abstract = {Commercial cultivation of kiwifruit in New Zealand is concentrated in a
   relatively small area of the North Island. Cultivation is economically
   significant and growing quickly. However, current understanding of
   vulnerability for this, and other primary sector activities in New
   Zealand, makes almost exclusive use of linear outcome-oriented
   frameworks. Drawing on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with
   kiwifruit growers and orchard managers, workshops and analysis of
   secondary data, a ``bottom-up{''} contextual assessment of vulnerability
   was developed and empirically applied. The findings suggest that climate
   and markets are the main sources of exposure for growers, with
   sensitivity moderated by location. Growers employ mostly short-term,
   reactive adaptive strategies to manage climate exposure and sensitivity,
   but have less capacity to respond to market-related stressors. Warmer
   and drier conditions are likely to have adverse effects for kiwifruit
   production and compound existing vulnerabilities. An ageing population
   and other processes of rural change may also constrain future
   adaptation. In order to realise opportunities and minimise losses,
   longer-term strategic responses are required. The paper demonstrates the
   need to move beyond outcome-oriented and model-based vulnerability
   assessments in New Zealand, to consider the broad range of the factors
   that contribute to vulnerability in the nation's agricultural sectors.
   It provides a basis for further consideration of multiple exogenous
   impacts in the industry and confirms the critical importance of
   qualitatively vulnerability assessments to determine spatially specific
   outcomes.},

   Anticipating change, when and how to change pathway},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {100-107},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise challenges public policy-making because existing planning
   frameworks and methods are designed to promote certainty using static
   and time-bound planning and legal instruments. Sea-level rise is a
   dynamic and uncertain process, which is deeply uncertain towards the
   latter part of this century and beyond. Communities require decision
   making approaches that can enable adjustments to policies ahead of
   damage, without entrenching current exposure to hazards or incurring
   larger than necessary adjustment costs in the future. We first discuss
   the nature of the sea-level problem, the policy context that creates
   decision-making challenges and how they have been typically addressed
   through policy and practice. Secondly, we show how an assessment and
   planning approach, designed to address uncertainty and change (the
   Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) planning approach), has been
   integrated into national guidance for coastal hazard and climate change
   decision making in New Zealand. The Guidance integrates hazard and
   sea-level rise assessments with uncertainty type and with the scale and
   scope of activity. It is underpinned with values-based community
   engagement, and uses signals and decision triggers for monitoring and
   adjusting pathways to meet objectives over time. The applicability of
   the approach in the Guidance for other policy problems involving
   uncertainty, is also discussed.},

   Stakeholder Participation Process and Policy Implications for Transport,

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change is a critical sustainability challenge for islands and
   their main economic sectors. Rising sea levels, extreme temperatures,
   and drier conditions are the impacts with the most significant potential
   to amplify the economic damage on islands. However, their isolation and
   natural conditions bring about some leeway to respond to climate impacts
   on their terms. This paper aims to provide a local-level analysis and
   ranking of alternative adaptation pathways in an island context through
   the stakeholders' lens. This study reviews the latest advancements in
   adaptation science and proposes a catalogue of adaptation and risk
   management options that feed a participatory assessment and ranking by
   local stakeholders. The research was conducted on the island of Sicily
   (Italy) and saw the participation of high-level experts and tourism,
   energy, and maritime transport representatives. It employs a sequential
   process of four ordered steps oriented towards adaptation planning and
   stakeholders' engagement. The process reveals breaches between what
   stakeholders' would prioritise when designing policy pathways and their
   opinion about the most beneficial and balanced adaptation programmes
   across the sustainability criteria. Results indicate that, according to
   stakeholders, the priorities are to prepare the energy, tourism, and
   maritime transport sectors to confront future climate-related events
   more efficiently. Other transformational actions to ensure long-term
   social-ecological resilience, which requires significant structural
   changes and substantial investments, are not at the core of the public
   needs.},

Title = {Coastal erosion risk assessment in the dynamic estuary: The Meghna
   estuary case of Bangladesh coast},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Erosion is one of the predominant hazards in coastal Bangladesh. For
   implementing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, assessment
   of risk to coastal erosion is crucial. This study aimed to assess the
   levels of risk to coastal erosion in the Meghna estuary, a major
   erosion-prone area in the coastal region of the country impacted by
   abrupt changes in hydrological and geomorphological conditions. Using
   physical, environmental, and socio-economic geospatial data, this is the
   first attempt in assessing erosion risk and characterizing three main
   risk components: hazard, vulnerability, and exposure at a regional
   extent in the estuary. A total of 19 indicators were considered, and
   statistical methods assisted with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
   were used for the construction of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure
   indices, which were then integrated to calculate erosion risk
   comprehensively at the lowermost administrative unit (union) level
   throughout the study area. The results of hazard and vulnerability
   analyses depicted 35.72\% and 46.69\% areas as highly hazard-prone and
   highly vulnerable to erosion, respectively. Assessment of the exposure
   index exhibited 42.25\% area as highly exposed to coastal erosion in the
   estuary. Finally, the results quantified different levels of risk as
   very high (14.91\%), high (19.36\%), moderate (23.40\%), low (23.91\%),
   and very low (18.41\%). Among 161 coastal unions, 45 unions were
   identified as high to very high erosion risk-prone areas, located in the
   coasts of Bhola, Noakhali, and Barishal districts including their major
   islands. The validation result confirmed a reasonable level of
   acceptance of the calculated risk map, despite several data limitations.
   The geospatial distribution of different risk categories presented in
   this paper can assist relevant authorities with reliable spatial
   information in formulating improved erosion risk mitigation policies in
   the most dynamic estuary of the country.},

Title = {Resilience of coastal agricultural systems in Bangladesh: Assessment for
   agroecosystem stewardship strategies},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {106},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Assessments of ``resilience{''} are becoming a priority across multiple
   sectors. Specifically, the coastal agricultural system in Bangladesh
   faces a multitude of problems such as sea level rise. Building
   resilience for this system is thus important in accelerating the
   country's socio-economic development. Therefore, the objectives of this
   study are (a) to assess resilience of coastal agricultural systems and
   (b) to develop coastal agroecosystem stewardship strategies in
   Bangladesh. Resilience was assessed quantitatively, based on an
   established framework that includes three capacities (i.e., absorptive,
   adaptive and transformative) and five dimensions, namely, social,
   economic, ecological, physical and institutional. Fifteen indicators
   were developed by applying an assemblage of top-down and bottom-up
   approaches. A structured questionnaire was used to survey 330 households
   from 15 villages in five coastal sub-districts. The percentile value of
   composite resilience indices revealed that one-fifths of the coastal
   farmers (or households) had a mixed ability (e.g., fish farming skills)
   and capacity (e.g., better decision-making) to recover, reorganise and
   evolve following shocks (e.g., flash flood) and stresses (e.g., water
   logging). Following resilience assessment, five coastal agroecosystem
   stewardship strategies (facilitating adaptive agricultural governance;
   promoting economic and ecological diversity; fostering social learning;
   investing in coastal infrastructure; and increasing agricultural
   productivity) are developed based on principal component analysis. The
   methods of objectively developing stewardship strategies can be
   replicable to other coastal areas. The findings of this study are
   intended to be used for contributing to coastal adaptation planning in
   Bangladesh, especially for the Delta Plan 2100.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are exerting increasingly more pressure on coral
   reef ecosystem services in the Anthropocene. Balancing trade-offs
   between local economic demands, preservation of traditional values, and
   maintenance of both biodiversity and ecosystem resilience is a challenge
   for reef managers and resource users. Consistently, growing reef tourism
   sectors offer more lucrative livelihoods than subsistence and artisanal
   fisheries at the cost of traditional heritage loss and ecological
   damage. Using a systematic review of coral reef fishery reconstructions
   since the 1940s, we show that declining trends in fisheries catch and
   fish stocks dominate coral reef fisheries globally, due in part to
   overfishing of schooling and spawning-aggregating fish stocks vulnerable
   to exploitation. Using a separate systematic review of coral reef
   tourism studies since 2013, we identify socio-ecological impacts and
   economic opportunities associated to the industry. Fisheries and tourism
   have the potential to threaten the ecological stability of coral reefs,
   resulting in phase shifts toward less productive coral-depleted
   ecosystem states. We consider whether four common management strategies
   (unmanaged commons, ecosystem-based management, co-management, and
   adaptive co-management) fulfil ecological conservation and socioeconomic
   goals, such as living wage, job security, and maintenance of cultural
   traditions. Strategies to enforce resource exclusion and withhold
   traditional resource rights risk social unrest; thus, the coexistence of
   fisheries and tourism industries is essential. The purpose of this
   chapter is to assist managers and scientists in their responsibility to
   devise implementable strategies that protect local community livelihoods
   and the coral reefs on which they rely.},

   Senegalese Fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE RESOURCE ECONOMICS},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {267-282},
Abstract = {In most coastal countries the fisheries sector satisfies multiple
   socioeconomic needs. This is especially the case in many coastal
   developing countries where fisheries represent a substantial source of
   food, jobs, and income. However, fisheries exert strong pressures on
   marine resources with threats to their sustainability. The context of
   overexploitation of marine resources is combined with a great diversity
   of stakeholders intervening in the governance of the fisheries. Thus, a
   better understanding of the challenges fisheries face is essential to
   enact management policies to ensure sustainability Through a case study
   of the Senegalese fisheries, this article develops quantitative
   indicators of social, economic, and ecological states of the fisheries.
   Standardized principal components analysis combined with the
   Hodrick-Prescott filter is used to assess trendy in the indicators.
   These indicators can contribute to an adaptive management framework in a
   context of multiple management objectives with diverse stakeholders and
   uncertainty.},

Title = {Architectural design concept and guidelines for floating structures for

Abstract = {Previous studies indicate that floating structures developed through the
   last decades concluding that it's the most sustainable solution against
   sea level rise (SLR), preferring it to land reclamation approaches
   regarding sustainability, lifespan, and cost-effectiveness, that
   Egyptian researches seem to disregard. This paper guides architects and
   urban planners when designing floating structures by introducing new
   approach of floating community model and architectural design guidelines
   for floating structures for tackling SLR impacts on Abu-Qir. To
   illustrate such approach, this paper initially conducts analysis on
   Abu-Qir and coastal management solutions practiced as their properties
   provide the required knowledge for selecting the best mitigation
   solution for such area. Second, it conducts exploratory analysis to
   investigate floating structures as a more sustainable and long-term
   solution. Third, applying conclusions from previous sections of site
   analysis, mitigation solutions, and floating structures to define a
   floating community concept model for Abu-Qir. Findings support key
   arguments that traditional mitigation methods aren't sustainable or
   long-term solutions. Analysis demonstrate Abu-Qir Bay as the most
   vulnerable area to SLR. Although floating structures have demonstrated
   not to be the optimum solution in every case regarding
   cost-effectiveness and/or site suitability, however upon site analysis,
   it presents itself as the ideal solution for Abu-Qir bay. (C) 2019 The

Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {309-318},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We present case studies supporting management of two rare plant species
   in tidal wetlands of the San Francisco Estuary. We used empirical
   demographic analyses to identify factors to enhance population
   establishment and survival of Chloropyron molle subsp. molle
   (Orobancaceae), an annual hemiparasite, and to compare reintroduced with
   natural populations. Twelve years after outplanting, the reintroduced
   population persists but is in decline; impediments to success include
   the lack of adaptive management response to weed invasions and muted
   variance in hydrology. Transplantation of Lilaeopsis masonii (Apiaceae),
   a rhizomatous perennial herb, failed to meet success criteria for
   mitigation at local project scale, but dispersal and establishment of
   metapopulation patches indicated persistence at the landscape scale.
   This species has been found to be genetically indistinct from a
   widespread congener, and has few threats to persistence so long as
   suitable habitat is present. These two examples demonstrate the need for
   integrated conservation management strategies that prioritize habitat
   connectivity and maintain physical processes to support dispersal in
   response to sea level rise. For the hemiparasite, assisted colonization
   may sustain populations threatened by sea level rise, but only if a
   strong commitment to effective stewardship is realized.},

Volume = {38},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Vulnerability of small-scale fishers in the north coast of Parana State,
   Southern Brazil, has been increasing due to a decline in catches and
   general problems of access to and management of natural resources,
   associated with biodiversity conservation policies. The predicted
   effects of climate change will represent an additional source of
   disturbance on local livelihoods. This study aimed to describe
   vulnerability of fishers and their adaptation strategies to ongoing
   reductions in catches, considered an analogue of possible responses to
   expected effects of climate change, and to evaluate the influence of
   no-take protected areas on them. Interviews were applied to 213
   households, in 9 villages from Guaraquecaba, in the Paranagua Estuarine
   Complex. Results show that vulnerability varies in different spatial
   levels, mainly due to differences in the reliance on fisheries as a
   source of income, and in distribution of physical and social capital.
   Protected areas, if not adequately managed, can have a double negative
   effect on more vulnerable households, by restricting their access to
   mangrove resources in the present, and by limiting the viability of
   their favoured adaptation strategy for the future. These results are
   potentially useful for the development of biodiversity conservation and
   fisheries management actions adequate to the local level, and that
   contribute to reduce inequality and build resilience of fishers and the
   coastal ecosystems they rely on, in a scenario of declining fisheries
   and climate change.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {National parks often serve as a cornerstone for a country's species and
   ecosystem conservation efforts. However, despite the protection these
   sites afford, climate change is expected to drive a substantial change
   in their bird assemblages. We used species distribution models to
   predict the change in environmental suitability (i.e., how well
   environmental conditions explain the presence of a species) of 49
   Canadian national parks during summer and winter for 434 bird species
   under a 2 degrees C warming scenario, anticipated to occur in Canada
   around the mid-21st century. We compared these to existing species
   distributions in the 2010s, and classified suitability projections for
   each species at each park as potential extirpation, worsening, stable,
   improving, or potential colonisation. Across all parks, and both
   seasons, 70\% of the projections indicate change, including a 25\%
   turnover in summer assemblages and 30\% turnover in winter assemblages.
   The majority of parks are projected to have increases in species
   richness and functional traits in winter, compared to a mix of increases
   and decreases in both in summer. However, some changes are expected to
   vary by region, such as Arctic region parks being likely to experience
   the most potential colonisation, while some of the Mixedwood Plains and
   Atlantic Maritime region parks may experience the greatest turnover and
   potential extirpation in summer if management actions are not taken to
   mitigate some of these losses. Although uncertainty exists around the
   precise rate and impacts of climate change, our results indicate that
   conservation practices that assume stationarity of environmental
   conditions will become untenable. We propose general guidance to help
   managers adapt their conservation actions to consider the potentially
   substantive changes in bird assemblages that are projected, including
   managing for persistence and change.},

Abstract = {Uncertainty surrounding climate change has encouraged policy makers to
   engage in flexible and exploratory policies and forms of policy making.
   The article examines the potential of experimentation in devising
   coastal adaptation policies, taking into account its political
   dimensions. We analysed a multi-level experiment, funded by the French
   Ministry for the Environment from 2012 to 2015, where coastal
   municipalities volunteered to simulate the implementation of planned
   retreat as an adaptation strategy. Using insights from discursive
   institutionalism, we tracked developments throughout the experiment
   period. We highlight a combined process of governance experiment,
   allowing social innovation at local and regional scales, and a more
   strategic tool for the state, governing and steering local coastal
   policy with new instruments. We shed light on a particular policy
   entrepreneur (a public organization dealing with coastal management)
   playing at the intersection of these two forms, and in the interplay of
   policy scales. Although the experiment contributed to the innovation of
   legal and economic instruments and produced policy feedbacks in local
   planning and governance, learning capacities of the multi-scale
   architecture are still moderate to make planned retreat a reality in the
   near future. The conclusion considers performative and interpretive
   effects of policy experiments as further research questions to explore.},

Title = {Adapting or maladapting: Building resilience to climate-related
   disasters in coastal cities},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Number = {B},
Pages = {295-309},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Despite the increasing risks associated with climate-related hazards,
   urban development in many coastal cities continues to take place on
   low-lying, high-risk land. Resilience is a key concept in adaptation,
   however, in the context of cities it is a complex phenomenon influenced
   by a diverse range of factors. This paper explores how the key elements
   of urban resilience (agents, institutions, and systems) interact to
   determine the types of approaches cities take to build resilience in two
   Australian cities. It uses case study data including semi-structured
   interviews with a diverse group of stakeholders ranging from local and
   state government authorities, non government organisations, consulting
   firms, and researchers to the insurance industry. Findings indicate that
   the attitude of agents shapes the institutions and systems thus
   determining types of adaptation strategies in response to climate
   change. When the community's desire to live close to water couples with
   a lack of understanding or underestimation of the impacts, adaptation
   efforts are undermined. These findings call for a focus on the key role
   of agents for a transformational approach to building resilience that is
   based on shared learning.},

Title = {Adaptation to climate change for food security in the lower Mekong Basin},
Journal = {FOOD SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-450},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Variability in water cycles driven by climate change is considered
   likely to impact rice production in the near future. Rice is the main
   staple food for the population in the lower Mekong Basin and the demand
   for food is expected to grow due to increase in population. This paper
   examines the impact of climate change on rice production in the lower
   Mekong Basin, evaluates some widely used adaptation options, and
   analyses their implications for overall food security by 2050. Climate
   change data used in the study are the future climate projection for two
   IPCC SRES scenarios, A2 and B2, based on ECHAM4 General Circulation
   Model downscaled to the Mekong region using the PRECIS (Providing
   Regional Climates for Impact Studies) system. In general, the results
   suggest that yield of rainfed rice may increase significantly in the
   upper part of the basin in Laos and Thailand and may decrease in the
   lower part of the basin in Cambodia and Vietnam. Irrigated rice may not
   be affected by climate change if increased irrigation requirements are
   met. Negative impact on the yield of rainfed rice can be offset and net
   increase in yield can be achieved by applying widely used adaptation
   options such as changing planting date, supplementary irrigation and
   increased fertilizer input. Analysis of the projected production,
   considering population growth by 2050, suggests that food security of
   the basin is unlikely to be threatened by the increased population and
   climate change, excluding extreme events such as sea level rise and
   cyclones.},

Title = {Addressing Long-Term Operational Risk Management in Port Docks under
   Climate Change Scenarios-A Spanish Case Study},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ports are strategic hubs of the logistic chain and are likely to be
   exposed to natural hazard events. Variation of metocean agents derived
   from climate change, such as sea level rise or changes in the magnitude,
   frequency, duration, and direction of storms, can modify the
   infrastructural and operational vulnerability of port areas and
   activities, demanding the development of adaptation or mitigation
   strategies. In this context, the present paper is aimed to propose a
   downscaling methodology for addressing local effects at port scale. In
   addition, based on previously identifying and defining the Areas of
   Operational Interest (AOIs) inside ports, an approach towards the
   evaluation of operational vulnerability is offered. The whole process is
   applied, as a practical case, to the Port of Gijon (Spain) for different
   General Circulation Models (GCMs), concentration scenarios, and time
   horizons. The results highlight, in line with other publications, that
   inter-model differences are, so far, more significant than intra-model
   differences from dissimilar time horizons or concentration scenarios.},

Abstract = {The depletion of groundwater resources can seriously hinder the
   availability of irrigation water in India and can thus adversely affect
   agricultural productivity, jeopardizing the food security efforts. To
   meet the future demand for food production India must circumspectly
   manage its water resources and try saving and conserving water,
   particularly for irrigated agriculture; enhancing use-efficiency of
   surface and ground water; improving groundwater recharge; and using
   waste waters with safety. This paper discusses issues related to
   irrigation water management and focuses on innovative practices,
   strategies and approaches. The technological advances in the area of
   super absorbent polymer hydrogel, lining of canals and field channels;
   breeding short duration and drought tolerant aerobic rice varieties;
   strategies for using wastewater, use of remote sensing technologies are
   highlighted. The issues like crop diversification, mitigation and
   adaptation strategies dealing with climate change and the relevance of
   virtual water trading are discussed in an Indian perspective. The
   governmental policy decisions to arrest the trends of rapidly falling
   groundwater along with their impact are also discussed.},

Title = {Living shorelines achieve functional equivalence to natural fringe
   marshes across multiple ecological metrics},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Nature-based shoreline protection provides a welcome class of
   adaptations to promote ecological resilience in the face of climate
   change. Along coastlines, living shorelines are among the preferred
   adaptation strategies to both reduce erosion and provide ecological
   functions. As an alternative to shoreline armoring, living shorelines
   are viewed favorably among coastal managers and some private property
   owners, but they have yet to undergo a thorough examination of how their
   levels of ecosystem functions compare to their closest natural
   counterpart: fringing marshes. Here, we provide a synthesis of results
   from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared
   numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish,
   invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon
   storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living
   shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia,
   USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading,
   placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S.
   alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward
   and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found
   that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes
   in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due
   to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic
   sands. These data support the prioritization of living shorelines as a
   coastal adaptation strategy.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on urban planning strategies to adapt cities to the
   increasing rising of temperatures during summer heat waves. The main
   target is to investigate which configuration and distribution pattern of
   green spaces could effectively improve natural cooling of urban
   environments. Although the benefit that green areas give to natural
   cooling is well known, this kind of studies has hardly been carried out,
   especially at an urban scale where it is crucial to define quantities
   and density of green areas to address open spaces design. To reach this
   goal, a methodology based on the interpretation of the statistical
   correlation among temperature, urban parameters and green areas
   configurational indicators was implemented and applied to the case study
   of the Municipality of Naples, performing all the analysis in a GIS.
   Results provide guidelines to improve natural cooling in urban areas
   adopting the most effective configuration and distribution of green
   areas within a densely-built context.},

Title = {Urban CO2 mitigation strategies under the Covenant of Mayors: An
   assessment of 124 European cities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {161-177},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {In 2008, the European Commission (EC) launched the Covenant of Mayors
   (CoM), a voluntary agreement under which local governments commit to
   reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20\% within 2020, in order to reinforce
   local authorities in designing strategies to mitigate climate change in
   coherence with the European Union's climate policy. The CoM may be
   defined as a coordinated collection of experiments based on common rules
   established by the EC. Cities signing the CoM commit to follow
   guidelines and standardized methodologies in setting CO2 emission
   reduction targets and in designing and implementing policies and
   measures to reach them, through the definition of key tools such as the
   Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) and the Sustainable Energy Action Plan
   (SEAP). The present study analyses the emission reduction strategies of
   a sample of 124 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, signatories
   of the CoM, which delivered a SEAP by February 2014. More than 5500
   actions planned by the sample cities were analysed and categorized. The
   most relevant actions in terms of recurrence and mitigation impact were
   assessed. Finally a set of variables was tested through a regression so
   as to determine their influence on emission reductions strategies.
   The main results of this study show that the sample cities accounted for
   a total of 370 million tons of CO2 emissions in selected baseline years
   and 94 million tons of intended emission reductions per year. The total
   emission reductions planned by cities reached 25\% of the baseline
   emissions. Buildings and Transport stood out as the sectors where cities
   intend to deliver the largest emission reductions. Furthermore the
   analysis showed that cities' administrations attribute higher potential
   to actions in subsectors under their direct control (municipal
   buildings, public transport, municipal fleet and public lighting)
   compared to actions in subsectors managed by private actors (households
   and firms). In the Building sector, the category of action delivering
   the highest share of CO2 emission reductions was represented by
   integrated actions, which combine several types of intervention so as to
   maximise the energy efficiency of buildings. In the transport sector, it
   was the modal shift, which implies a transition from private transport
   to public and cleaner transport modes. In both the Building and
   Transport sectors, cities plan to reduce the major amount of CO2
   emissions through the implementation of management and organization,
   infrastructure construction and awareness-raising policy levers.
   Our results may be useful to urban policy makers to shape their
   mitigation strategies in coherence with cities' commitments and plans
   and to replicate policies and actions on the basis of CoM signatories'
   experiences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the recent years, microgrids have become increasingly popular among
   the consumers due to its energy efficient mechanism, network benefits
   and improved energy reliability. However, when they are operated as
   autonomous systems, several technical problems related with its
   operations and control has emerged as a challenge. To overcome this
   impending issue, this paper proposes an optimized approach by
   implementing adaptive solar PV generators with MPPT control (maximum
   power point tracking) to support an islanded microgrid in a low voltage
   network. Due to improper control and high maintenance, the PV generator
   provides very low efficiency during conversion. Therefore, the proposed
   strategy offers an effective coordination between inverter V-f control
   (voltage and frequency) and P-Q control, MPPT control and energy storage
   control of the islanded microgrids to remove device fluctuations and
   deviations. Also, the control strategy employed take care of State of
   Charge (SOC) stabilization of battery unit. The simulation of the
   proposed model is carried out in Matlab/Simulink. The results clearly
   confirm the potency of suggested controlling and adaptive strategy.},

Abstract = {Climatic projections are essential to frame resilient strategies towards
   futuristic impacts of climate changes on fish species and habitat. The
   present study projects the variations of climatic variables such as Sea
   Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), Sea Level Rise
   (SLR), Precipitation (Pr), and pH along the Indian Ocean. Climate
   projections for 2030, 2050 and 2080 were obtained as MIROC-ESM-CHEM,
   CMIP5 model output for each Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)
   scenarios. Each climatic variable was assessed for any change against
   the reference year of 2015. The RCP scenarios showed an increasing trend
   for SLR and SST while a decreasing trend for SSS and pH. The study
   focuses on assessing the impacts of projected variations on marine and
   aquaculture system. The climate model projections show that the SST
   during 2080 is likely to rise by 0.69 degrees C for the lowest emissions
   scenario and 2.6 degrees C for the highest emissions scenario. Elevated
   temperature disturbs the homeostasis of fish and subjects to
   physiological stress in the habitat resulting in mortality. These
   thermal limits can predict distributional changes of marine species in
   response to climate change. Projections showed no significant changes in
   the pattern of precipitation. Changes in sea level rise and sea surface
   salinity reduce water quality, spawning and seed availability, increased
   disease incidence and damage to freshwater aquaculture system by
   salinization of groundwater. The results show that variation in SST and
   pH have a potential impact on marine fisheries while SSS, SLR,
   Precipitation affects the aquaculture systems. The synergic effects of
   climatic variations are found to have negative implications on capture
   fisheries as well as aquaculture system and are elucidated through this
   work.},

Title = {Application of decision theory to conservation management: recovery of
   Hector's dolphin},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-102},
Abstract = {Decision theory provides an organised approach to decision making in
   natural resource conservation. The theory requires clearly stated
   objectives, decision alternatives and decision-outcome utilities, and
   thus allows for the separation of values (conservation and other
   societal objectives) from beliefs. Models express belief in the likely
   response of the system to conservation actions, and can range from
   simple, graphical representations to complex computer models. Models can
   be used to make predictions about likely decision-outcomes, and hence
   guide decision making. Decision making must account for uncertainty,
   which can be reduced but never eliminated. Uncertainty can be described
   via probabilities, which in turn can be used to compute the expected
   value of alternative decisions, averaging over all relevant sources of
   uncertainty. Reduction of uncertainty, where possible, improves decision
   making. Adaptive management involves the reduction of uncertainty via
   prediction under two or more alternative, structural models, comparison
   of model predictions to monitoring, and feedback via Bayes' Theorem into
   revising model weights, which in turn influences decision making. As
   part of a 3-day workshop on structured decision making (SDM) and
   adaptive resource management (ARM), we constructed a prototypical
   decision model for the recovery for Hector's dolphin (Cephalorynchus
   hectori), an endangered dolphin endemic to New Zealand coastal waters.
   Our model captures several steps in the process of building an SDM/ARM
   framework, and should be useful for managers wishing to apply these
   principles to dolphin conservation or other resources problems.},

Abstract = {The complex interactions between human activities and the environment at
   the interface of land and water is analyzed with a focus on the Somali
   Current (East Africa), and Indian Ocean Island States, subregions of the
   Global International Waters Assessment (GIWA). These 2 subregions
   contain some of the world's richest ecosystems, including the high
   biodiversity forests of Madagascar and the diverse coastal habitats of
   the eastern African coast. These ecosystems support local communities
   and national and regional economies. Current and future degradation of
   these systems, from water basins to continental shelves, affects the
   livelihoods and sustainability of the countries in the region, and
   long-term efforts to reduce poverty. The assessments determined that
   pollution and climate change are the primary environmental and social
   concerns in the Islands of the Indian Ocean, while freshwater shortage
   and unsustainable exploitation of fisheries and other living resources
   are the primary environmental and social concerns in East Africa. The
   GIWA approach, through assessing root causes of environmental concerns,
   enables the development of policy approaches for mitigating
   environmental degradation. This paper explores policy frameworks for
   mitigating the impacts, and reducing the drivers, of 3 environmental
   concerns-freshwater shortage; solid waste pollution; and climate
   change-addressing social and institutional causes and effects, and
   linking the subregions to broad international frameworks. The common
   theme in all 3 case studies is the need to develop integrated ecosystem
   and international waters policies, and mechanisms to manage conflicting
   interests and to limit threats to natural processes.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {166},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage is a key mitigation strategy proposed for
   keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees C. Offshore
   storage can provide up to 13\% of the global CO2 reduction required to
   achieve the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change goals. The public
   must be assured that potential leakages from storage reservoirs can be
   detected and that therefore the CO2 is safely contained. We conducted a
   controlled release of 675 kg CO2 within sediments at 120 m water depth,
   to simulate a leak and test novel detection, quantification and
   attribution approaches. We show that even at a very low release rate (6
   kg day(-1)), CO2 can be detected within sediments and in the water
   column. Alongside detection we show the fluxes of both dissolved and
   gaseous CO2 can be quantified. The CO2 source was verified using natural
   and added tracers. The experiment demonstrates that existing
   technologies and techniques can detect, attribute and quantify any
   escape of CO2 from sub-seabed reservoirs as required for public
   assurance, regulatory oversight and emissions trading schemes.},

Journal = {OCEAN DYNAMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Wind-generated ocean waves are key inputs for several studies and
   applications, both near the coast (coastal vulnerability assessment,
   coastal structures design, harbor operativity) and off-shore (a.o. oil
   and gas production, ship routes, and navigation safety). As such, the
   evaluation of trends in future wave climate is fundamental for the
   development of efficient policies in the framework of climate change
   adaptation and mitigation measures. This study focuses on the
   Mediterranean Sea, an area of primary interest, since it plays a crucial
   role in the worldwide maritime transport and it is highly populated
   along all its coasts. We perform an analysis of wave climate changes
   using an ensemble of 7 models under emission scenario RCP8.5, over the
   entire Mediterranean basin. Future projections of wave climate and their
   variability are analyzed taking into account annual statistics of wave
   parameters, such as significant wave height, mean period, and mean
   direction. The results show, on average, a decreasing trend of
   significant wave height and mean period, while the wave directions may
   be characterized by a slight eastward shift.},

Title = {Development and Application of a Method to Identify Salt Marsh
   Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise},
Journal = {ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {694-710},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Wetlands are commonly assessed for ecological condition and biological
   integrity using a three-tiered framework of landscape-scale assessment,
   rapid assessment protocols, and intensive biological and physiochemical
   measurements. However, increased inundation resulting from accelerated
   sea level rise (SLR) is negatively impacting tidal marsh ecosystem
   functions for US Northeast coastal wetlands, yet relative vulnerability
   to this stressor is not incorporated in condition assessments. This
   article assesses tools available to measure coastal wetland
   vulnerability to SLR, including measurements made as part of traditional
   rapid condition assessments (e.g., vegetation communities, soil
   strength), field and remote sensing-based measurements of elevation,
   VDatum, and Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) model outputs. A
   vulnerability metric that incorporates these tools was calibrated and
   validated using recent rates of marsh vegetation losses (1972-2011) as a
   surrogate for future vulnerability. The metric includes complementary
   measures of elevation capital, including the percentage of high vs. low
   marsh vegetation, Spartina alterniflora height, elevation measurements,
   and SLAMM outputs that collectively explained 62\% of the variability in
   recent rates of marsh vegetation loss. Stepwise regression revealed that
   all three elements (elevation, vegetation measures, and SLAMM outputs)
   explained significant and largely unique components of vulnerability to
   SLR, with the greatest level of overlap found between SLAMM outputs and
   elevation metrics. While soil strength varied predictably with habitat
   zone, it did not contribute significantly to the vulnerability metric.
   Despite the importance of determining wetland elevation above key tidal
   datums of mean sea level and mean high water, we caution that VDatum was
   found to perform poorly in back-barrier estuaries. This factor makes it
   difficult to compare elevation capital among marshes that differ in
   tidal range and poses accuracy problems for broad-scale modeling efforts
   that require accurate tidal datums. Given the pervasive pattern of
   coastal wetland drowning occurring in the Northeastern USA and
   elsewhere, we advocate that compilation of regional data on marsh
   habitats and vulnerability to SLR is crucial as it permits agencies to
   target adaptation to sites based on their vulnerability or mixture of
   habitats, it helps match sites to appropriate interventions, and it
   provides a broader regional context to site-specific management actions.
   Without such data, adaptation actions may be implemented where action is
   not necessary and to the disadvantage of vulnerable sites where
   opportunities for successful adaptation will be missed.},

Title = {How small communities respond to environmental change: patterns from
   tropical to polar ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Local communities throughout the world are experiencing extensive
   social, cultural, economic, environmental, and climatic changes. Rather
   than passively accepting the effects of such changes, many communities
   are responding in various ways to take advantage of opportunities and to
   minimize negative impacts. We review examples from 13 cases around the
   world to identify patterns in how communities have been able to respond
   to change. Communities are able to respond by making changes in the time
   and location of activities, by using different species, by developing or
   using new technologies, and by organizing themselves internally or in
   networks. The possible responses a community can make on its own
   constitute the autonomous response space. When communities work with
   others to respond, they are in the collaborative response space. These
   findings suggest that assessments concerning climate and other forms of
   change should include local responses as a foundation for policy
   recommendations, recognizing that both autonomous and collaborative
   responses can contribute to adaptation. Policies designed to achieve
   adaptation or sustainability should consider ways to expand the
   autonomous response space, thus freeing local initiative, while also
   making the collaborative response space more cooperative, thus providing
   support to communities rather than imposing limitations.},

Title = {Detecting and Coping with Disruptive Shocks in Arctic Marine Systems: A
   Resilience Approach to Place and People},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {It seems inevitable that the ongoing and rapid changes in the physical
   environment of the marine Arctic will push components of the region's
   existing social-ecological systems-small and large-beyond tipping points
   and into new regimes. Ongoing changes include warming, freshening,
   acidification, and alterations to food web structure. In anticipation we
   pose three distinct but interrelated challenges: (1) to explore existing
   connectivities within components of the marine system; (2) to seek
   indicators (if they exist) of approaching regime change through
   observation and modeling; and (3) to build functional resilience into
   existing systems through adaptation-oriented policy and to have in hand
   transformative options when tipping points are crossed and new
   development trajectories are required. Each of the above challenges is
   scale dependent, and each requires a much deeper understanding than we
   currently have of connectivity within existing systems and their
   response to external forcing. Here, we argue from a global perspective
   the need to understand the Arctic's role in an increasingly nonlinear
   world; then describe emerging evidence from new observations on the
   connectivity of processes and system components from the Canada Basin
   and subarctic seas surrounding northern North America; and finally posit
   an approach founded in ``resilience thinking{''} to allow northern
   residents living in small coastal communities to participate in the
   observation, adaption and-if necessary-transformation of the
   social-ecological system with which they live.},

Title = {Carbon stocks and biodiversity conservation on a small island: Pico (the
   Azores, Portugal)},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {196-207},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The loss of carbon storage and sequestration capacity has been
   increasingly assessed and analyzed worldwide as among the factors
   causing or amplifying climate change. Solutions that contribute to
   decreasing the release of carbon and increasing its sequestration,
   without compromising currently threatened ecosystems, are required,
   especially for small territories. This study focuses on the strategies
   to increase the resilience of small islands to these losses, including
   spatial management to prevent and adapt to climate change while
   preserving biodiversity. Changes in carbon storage on Pico Island
   (Azores, Portugal) between 1998 and 2013 were assessed using the InVEST
   (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) Carbon
   Storage and Sequestration model. Changes in carbon stocks caused by
   changes in land use during this period, and the stocks' relationships
   with protected areas and the quality of natural habitats on Pico Island,
   were analyzed. Bogs and Azorean endemic Macaronesian heaths store more
   carbon per ha. Alien species are invading natural areas, and their
   carbon values need to be carefully addressed. Results, however,
   indicated that simultaneously increasing carbon stocks (economical
   value) and protecting biodiversity (environmental value) is possible by
   adapted and discussed management actions. This study supports the
   strategies that promote the potential of the conservation of
   biodiversity for mitigating climate change. The proposed management
   guidelines can be applied to other Macaronesian islands and, with local
   adaptations, to other outermost regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Prepared for change? An assessment of the current state of knowledge to
   support climate adaptation for Australian fisheries},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {877-894},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fisheries and marine ecosystems are challenged globally by climate
   change with subsequent biological and socio-ecological implications.
   Adaptation represents one pathway by which management agencies can seek
   to ensure sustainability of these resources for societal well-being,
   particularly when based on strong scientific evidence. Here, we examined
   the extent of primary scientific literature that is currently available
   to inform climate adaption initiatives for Australian fisheries. This is
   achieved via a systematic literature review for 99 harvested Australian
   marine species, aimed at identifying primary scientific articles that
   reported new knowledge of climate-driven biological changes and/or
   socio-ecological implications. We then assessed the quantity of
   scientific literature against estimated relative climate sensitivity
   scores for each species (from a previous study), and investigated
   factors that may influence relative research effort. We found that
   two-thirds of species had no peer-reviewed climate-related literature
   available, and that research effort among Australian fisheries species
   is most closely related to the number of commercial fish stocks per
   species, and commercial catch weight. We also found that the south-east
   and western Australian regions had the most climate-related biological
   information to support climate adaptation in fisheries management.
   Nonetheless, although accumulating knowledge of the biological and
   socio-ecological implications of climate change is important, increasing
   knowledge alone is insufficient to maintain the productivity and
   profitability of Australian fisheries in light of projected climate
   impacts. We suggest that the further use of this knowledge to inform
   decision-making processes is essential to ensure that climate adaptation
   options are fully explored, to allow sustainable and productive
   fisheries.},

Title = {Adapt or Perish: A Review of Planning Approaches for Adaptation under
   Deep Uncertainty},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {955-979},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is increasing interest in long-term plans that can adapt to
   changing situations under conditions of deep uncertainty. We argue that
   a sustainable plan should not only achieve economic, environmental, and
   social objectives, but should be robust and able to be adapted over time
   to (unforeseen) future conditions. Large numbers of papers dealing with
   robustness and adaptive plans have begun to appear, but the literature
   is fragmented. The papers appear in disparate journals, and deal with a
   wide variety of policy domains. This paper (1) describes and compares a
   family of related conceptual approaches to designing a sustainable plan,
   and (2) describes several computational tools supporting these
   approaches. The conceptual approaches all have their roots in an
   approach to long-term planning called Assumption-Based Planning. Guiding
   principles for the design of a sustainable adaptive plan are: explore a
   wide variety of relevant uncertainties, connect short-term targets to
   long-term goals over time, commit to short-term actions while keeping
   options open, and continuously monitor the world and take actions if
   necessary. A key computational tool across the conceptual approaches is
   a fast, simple (policy analysis) model that is used to make large
   numbers of runs, in order to explore the full range of uncertainties and
   to identify situations in which the plan would fail.},

Abstract = {An integrated coastal zone management approach was used towards building
   adaptation strategies for the city of San Francisco de Campeche, Mexico.
   Large interannual variability in precipitation extremes have led to
   city-wide flooding in numerous occasions, threatening the population and
   city infrastructure. A special steering committee was appointed to
   coordinate an integrated coastal management plan within the three levels
   of government (federal, state and municipal) and to review the legal
   framework for water management. The municipal administration designed
   the blueprint for the project and an associated environmental education
   campaign. A pluvial drainage system was built to separate pluvial from
   domestic wastewater. Moreover, the wastewater drainage system was
   strengthened, and the city water treatment plants improved. As a result,
   water quality in the coastal zone improved and the city of San Francisco
   de Campeche was able to build its plan for adaptation to extreme rain
   events, which are increasingly frequent due to climate change.},

   in six climate-diverse cities},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {804},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are present in all cities, derived
   from their thermal properties. While looking at the spatiotemporal
   variability of land surface temperature (LST), there is still a gap in
   understanding patterns of change. In this paper, we analysed diurnal and
   nocturnal annual mean LST trends in continental (Beijing), temperate
   (Mexico City and Santiago), and arid (Cairo, Hyderabad, and Riyadh)
   cities employing 1 km MODIS data (2003-2019). Each time-series was
   assessed with the structure of a space-time cube. Hot and cold spots
   were detected for each year and the LST trends were analysed. Each pixel
   was classified into different space-time LST trends and their SUHIs were
   estimated. Cities exhibit trends of increasing temperatures in cold and
   hot spots for diurnal and nocturnal data. Temperatures are increasing
   faster in hot spots for diurnal and in cold spots for nocturnal scenes.
   Steady hot spots and warming hot spots exhibit the highest SUHIs for day
   and night. Our approach provides a framework to empirically delineate
   the spatial intraurban heterogeneity of LST patterns over time. This
   spatially explicit information provides insights into urban areas
   requiring heat mitigation strategies and can be used to monitor the
   performance of measures already implemented for climate adaptation. (c)

   cited in them, deal with the eight types of slow-onset events, specified
   by the UNFCCC: increasing temperatures, sea level rise, salinization,
   ocean acidification, glacial retreat, land degradation, desertification
   and loss of biodiversity. The authors used qualitative data analysis
   software to analyse the reports, and for each of the SOEs, they coded
   and analysed information about the state, rate of change, timescale,
   geography, drivers, impacts, management responses, adaptation limits and
   residual losses and damages. The paper provides an overview of the state
   of the art on SOEs and helps to identify gaps and challenges in
   understanding the nature of SOEs, their impact and effective management
   approaches.},

Title = {Assessment of Climate-Driven Flood Risk and Adaptation Supporting the
   Conservation Management Plan of a Heritage Site. The National Art
   Schools of Cuba},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This work illustrates the contribution of flood risk assessment and
   adaptation to set up a conservation management plan for a masterpiece of
   20th-century architecture. Case study is the iconic complex,
   internationally known as the National Art Schools of Cuba. It consists
   of five buildings built in the early 1960s within a park of Habana next
   to the Caribbean Sea. The path of the river (Rio Quibu) crossing the
   estate was modified to fit the landscape design. The complex has then
   been exposed to the risk of flooding. The School of Ballet, located in a
   narrow meander of the river, slightly upstream of a bridge and partially
   obstructing the flow, is particularly subject to frequent flash floods
   from the Rio Quibu, and it needs urgent restoration. Keeping ISA Modern
   is a project aimed at preserving the Schools complex. Based upon in situ
   surveys on the Rio Quibu and local area measurements during 2019,
   numerical modelling, and previous work by the Cuban National Institute
   of Hydraulic Resources, we pursued a flood risk analysis for the area,
   and a preliminary analysis of available risk reduction strategies. Using
   HEC-RAS 2D software for hydraulic modelling, we evaluated the flooded
   area and the hydraulic conditions (flow depth, velocity) for floods with
   given return periods. Our results show that SB is a building most
   subject to flooding, with high levels of risk. Defense strategies as
   designed by Cuban authorities may include a (new) wall around the School
   of Ballet and widening of the river channel, with high impact and cost,
   although not definitive. Temporary, light, permanent, and low
   cost/impact flood proofing structures may be used with similar
   effectiveness. We demonstrate that relatively little expensive hydraulic
   investigation may aid flood modelling and risk assessment in support of
   conservation projects for historically valuable sites. This may support
   brainstorming and the selection of (low to high cost) adaptation and
   risk reduction measures in the coastal areas of Cuba in response to ever
   increasing extreme storms and sea level rise controlling flood dynamics
   under transient climate change.},

Pages = {96-104},
Abstract = {Erratic monsoon and extreme climatic events cause considerable damage to
   life and property of the fishers in the country. Cuddalore District has
   been the worst affected of all districts in Tamil Nadu, in the recent
   past with the tsunami in 2004, cyclone Thane in 2011 and cyclone Neelam
   in 2012 creating a detrimental impact on coastal communities and their
   activities, particularly fishing. This in turn has affected their
   livelihood to a great extent. This coastal zone is largely low-lying
   with gentle slope, thus making it highly vulnerable to climate related
   changes. The vulnerability of this region to climate change and its
   devastating effects necessitates identifying vulnerability indices to
   assist in developing proactive policies by local government bodies in
   better disaster management. The vulnerability index of ten coastal
   villages of Cuddalore District was computed using Parameter, Attribute,
   Resilient indicator and Score ( PARS) method. The study showed that the
   Cuddalore coast is highly vulnerable to climate change and related sea
   level rise. The villages of Pettodai, Reddiarpettai and Sothikuppam of
   Cuddalore District were identified as most vulnerable. The outcome of
   this study will be of use in the protection of coastal livelihoods and
   planning better adaptation policies and mitigation plans.},

Abstract = {In coastal cities, the effects of climate change will cause an increase
   in the intensity and frequency of extreme sea level (ESL). In this
   scenario, the application of the Coast-RiskBySea model is proposed to
   assess the economic impacts of ESL on the built environment in three
   Euro-Mediterranean coastal cities: Naples, Barcelona, and Marseille. The
   risk (land use-based) is assessed in the GIS environment as a function
   of the potential direct and tangible economic damages. The results
   highlight risk scenarios in all three cities with significant economic
   damages expected, requiring the implementation of climate mitigation and
   adaptation measures to reduce the current impacts and limit future ones.
   The simulations highlight the potential of both remote sensing data and
   GIS systems to carry out homogeneous environmental analyses over wide
   areas. The results that were obtained are compared with existing works
   to verify the reliability of the Coast-RiskBySea model.},

Title = {Are coastal communities able to pay for the protection of fish resources
   impacted by climate change?},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {221},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine inhabitants' motivation and
   their willingness to pay to mitigate the impact of climate change on
   fish resources. Willingness to pay was tested empirically using survey
   data from 333 inhabitants of Sciacca, a fishing community in Sicily,
   Italy, which has the island's second largest fishing fleet. People's
   attitudes towards climate change, their degree of involvement in the
   issue, and their concerns about this phenomenon's potential impact on
   the marine environment are the key factors affecting their willingness
   to pay. It was further found that respondents are willing to pay an
   average of (sic)6.81 per month to support mitigation policies in the
   fishing industry. The originality of this study is related to its
   contribution in expanding the body of knowledge on citizens' willingness
   to pay for the protection of fish resources, using a conceptual
   framework based on the Construal Level Theory and the Theory of Reasoned
   Action to explain inhabitants' behaviour. The latter is one of the
   implications of this study on the theoretical point of view. In
   addition, this study provides insights and hints to policy makers to
   define tools, shared by the community, that contribute to the mitigation
   of climate change.},

Title = {Sea-level rise impacts on Africa and the effects of mitigation and
   adaptation: an application of DIVA},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {207-224},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper assesses sea-level rise impacts on Africa at continental and
   national scales including the benefits of mitigation and of applying
   adaptation measures, considering four scenarios of global mean sea-level
   rises from 64 to 126 cm in the period of 1995-2100. We find that in
   2100, 16-27 million people are expected to be flooded per year, and
   annual damage costs range between US\$ 5 and US\$ 9 billion, if no
   adaptation takes place. Mitigation reduces impacts by 11-36\%.
   Adaptation in the form of building dikes to protect against coastal
   flooding and nourishing beaches to protect against coastal erosion
   reduces the number of people flooded by two orders of magnitude and cuts
   damage costs in half by 2100. Following such a protection strategy would
   require substantial investment. First, Africa's current adaptation
   deficit with respect to coastal flooding would need to be addressed.
   DIVA suggests that a capital investment of US\$ 300 billion is required
   to build dikes adapted to the current surge regime and US\$ 3 billion
   per year for maintenance. In addition, between US\$ 2 and US\$ 6 billion
   per year needs to be spent on protecting against future sea-level rise
   and socio-economic development by 2100. This suggests that protection is
   not effective from a monetary perspective but may still be desirable
   when also taking into account the avoided social impact. We conclude
   that this issue requires further investigation including sub-national
   scale studies that look at impacts and adaptation in conjunction with
   the development agenda and consider a wider range of adaptation options
   and strategies.},

Title = {Indoor Summer Thermal Comfort in a Changing Climate: The Case of a
   Nearly Zero Energy House in Wallonia (Belgium)},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While the potential impact of climate change mitigation measures is well
   documented in building sciences literature, there are only relatively
   sparse studies focusing on the efficiency of adaptation strategies. This
   paper aims to contribute to this topic by evaluating the extent to which
   the design of a typical nearly Zero Energy Buildling (nZEB) house in
   Wallonia (Belgium), and its current operation, could provide summer
   thermal comfort in a changing climate. Based on calibrated whole
   building energy simulations, and on the integration of future climate
   data directly derived from a high-resolution climate model, this study
   evaluates the potential evolution of overheating risks in the living
   room and in the main bedroom of the house. Discussing the compliance
   with existing overheating criteria, the study shows that the passive
   strategies currently deployed in the house might not be sufficient to
   guarantee summer thermal comfort especially in the bedroom, and that
   other strategies might be necessary in the future to limit the use of
   active cooling systems and curb their environmental impacts. This study
   concludes that considering the potential of these strategies to
   guarantee summer thermal comfort in a changing climate should be a
   priority for the design of nZEB houses (and their related policies) also
   in temperate oceanic climates.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Thawing permafrost creates risks to the environment, economy and culture
   in Arctic coastal communities. Identification of these risks and the
   inclusion of the societal context and the relevant stakeholder
   involvement is crucial in risk management and for future sustainability,
   yet the dual dimensions of risk and risk perception is often ignored in
   conceptual risk frameworks. In this paper we present a risk framework
   for Arctic coastal communities. Our framework builds on the notion of
   the dual dimensions of risk, as both physically and socially
   constructed, and it places risk perception and the coproduction of risk
   management with local stakeholders as central components into the model.
   Central to our framework is the importance of multidisciplinary
   collaboration. A conceptual model and processual framework with a
   description of successive steps is developed to facilitate the
   identification of risks of thawing permafrost in a collaboration between
   local communities and scientists. Our conceptual framework motivates
   coproduction of risk management with locals in the identification of
   these risks from permafrost thaw and the development of adaptation and
   mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Planning for Climate Change Impacts on Geoheritage Interests in
   Protected and Conserved Areas},
Journal = {GEOHERITAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change presents challenges for the management of geoheritage at
   all scales from individual geosites to whole landscapes, and affecting
   all areas of the planet. Direct impacts will arise principally through
   the effects of climate changes on geomorphological processes and
   vegetation cover, while indirect impacts will result from hard
   engineering interventions to mitigate risks from natural hazards. We
   present an indicative framework that sets out key steps to help
   geoconservation practitioners and managers of all protected and
   conserved areas (PCAs) with geoheritage interests to assess and manage
   the impacts of climate change on geoheritage. Strategies for mitigation
   and adaptation to assist contingency planning and implementation should
   be supported by site condition monitoring and as far as possible work
   with nature, but will require to be adaptive in the face of many
   uncertainties. Our approach is based on assessment of the risk of
   degradation of geosites and their features and processes arising from
   the likelihood of climate change affecting them and the predicted
   severity of impacts. The risk of degradation of a site, feature or
   process will depend on (i) its geographic location and proximity to
   geomorphological systems that are likely to respond dynamically to
   climate changes; (ii) the magnitude, rate and duration of these changes;
   and (iii) intrinsic factors that include the geological and physical
   characteristics of the site and its features and processes. Management
   options range from non-intervention to planned interventions informed by
   the risk of degradation assessment. However, documentation for posterity
   may be the only practical option for geoheritage interests close to
   existential thresholds, such as small mountain glaciers, and sites at
   risk from sea-level rise and coastal or river erosion. Adaptation
   strategies for geoheritage in protected and conserved areas should, as
   far as practicable, align with those for biodiversity and aim to deliver
   multiple co-benefits for nature and people, although economic, social
   and political constraints may hinder implementation where wider
   stakeholder interests are involved. Managers of PCAs will need
   substantial input from geoconservation experts to carry out the
   assessments recommended and determine the action required.},

Title = {Managing Climate Risk in a Major Coffee-Growing Region of Indonesia},
Booktitle = {GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY: AGRICULTURE PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {147-205},
Abstract = {Indonesia is currently one of the top four coffee exporting countries in
   the world. Climate change is projected to cause significant impacts on
   coffee. Without proper adaptation measures, this will significantly
   lower the productions. Changes in rainfall and increases in temperature
   will affect the phenological development that would eventually influence
   yield and quality of crop including the potential risks of pest and
   disease attacks. Assessment in Toba, a major coffee--growing region of
   Indonesia, indicated that in the middle of this century (the 2050s),
   under climate scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, suitable areas for coffee
   production would decrease significantly. The average yield is projected
   to decrease between 25\% and 75\% of the current yield. However, the
   highlands that are currently not suitable for coffee (>1500 m above mean
   sea level) is projected to become suitable with a higher yield than the
   current. A significant increase in rainfall during the rainy season and
   prolonged dry season will also affect coffee phenological development.
   It will shift the peak of coffee flowering and harvesting seasons in
   Toba. The severity of the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei
   (Ferrari) attack will also increase in the future. The current crop
   management farming practices should be adjusted and improved to adapt to
   such change.},

Booktitle = {COMMUNITY PRACTICES FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN JAPAN},
Series = {Disaster Risk Reduction},
Year = {2014},
Pages = {227-238},
Abstract = {This chapter presents a case study of Saroma Lake fisheries by
   highlighting adaptive responses to risk reduction coupled with climate
   change. Saroma Lake is the southernmost area of seasonal sea ice
   distribution in the northern hemisphere. Changes in temperature are
   likely to impact negatively on the ice-covered ecosystem and fishing
   production in the lake where the fishers need to adapt to the impacts.
   The case study reveals that innovative efforts performed by the fishers
   and researchers have been made by applying community-based and
   scientific-oriented fisheries management. The fishers united together
   and built an integrated body, leading them to achieve cooperative
   fishery governance system. The system not only ensures a holistic
   approach to respond to changes in the lake ecosystem, but also reduces a
   range of risks through active use of scientific knowledge by employing
   full-time researchers in their structure as well as strengthening
   interactions between fishers and outside researchers. The employed
   researchers work on problems of interest to the fishers and search
   workable the solutions. Permanent or long-term residency can allow them
   to interpret concerns of the fishers and act in a leading role in the
   coordination of adaptive fisheries development. Based on the Saroma Lake
   experience, this chapter will provide potential initiatives to help
   develop a pathway for linking fisheries management to risk reduction.},

Title = {A Global Assessment of Climate Change Adaptation in Marine Protected
   Area Management Plans},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Marine protected area (MPA) efficacy is increasingly challenged by
   climate change. Experts have identified clear climate change adaptation
   principles that MPA practitioners can incorporate into MPA management;
   however, adoption of these principles in MPA management remains largely
   unquantified. We conducted a text analysis of 647 English-language MPA
   management plans to assess the frequency with which they included
   climate change-related terms and terms pertaining to ecological,
   physical, and sociological components of an MPA system that may be
   impacted by climate change. Next, we manually searched 223 management
   plans to quantify the plans' climate change robustness, which we defined
   as the degree of incorporation of common climate change adaptation
   principles. We found that climate change is inadequately considered in
   MPA management plans. Of all plans published since 2010, only 57\%
   contained at least one of the climate change-related terms, ``climate
   change,{''} ``global warming,{''} ``extreme events,{''} ``natural
   variability,{''} or ``climate variability.{''} The mean climate change
   robustness index of climate-considering management plans was 10.9 or
   39\% of a total possible score of 28. The United States was the only
   region that had plans with climate robustness indices of 20 or greater.
   By contrast, Canada lags behind other temperate jurisdictions in
   incorporating climate change adaptation analysis, planning, and
   monitoring into MPA management, with a mean climate change robustness
   index of 6.8. Climate change robustness scores have generally improved
   over time within the most common MPA designations in Oceania, the United
   Kingdom, and the United States, though the opposite is true in Canada.
   Our results highlight the urgent need for practitioners to incorporate
   climate change adaptation into MPA management in accordance with
   well-researched frameworks.},

Abstract = {On both local and global scales, the expectation of climate
   change-related adverse impacts and changing human vulnerabilities
   presents a novel challenge for the public health sector's adaptation.
   Our aim is to present ``transfrontier{''}eLearning as one of the
   effective case-and place-specific options towards adapting to climate
   change repercussions.
   Human societies and nature have always adjusted to climate variability
   and extreme weather events, but climate change is moving climate
   conditions outside the range of past human experiences. Although climate
   change will create advantages for some regions and subpopulations, it
   will adversely affect ecosystems, water resources, energy,
   transportation, population health, public security, and other sectors.
   Like other parts of the world, the province of Quebec (Canada) has not
   been spared by negative impacts related to these recent climate change
   conditions. For Quebecer public health professionals, climate change is
   a significant threat in learning to adapt to its negative effects on
   human health. These range from the direct effects of average warming and
   urban heat islands, ozone air pollution, wildfires, summer/winter
   storms, and UV exposures to the indirect effects resulting from changes
   in water supply or in vector-borne diseases. In particular, climate
   change affects mental and physical health trough modifications in the
   frequency, intensity and duration of extreme meteorological events.
   While the frequency of extreme cold events is expected to decrease, heat
   waves are increasing. Depending on the effectiveness and extent of
   adaptation options, heat-related morbidity and mortality could increase
   over coming decades. Another set of major impacts is related to warmer
   air temperatures and higher atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations,
   increasing pollen production and lengthening the pollen season.
   Faced with such major and varied effects, preparedness is crucial in
   public health. Two key messages are here highlighted: (1) a
   ``transfrontier{''}vision of eEcoLearning and knowledge
   transfer/translation is needed. We cannot satisfy ourselves with
   sectorial approaches in helping societies to adapt to climate change
   because of the complex interactions between these climatic changes and
   non-climatic factors such as demographics, economics, land use, and
   technology; (2) a sustained effort to educate actors from various
   sectors (health professionals and decision-makers; the public sector;
   the private sector; non-governmental organizations) and to inform the
   adult population, especially the younger generations, is crucial to
   promote a behavioural change.},

Title = {Practicing Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change: Lessons from Integrated
   Coastal Management},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-335},
Abstract = {The challenges faced in adapting to climate change present themselves
   with increasing urgency. Nowhere will these challenges be greater than
   in the developing world where often weak institutions and governance
   systems struggle to deal with mounting pressures from population growth,
   inadequate infrastructure, and diminishing or already depleted natural
   resources. This article synthesizes the many global climate change and
   other anthropogenic threats to coastal ecosystems and draws on lessons
   and good practices from global experience in integrated coastal
   management (ICM) that can be transferred to coastal adaptation to these
   challenges. The case is made that the process and best practices of ICM
   are not radically changed by applying a climate lens. For the most part,
   the good practices of planning and implementation coastal management
   measures apply equally to climate change as they do to other coastal
   issues. However, there are some new and important considerations that
   enter into planning and decision-making with respect to climate change.
   These considerations include the need for an even greater emphasis on
   nature-based coastal protection strategies and measures, more pronounced
   issues of uncertainty in decision-making, the need for a longer planning
   horizon, and the importance of including in the decision-making equation
   opportunities to mitigate the sources of climate change with adaptation
   measures.},

Title = {Maladaptive trajectories of change in Makira, Solomon Islands},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Trajectories of change are dynamic processes of individual, group and/or
   societal responses to change which create further change and responses,
   with outcomes that reflect the cumulative properties of those processes.
   Understanding trajectories of change is an important initial step for
   designing appropriate adaptation strategies because even though
   responses may enable people to cope with change in the short term, the
   accumulated responses of individuals can generate undesirable
   maladaptive outcomes over longer periods of time. This paper examines
   trajectories of change in Kahua, Solomon Islands, where people have
   traditionally relied on subsistence activities and have in the past been
   subsistence affluent. Participatory methods, including 76 focus group
   discussions in 38 communities with 821 individuals, were used to
   determine changes in the region and its drivers. A conceptual model was
   developed of the underlying feedback processes within the Kahua
   social-ecological system. The results show that communities are facing
   rapid and extensive changes. Most changes, however, are being driven by
   the two key drivers of population growth and a strong desire for
   monetary prosperity that act synergistically to generate stress in
   communities. People are generally responding by focusing on income
   generation, which is reinforcing stress in communities and resulting in
   maladaptive trajectories of change. The results suggest development
   policy in the Solomon Islands needs to: (1) take the challenges of
   population growth much more seriously; (2) place greater effort on
   development activities that reduce per capita impact on the environment;
   (3) improve management of the high expectations for monetary prosperity;
   (4) increase emphasis on wellbeing aspects of development rather than
   income generation per se, and (5) better align development with existing
   adaptation strategies to ensure that vulnerability to future global
   change does not increase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Drawing on multi-disciplinary literature (socio-ecological resilience,
   disaster management, and urban planning) this article seeks to uncover
   what are the knowledge systems that underpin existing flood management
   regimes and how they enable or constrain learning for future flood risks
   (sea level rise). The article is situated in a case study of flood and
   climate risk governance in Canada's Metro Vancouver region. Drawing on
   60 interviews with emergency managers, engineers, planners, and elected
   officials, and a regional survey of resilience practitioners, we
   identify distinct knowledge systems used for managing urban resilience.
   We find that technical hazard- and engineering-based knowledge that has
   maintained its supremacy over the past decades is being increasingly
   challenged through knowledge co-production. We find that formalized and
   shadow spaces for learning and collaborative problem-solving break down
   barriers and enable a collective search for flood resilience solutions
   across governance levels.},

Title = {Adaptation of North Atlantic Albacore Fishery to Climate Change: Yet
   Another Potential Benefit of Harvest Control Rules},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Fisheries are constrained by ecosystem productivity and management
   effectiveness. Climate change is already producing impacts on marine
   ecosystems through overall changes in habitats, productivity and
   increased variability of environmental conditions. The way how these
   will affect fisheries is under debate and, also there is uncertainty on
   the best course of action to mitigate climate change impacts on
   fisheries. Harvest control rules are sets of pre-agreed rules that can
   be used to determine catch limits periodically and describe how harvest
   is automatically controlled by management in relation to the state of
   some indicator of stock status. In 2017, the International Commission
   for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas adopted a harvest control rule
   for North Atlantic albacore. This harvest control rule was evaluated
   using Management Strategy Evaluation against the main sources of
   uncertainty inherent to this fishery. Here, we used the same framework
   to evaluate the robustness of the adopted rule against two types of
   potential climate change impacts on North Atlantic albacore dynamics.
   First, we evaluated how the control rule would perform in the event of
   overall changes in productivity in the North Atlantic and second,
   against increases in climate driven recruitment variability. Overall,
   our results suggest that the adopted harvest control rule is robust to
   these climate driven impacts and also suggests bounds at which the
   current management framework would be vulnerable to climate change.
   Throughout the manuscript we also discuss the potential of harvest
   control rules and harvest strategies to adapt fisheries management to a
   changing environment. Our main conclusion is that despite the many
   uncertainties on climate impacts on fisheries, efficient fisheries
   management and HCRs will be critical to ensure the sustainability of
   fisheries in the future.},

Title = {Policy-relevant indicators for mapping the vulnerability of urban
   populations to extreme heat events: A case study of Philadelphia},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {231-243},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The recent global increase in extreme heat events linked to climate
   change is projected to continue. The additive effect of urban heat
   islands from impervious surfaces and urban heat emissions (e.g., from
   transportation and building cooling) exacerbates extreme heat events in
   urban areas, exposing dense populations to extreme heat with
   implications for human health. Ground- and satellite-based data on urban
   and suburban temperatures and vegetation over a historical period can
   help identify temporal and geospatial trends in heat exposure. A set of
   indicators has been developed to map the exposure, social sensitivity,
   and vulnerability of urban populations to heat wave health impacts.
   Guided by an Advisory Group of local planners in the pilot city of
   Philadelphia, localized trends of increasing urban extreme heat events
   using MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, confirmed with urban
   and non-urban temperature monitor data were identified. For the
   Philadelphia study area, the number of heat-event days in the urban
   setting has increased from approximately 4 days in 1980 to almost 12
   days in 2013, while the non-urban setting has consistently experienced 5
   days of heat events per year across the time period. Warmer
   micro-climates with limited vegetative cooling and elevated LSTs were
   also identified. The exposure indicator was combined with areas of high
   social sensitivity (e.g., low-income and elderly) to create a
   vulnerability indicator, showing significant overlap between highly
   exposed and highly sensitive populations. As a measure of the adaptive
   capacity of local governments to reduce the urban heat island, evidence
   of targeted vegetation increases or reduced localized temperatures
   linked to urban greening and cooling programs were sought, though none
   were of a scale to be identified by the 1 km satellite data utilized.
   The indicators have helped local decision makers to understand patterns
   of vulnerability, and may be used in the future to target adaptation
   actions and measure results (LST reduction or vegetation increase) from
   existing adaptation actions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners have long noted the importance of community
   resilience to disaster recovery and environmental risk mitigation. Yet
   we know surprisingly little about how local residents perceive the
   resilience of their local communities, including how closely their
   perceptions align with objective measures of resilience or whether these
   perceptions affect community engagement and support for resilience
   building activities and policies. In this paper, we utilise the results
   of public opinion surveys of residents of four Texas coastal shoreline
   counties (Brazoria, Nueces, Galveston, and Cameron) to address this gap
   in the literature. The results reveal that perceptions of community
   preparedness largely reflect social trust and disaster awareness while
   perceptions of recovery reflect perceived risks and preparedness.},

Abstract = {The sustainability of global seafood supply to meet increasing demand is
   facing several challenges, including increasing consumption levels due
   to a growing human population, fisheries resources over-exploitation and
   climate change. Whilst growth in seafood production from capture
   fisheries is limited, global mariculture production is expanding.
   However, climate change poses risks to the potential seafood production
   from mariculture. Here, we apply a global mariculture production model
   that accounts for changing ocean conditions, suitable marine area for
   farming, fishmeal and fish oil production, farmed species dietary
   demand, farmed fish price and global seafood demand to project
   mariculture production under two climate and socio-economic scenarios.
   We include 85 farmed marine fish and mollusc species, representing about
   70\% of all mariculture production in 2015. Results show positive global
   mariculture production changes by the mid and end of the 21(st) century
   relative to the 2000s under the SSP1-2.6 scenario with an increase of
   17\%+/- 5 and 33\%+/- 6, respectively. However, under the SSP5-8.5
   scenario, an increase of 8\%+/- 5 is projected, with production peaking
   by mid-century and declining by 16\%+/- 5 towards the end of the 21(st)
   century. More than 25\% of mariculture-producing nations are projected
   to lose 40\%-90\% of their current mariculture production potential
   under SSP5-8.5 by mid-century. Projected impacts are mainly due to the
   direct ocean warming effects on farmed species and suitable marine
   areas, and the indirect impacts of changing availability of forage
   fishes supplies to produce aquafeed. Fishmeal replacement with
   alternative protein can lower climate impacts on a subset of finfish
   production. However, such adaptation measures do not apply to regions
   dominated by non-feed-based farming (i.e. molluscs) and regions losing
   substantial marine areas suitable for mariculture. Our study highlights
   the importance of strong mitigation efforts and the need for different
   climate adaptation options tailored to the diversity of mariculture
   systems, to support climate-resilient mariculture development.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the impact of place loss due to the loss of a beach
   from coastal erosion in the community of Courtown, Co. Wexford, Ireland.
   Using in-depth walking interviews and photo-elicitation, we investigate
   (i) the experiences and emotional challenges of place loss; (ii) the
   impacts of place loss and adaptive actions on people-place relationships
   and; (iii) how individuals re-imagine the future of place following
   loss. We find that place loss results in emotional responses consistent
   with solastalgia for many interviewees. Adaptation actions in the form
   of installation of rock armour to deal with coastal erosion were seen by
   many as undesirable and amplified the sense of loss experienced. For
   most, the lack of community engagement in decision-making has created a
   sense of powerlessness and anxiety around the future of place. Moreover,
   this sense of powerlessness is amplified for many by concurrent but
   unrelated policies that incentivised rapid residential development in
   the area, contributing to changing place identity and community
   cohesion. Our findings highlight that impacts of environmental change
   and adaptation on individuals, while significant on their own, unfold
   within and can be amplified by the context of on-going development
   issues and decision-making processes. Despite their sense of
   powerlessness, there is evidence that residents see rich opportunities
   to re-imagine place if decision-makers can create opportunities to
   incorporate the voice of local communities.},

Title = {Applying the global RCP-SSP-SPA scenario framework at sub-national
   scale: A multi-scale and participatory scenario approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {635},
Pages = {659-672},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {To better anticipate potential impacts of climate change, diverse
   information about the future is required, including climate, society and
   economy, and adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, a global
   RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways), SSP (Shared Socio-economic
   Pathways), and SPA (Shared climate Policy Assumptions) (RCP-SSP-SPA)
   scenario framework has been developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR5). Application of this
   full global framework at sub-national scales introduces two key
   challenges: added complexity in capturing the multiple dimensions of
   change, and issues of scale. Perhaps for this reason, there are few such
   applications of this new framework. Here, we present an integrated
   multi-scale hybrid scenario approach that combines both expert-based and
   participatory methods. The framework has been developed and applied
   within the DECCMA(1) project with the purpose of exploring migration and
   adaptation in three deltas across West Africa and South Asia: (i) the
   Volta delta (Ghana), (ii) the Mahanadi delta (India), and (iii) the
   Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta (Bangladesh/India). Using a
   climate scenario that encompasses a wide range of impacts (RCP8.5)
   combined with three SSP-based socio-economic scenarios (SSP2, SSP3,
   SSP5), we generate highly divergent and challenging scenario contexts
   across multiple scales against which robustness of the human and natural
   systems within the deltas are tested. In addition, we consider four
   distinct adaptation policy trajectories: Minimum intervention, Economic
   capacity expansion, System efficiency enhancement, and System
   restructuring, which describe alternative future bundles of adaptation
   actions/measures under different socio-economic trajectories. The paper
   highlights the importance of multi-scale (combined top-down and
   bottom-up) and participatory (joint expert-stakeholder) scenario methods
   for addressing uncertainty in adaptation decision-making. The framework
   facilitates improved integrated assessments of the potential impacts and
   plausible adaptation policy choices (including migration) under
   uncertain future changing conditions. The concept, methods, and
   processes presented are transferable to other sub-national
   socio-ecological settings with multi-scale challenges. (C) 2018

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Despite rising attention to pathways thinking in multiple domains such
   as climate adaptation, energy supply planning, and flood risk
   management, their spatial translation is so far understudied. We set out
   to study how spatial design based on pathways thinking can help develop
   more adaptive and sustainable landscapes. Using landscape analysis,
   field research, and research-through-designing in a case study on
   climate resilience in Boston (USA), we argue for better understanding of
   the spatial and design consequences of pathways in general. Our results
   indicate that pathways can be spatially translated, demanding
   landscape-informed choices when sequencing different policy actions. We
   found that spatial designing makes the landscape consequences of
   pathways transparent and enables policy-makers to replace the input of
   policy actions with spatial interventions, select pathways according to
   different underlying design strategies, use the mapped pathways to
   initiate an iterative research-through-designing process to test and
   inform different designs, and spatially visualize the pathways and
   possible sequences of actions. We conclude that policy-makers should be
   cognizant about the spatial implications of pathways and offer
   directions to enrich applications of pathways thinking for achieving
   adaptive and sustainable landscapes.},

Volume = {140},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {399-412},

Abstract = {Co-benefits are seen as a key factor for overcoming the problems of
   collective action and extended time horizons holding back mitigation of
   global warming. The mechanism behind this hypothesis is that public
   acceptance of mitigation policies constitutes a crucial limiting factor,
   necessitating ancillary gains such as clean air for mitigation policy to
   be politically robust. However, the public's preference for local
   pollution mitigation and concomitant failure to appreciate the benefits
   of global warming mitigation is assumed rather than demonstrated. In
   this paper, we show, first, that people distinguish between the physical
   manifestations of air pollution and global warming, and second, that
   they see both phenomena as arising from the same causes as well as
   having negative impacts on humans. Specifically, using a survey
   experimental design with open-ended questions in an urban Chinese
   setting, we demonstrate that citizens relate glacier melt and sea-level
   rise to global warming, while linking the local phenomenon of smog
   almost exclusively to air pollution. At the same time, respondents link
   impacts on humans and vehicle/industrial pollution topics with both air
   pollution and global warming. These findings are relevant to
   decision-makers as they suggest that the public values mitigation of
   global warming in its own right. Our novel method may shed new light on
   a range of issues relating to energy, the economy, and environmental
   issues.},

   adaptation policies and interventions frequently privilege Western
   scientific knowledge and focus on addressing individual climate risks
   through technical fixes directed by foreign experts and funding
   agencies. They are also rooted in a policy architecture that is an
   artefact of colonisation in the region. Despite these obstacles, Pacific
   Islander responses to climate change are dynamic, and inclusive of the
   multiple and competing ontologies they work within, offering insights
   into how Euromodern and Pacific islander world views could coalesce to
   builds adaptive capacity and consolidate community resilience into the
   future. Highlights center dot Indigenous Knowledge plays a critical role

   The study finds that social learning occurred more prominently at the
   individual stakeholder level and less at the collective level. For Tidal
   River Management to be responsive and sustainable, especially in times
   of increased uncertainty and climate vulnerability, more attention needs
   to be paid to coordination and facilitation of multi-level learning that

Title = {Indicators for strategic environmental assessment in regional land use
   planning to assess conflicts with adaptation to global climate change},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {90-95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The paper presents the use of indicators in a site-specific assessment
   method for strategic environmental assessment in regional land use
   planning (here: SEA-REP). It is explained with the example of the state
   of environment indicator `LUCCA 4 Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding', how
   SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of
   conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change.
   The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In
   the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption,
   land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem
   during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to
   climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds
   was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land
   and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental
   orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental
   policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the
   derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described.
   Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations
   on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future
   adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations
   of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood
   risk. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation Strategies Vary With Climatic Stress: Evidence
   From Three Regions of Vietnam},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Vietnam faces several adverse climatic stresses such as increases in
   temperature, drought, flooding, saltwater intrusion, and sea-level rise.
   Past research on climate change adaptation in Vietnam has highlighted
   that climatic stresses and challenges faced by populations vary across
   the country. In this study, we are interested to know if autonomous
   responses also vary, depending on which stress individuals are
   responding to. To answer this question, we use primary-collected data of
   1,306 individuals from the Mekong River Delta, Central Vietnam, and the
   Red River Delta. Adaptation choices of these individuals are analyzed at
   two levels: the household-level and the agricultural-level. We estimate
   multivariate probit models by Geweke-Hajivassilou-Keane (GHK) simulated
   maximum likelihood methods. Our results show that climate change
   adaptations vary depending on which stresses individuals are responding
   to. At the household level, droughts and floods have the strongest
   effect on climate change adaptation. However, adaptations at the
   agricultural level depend more on the impacts of the stress and less so
   on the climatic strss itself. Understanding what climatic stresses are
   already eliciting a response, and what adaptations are being used by
   individuals, is invaluable for designing successful climate change
   policies. This understanding can also help policymakers identify where
   gaps exist in individual climate change adaptations and fill these gaps
   with a public response.},

Title = {The importance of farmers' perceptions of salinity and adaptation
   strategies for ensuring food security: Evidence from the coastal rice
   growing areas of Bangladesh},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {727},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Coastal salinity causes substantial adverse impacts on agricultural
   productivity and food security. Farmers' choice of salinity adaptation
   strategies might depend on how they perceive the problem. This research
   examined rice farmers' perceptions of salinity, adaptation strategies,
   and its implications for policy initiatives to sustain rice production
   in the affected coastal areas of Bangladesh. Boro rice growers (n = 109)
   randomly selected from two coastal sub-districts were interviewed using
   a semi-structured survey. Awareness of salinity and its increase over
   the past 20 years was widespread among rice farmers. A high proportion
   of farmers (90\%) perceived the reproductive (e.g. booting, heading, and
   flowering) stages of the rice plant as the most sensitive to salinity
   problems. Salinity (ECe) was measured in the farmers' fields and were
   categorized according to farmers' perceptions and scientific
   interpretation (e.g. high or low). Farmers perceived a field affected by
   high salinity at a lower EC reading than the scientific interpretation
   of the salinity level. Most of the farmers (67\%) were undertaking early
   transplanting and applying irrigation in order to adapt to salinity
   problems which occur later in rice crop growth during Boro season. Thus,
   farmers' actions demonstrated that their perceptions of salinity and
   adaptation responses were pre-emptive of when salinity was most likely
   to have an impact on the rice crop. Farmers' perceptions of salinization
   and measures to manage salinity need to be considered in research
   prioritization and policy formulation by the government. This action
   could potentially secure rice production and thus contribute to the
   achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-1, 2 and 3). (C) 2020

Abstract = {Urban open space provides various benefits to citizens, but the thermal
   environment of this space is impacted by global warming and urban heat
   islands. A growing number of studies have been conducted on strategies
   for improving the urban thermal environment and attracting more people
   to outdoor spaces. This paper reviews the mechanisms and cooling effects
   of four major mitigation strategies, namely, changing the urban
   geometry, planting vegetation, using cool surface, and incorporating
   bodies of water. Our review found that on summer days these four
   strategies yielded a median reduction in air temperature of 2.1 K, 2.0
   K, 1.9 K, and 1.8 K, respectively. In terms of integrated effect on
   thermal comfort, changing the urban geometry provided the greatest
   improvement, with the largest reduction in physiologically equivalent
   temperature (PET) in summer (median Delta PET = 18.0 K). The use of
   vegetation and water bodies reduced the median PET by 13.0 K and 4.6 K,
   respectively. However, some simulation studies found that reflective
   surface led to higher PET in summer because of the increased amount of
   reflected solar radiation. The mitigation strategies improved the urban
   thermal environment to a greater extent in hotter and drier climates.
   Vegetation, cool surface, and water bodies provided less cooling in
   compact urban spaces than in open areas. The results that we reviewed
   can be used by designers and planners seeking to create thermally
   comfortable urban open spaces. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Effectiveness assessment of risk reduction measures at coastal areas
   using a decision support system: Findings from Emma storm},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {657},
Pages = {124-135},

Abstract = {Storms impact coastal areas often causing damages and losses at occupied
   areas. On a scenario of increasing human occupation at coastal zones and
   under climate change conditions (including sea level rise and increasing
   frequency of extreme sea levels), the consequences of storms arc
   expected to be amplified if no adaptation or further management actions
   are implemented. The selection of the best possible coastal management
   measures, considering both costs and effectiveness, will be mandatory in
   the future, in order to optimise resources. This work analyses the
   performance of risk reduction measures (beach nourishment and receptors
   - house and infrastructures - removal), using a decision support system
   comprised by a morphodynamic numerical model (XBeach) and a Bayesian
   network based on the source-pathway-receptor concept. The effectiveness
   of the risk reduction measures is then assessed by a simple index
   expressing the consequences to the receptors. The approach was tested at
   Faro Beach by evaluating its performance for a particular storm, Emma
   (Feb/March 2018), which fiercely impacted the southern coast of
   Portugal. The output results from the modelling were compared to field
   observations of the actual damages caused by the storm. The combined use
   of both measures or the solely use of the nourishment would avoid almost
   all observed impacts from this storm. The work is pioneer on
   demonstrating the use of a decision support system for coastal regions
   validated against observed impacts for a high-energy storm event. The
   methodology and the proposed index arc adaptable to any sandy coastal
   region and can be used to test (and improve) management options at a
   broad number of coastal areas worldwide, minimizing implementation costs
   and reducing the risk to the occupation and to the people. (C) 2018

Abstract = {This paper focuses on urban planning strategies to adapt cities to the
   increasing rising of temperatures during summer heat waves. The main
   target is to investigate which configuration and distribution pattern of
   green spaces could effectively improve natural cooling of urban
   environments. Although the benefit that green areas give to natural
   cooling is well known, this kind of studies has hardly been carried out,
   especially at an urban scale where it is crucial to define quantities
   and density of green areas to address open spaces design. To reach this
   goal, a methodology based on the interpretation of the statistical
   correlation among temperature, urban parameters and green areas
   configurational indicators was implemented and applied to the case study
   of Naples metropolitan area, performing all the analysis in a GIS.
   Results provide guidelines to improve natural cooling in urban areas
   adopting the most effective configuration and distribution of green
   areas within a densely built context.},

Abstract = {Floods and shoreline retreat in coastal areas threaten many millions of
   people across Europe. Moreover, it is agreed that climate change can
   amplify the magnitude and frequency of flooding events and accelerate
   the shoreline retreat. The main goal of this work is to assess flood and
   shoreline retreat risk, and define adaptation strategies under present
   conditions and future climate change scenarios on the Ria de Aveiro and
   its littoral. The hydrodynamic model ELCIRC was implemented for the Ria
   de Aveiro lagoon and GENESIS (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) and LTC
   (Long-Term Configuration) shoreline evolution models for the littoral
   stretch between Esmoriz and Mira. Numerical results in present and
   future scenarios were used to map the flooded lagoon extension and the
   shoreline evolution of this coastal stretch. Analysis showed an increase
   of the lagoon's flooded area, relative to the present, with regions more
   exposed to sea level rise being lowland areas located at the margins of
   the lagoon's deeper channels. Examination of the littoral stretch showed
   a slight increasing trend of shoreline retreat under predicted future
   climate change scenarios, thereby increasing the probability of sand
   spit rupture. Data from numerical predictions were integrated into
   Geographical Information Systems covering the coastal and lagoon study
   areas, and produced hazard and risk maps including the identification of
   regional use and activities. Structural and non-structural measures were
   subsequently developed in order to mitigate flood and shoreline retreat
   effects.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a phenomenon of concern not only to countries in the
   Arab World but also to all countries all over the world, though the Arab
   region is at a disadvantage due to its predisposition to harsh climatic
   conditions. The energy sector is the main contributor to climate change,
   which in turn results in changes in water quality and quantity, sea
   level, human health, food production, tourism and security. Arab World
   counties have attempted to adapt to or mitigate the effects of climate
   change; but there are numerous challenges that they must overcome in
   order to keep up with these changes. Some mitigation factors in the
   industrial sector and building sector, mainly those in search of
   substitute fuels to oil are far-reaching if the countries can cooperate
   in their efforts. Since the area has resources to implement
   comprehensive changes, it is recommended that stakeholders work together
   in order to achieve synchrony in their efforts. (C) 2013 The Authrs.

Title = {Temperature-dependent metabolism in Antarctic fish: Do habitat
   temperature conditions affect thermal tolerance ranges?},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-149},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climatic warming is most pronounced in the polar regions. For marine
   ectotherms such as fish, temperature is a key abiotic factor,
   influencing metabolic processes. Species distribution and abundance are
   driven by reproduction and growth, which depend on available energy
   exceeding baseline maintenance costs. These routine metabolic costs make
   up a large part of the energy expenditure. Thermal stress can increase
   routine metabolism, affecting an organism's fitness. Data of routine
   metabolic rates of Antarctic fish are scarce, and comparability of
   existing data sets is often problematic due to ecological differences
   between species and in experimental protocols. Our objective was to
   compare routine metabolism and thermal sensitivity of species with
   similar ecotypes but different thermal environments to assess possible
   ecological implications of warming waters on energy expenditure in
   Antarctic fish, a fauna characterised by geographic isolation, endemism
   and putative thermal adaptation. We measured routine metabolic rates of
   three benthic Antarctic fish species from low- and high-Antarctic
   regions at habitat temperature and during acute temperature increase.
   Our analysis revealed differences in metabolic rates at the same
   temperature suggesting local adaptation to habitat temperature. Acute
   thermal stress induced a comparable response of metabolic rates to
   increasing temperature. We conclude that higher metabolic rates and thus
   higher energetic costs could be associated with narrower thermal
   windows, a potential disadvantage to the endemic high-Antarctic fish
   fauna facing the challenge of climate change.},

Title = {Predicting fisheries bycatch: A case study and field test for pilot
   whales in a pelagic longline fishery},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {909-923},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim Fisheries bycatch is a major threat to populations of protected
   species such as marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles, and static
   management approaches are often unsuccessful in mitigating bycatch of
   these highly mobile species. Combining species distribution models
   (SDMs) with oceanographic data has been proposed as a means of
   predicting when and where bycatch is likely to occur. However, studies
   assessing whether SDMs can accurately predict fisheries bycatch using
   independent data are lacking. Assessing model performance using
   independent data is necessary to test whether a model is generalizable,
   and this is particularly important for models with management
   applications. Here, we use short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala
   macrorhynchus) bycatch in a pelagic longline fishery as a case study to
   inform efforts to mitigate fisheries bycatch. Location Offshore waters,
   north-east United States. Methods We integrated telemetry and
   oceanographic data using mixed-effects generalized additive models to
   predict pilot whale occurrence and assessed model performance using
   k-folds cross-validation. We then evaluated the model's ability to
   predict pilot whale bycatch using data from independent on-board
   observers. Results The model performed well, and predictions were
   strongly and significantly correlated with observed rates of bycatch in
   space and time. Temperature and proximity to mesoscale oceanographic
   features (thermal fronts and sea level anomalies) were important
   predictors of pilot whale occurrence, and as a result, spatial
   predictions of the risk of bycatch varied through time. Main conclusions
   Our findings demonstrate that SDMs can be used to accurately predict
   times and places with a high risk of bycatch, and illustrate that models
   using dynamic oceanographic variables can identify smaller, more
   specific focal management regions than static management approaches.
   Combining SDMs with near real-time or forecasted environmental
   conditions could provide a promising tool for decreasing bycatch and
   will be valuable in developing adaptive management strategies to
   mitigate fisheries bycatch of protected species.},

Title = {Space poverty driving heat stress vulnerability and the adaptive
   strategy of visiting urban parks},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change and urbanisation have exacerbated social inequities.
   Increasing urban heat has made high density housing units a
   vulnerability hotspot. Alternatives to extended air-conditioning are
   required. This research sought evidence on using urban parks as a
   sustainable alternative by low-income households deprived of adequate
   living space. We interviewed occupants of tiny flats (approx. 10 m(2)),
   known as subdivided units, and compared their park visiting routines and
   thermal comfort practices with other urban dwellers in Hong Kong. The
   substandard conditions of these small units have contributed to
   dwellers' sensitivity and lower capacity to adapt to summer heat,
   resulting in heat-related illness. The space-poor households have taken
   a wider range of adaptive actions and visited urban parks more
   frequently for cooling. Their higher mobility between home and nearby
   parks has shortened their home-stay time that would otherwise demand
   residential space cooling. The findings are important for reconsidering
   and redressing the uneven distribution of urban green spaces. Poor
   housing conditions and heat stress have forced disadvantaged households
   to seek refuge from natural cool spaces, such as vegetated and shaded
   areas of urban parks. Measures for increasing their accessibility,
   availability and capacity for heat mitigation are conducive to pro-poor
   and pro-climate spatial planning.},

Abstract = {Tropical cyclones and their devastating impacts are of great concern to
   coastal communities globally. An appropriate approach integrating
   climate change scenarios at local scales is essential for producing
   detailed risk models to support cyclone mitigation measures. This study
   developed a simple cyclone risk-modelling approach under present and
   future climate change scenarios using geospatial techniques at local
   scales, and tested using a case study in Sarankhola Upazila from coastal
   Bangladesh. Linear storm-surge models were developed up to 100-year
   return periods. A local sea level rise scenario of 0.34 m for the year
   2050 was integrated with surge models to assess the climate change
   impact. The resultant storm-surge models were used in the risk-modelling
   procedures. The developed risk models successfully identified the
   spatial extent and levels of risk that match with actual extent and
   levels within an acceptable limit of deviation. The result showed that
   cyclone risk areas increased with the increase of return period. The
   study also revealed that climate change scenario intensified the cyclone
   risk area by 5-10\% in every return period. The findings indicate this
   approach has the potential to model cyclone risk in other similar
   coastal environments for developing mitigation plans and strategies.},

   coastal communities},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Municipalities are key agents in the transition to sustainability, and
   yet we have poorly developed theories and practices for how to
   facilitate the use of climate information by local governments in
   adapting to climate change. Existing research suggests that climate
   information is more likely to lead to adaptation actions when it is
   coproduced by researchers and policy makers because doing so increases
   the likelihood that the content of information is credible, salient, and
   legitimate. In this study, we explored how the coproduction process
   facilitated or hindered use of information from two climate adaptation
   projects in coastal New Hampshire. Based on 17 interviews and document
   review, we found that, contrary to expectations, highly engaged
   coproduction of knowledge may not be necessary due, in part, to
   preexisting trust among New Hampshire coastal municipalities, technical
   service providers, and researchers. However, we found in small towns
   with limited capacity, even the best climate knowledge is unlikely to be
   used without ongoing context-specific implementation assistance. Our
   research provides both practical recommendations for those actively
   advancing climate adaptation, as well as contributions to the
   undertheorized third phase of transdisciplinary research in which
   knowledge is translated to action.},

Title = {How climate change has affected the spatio-temporal patterns of
   precipitation and temperature at various time scales in North Korea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {722-734},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Detecting changes in the spatio-temporal patterns of temperature and
   precipitation is a prerequisite for developing effective adaptation
   options and strategies for the future. An effective method for assessing
   climate change and for providing information to decision makers and
   stakeholders is needed to implement appropriate adaptation strategies.
   The objective of this study was to determine whether climate change has
   caused spatio-temporal changes in meteorological elements in North
   Korea. We delineated the spatio-temporal patterns of temperature and
   precipitation caused by climate change in specific time periods based on
   statistically significant differences using a statistically robust
   method. Historical weather data from 27 meteorological stations over a
   30-year period (1981-2010) were used. The results demonstrated that
   statistically significant changes occurred over the 30 years. The
   temporal trends in the maximum and minimum temperatures were highly
   significantly different in the western agricultural regions and
   central/southwest urban regions during 1996-2010 compared with
   1981-1995. The precipitation amounts were significantly different in the
   southeast regions (around the coast). The numbers of precipitation
   events were significantly different for portions of the northern and
   northeast areas near the mountains. Additionally, statistically
   significant differences in the spatial structures of the temperature and
   precipitation were found at different time scales. The significant
   differences were not uniform in each season/month. Therefore,
   significant differences occurred in the meteorological elements, and
   particular locations and urbanized areas were affected by global
   warming. However, the temporal trends and spatial structures of each
   meteorological element were not equally modified; the meteorological
   changes occurred locally as a result of the changing climate.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {52-58},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a conceptual model for the scuba diving tourism
   system (SDTS). A holistic view was adopted to highlight the central
   elements of scuba diving tourism (SDT). Specifically, the paper examines
   the key components in the SDTS along with issues which challenge the
   sustainability of SDT. Scuba divers, the marine environment, the host
   community and the scuba diving tourism industry (including all
   associated industries) are fundamental elements of the SDTS. Notably,
   the host community is often overlooked as a key stakeholder in the
   management and sustainability of SDT at the destination. A systems
   approach used to conceptualise the SDTS highlights the need for adaptive
   management and leadership to encourage future orientated thinking and
   the integration of stakeholder concerns and perspectives to ensure the
   sustainability of marine resources and experiences. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Climate urbanism is an emerging field of action that aims to adapt to or
   mitigate the impacts of climate change on cities. These interventions
   are often framed by narratives of climate collapse, implying that there
   is not enough time to engage citizens in participatory planning
   processes. Some scholars have argued that this may also enable the
   realization of urban interventions that would otherwise be difficult to
   implement under ordinary circumstances. At the same time, research has
   demonstrated that mitigation and adaptation policies and projects may
   result in the displacement of vulnerable populations. To avoid this
   scenario, city governments must ensure vulnerability assessments,
   transparency, and accountability to all affected communities throughout
   the design process, and examination of projects proposed by residents
   and developed by the city authorities. Based on interviews, fieldwork
   observation, and secondary analysis of open-source documents, this
   article examines the complexity of appropriate urban climate planning
   through a comparative analysis. Taking the East Side Coast Resilience
   (ESCR) project in New York as an exemplary case study, we analyze
   multiple perspectives, expertise, and rights involved in climate
   urbanism in global cities under the neoliberal present. We conclude that
   democratic city planning for climate change cannot be separated from
   questions of climate justice, which concerns democratic decision making
   and the impact of interventions on local communities and ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island effect often produces an increase of overheating
   sensation inside of buildings. To evacuate this heat, the current use of
   air conditioning increases the energy consumption of buildings. As a
   good alternative, natural ventilation is one of the best strategies to
   obtain indoor comfort conditions, even in summer season, if buildings
   and urban designs are appropriated. In this work, the overheating risk
   of a small house is evaluated in four South American cities: Guayaquil,
   Lima, Antofagasta and Valparaiso, with and without considering the UHI
   effect. Then, natural ventilation is assessed in order to understand the
   capability of this passive strategy to assure comfort inside the house.
   Results show that an important portion of the indoor heat can be
   evacuated, however the temperature rising (especially during the night)
   due to UHI can generate a saturation effect if appropriate technical
   solutions, like the increase in the air speed that can be obtained with
   good urban design, are not considered.},

   practices, this paper builds on theories of growth coalitions and
   climate change imaginaries, identifying forms of resilience that promote
   an ascendant competitive resilience regime. The most proactive firms
   treat resilience as a competitive advantage to be gained through
   self-reliant or networked adaptation. As firms act to limit financial
   exposure and protect their assets, the resulting piecemeal, competitive
   resilience further accentuates uneven risk and uneven development. While
   it may hold short-term promise, this approach contributes to larger
   trends in neoliberal urban governance, threatening to undermine the
   potential for more transformative regional adaptation. However, given
   municipal resource constraints, it could become a common and damaging
   form of urban adaptation.},

Title = {The regional fingerprint: A new tool to evaluate adaptive capacity},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {36-46},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate changes and associated impacts are placing pressure on
   institutions and the professionals working within them to become
   proactive and to plan for more extreme impacts in distant futures.
   Despite a growing recognition of the need for climate adaptation action,
   there are limited assessment frameworks and strategic evaluation
   resources to support our understanding of regional adaptive capacity. We
   build on the literature and on information provided by climate
   adaptation experts to design a multi-criterion framework called the
   Regional Fingerprint. This framework consists of five critical
   categories - adopted actions, institutional capacity, research quality,
   planning processes, and regional collaboration - and twenty-one
   evaluation criteria. The framework is designed to uncover asymmetries
   between places, identify opportunities for intervention, and track
   progress in adaptive capacity. We further applied this framework to
   regions in California to test its viability and glean insights into the
   framework's capacity to generate new and useful policy relevant
   information. Through this work we find that the Regional Fingerprint
   offers insights into adaptive capacity and can be used to highlight
   critical areas for strategic intervention by state and local planners.},

Title = {Drought periods driving bioinvasion on hard substrates at a tropical
   estuary, Eastern Brazil},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {160},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {During drier periods estuarine salinization can stimulate the
   colonization of marine organisms and further bioinvasion, therefore, may
   cause future ecological change. In this sense, we applied the Rapid
   Assessment Surveys (RAS) on natural and artificial hard substrates
   during the most intense drought period (between 2014 and 2016) since
   1950, in a tropical estuary in Eastern Brazil. Through the estuary
   salinization the ascidian Didemnum psammatodes overgrow the dominant
   native taxa; this dominance taxa shift provided suitable habitat
   favorable for invasion of Ophiothela mirabilis across the estuary. Even
   the invasion starts on artificial substrates, the higher resilience of
   natural substrates were not enough to enable the establishment of
   invasive species. This baseline is the first evidence of bioinvasion
   influenced by climate change drought periods in tropical estuaries in
   South America, which is a great advance for the development of
   management strategies to mitigate this and future climate change
   scenarios.},

Number = {5},
Pages = {1851-1869},
Abstract = {This study presents the development of tools for the sustainable thermal
   management of a shallow unconsolidated urban groundwater body in the
   city of Basel (Switzerland). The concept of the investigations is based
   on (1) a characterization of the present thermal state of the urban
   groundwater body, and (2) the evaluation of potential mitigation
   measures for the future thermal management of specific regions within
   the groundwater body.
   The investigations focus on thermal processes downgradient of thermal
   groundwater use, effects of heated buildings in the subsurface as well
   as the thermal influence of river-groundwater interaction. Investigation
   methods include (1) short-and long-term data analysis, (2)
   high-resolution multilevel groundwater temperature monitoring, as well
   as (3) 3-D numerical groundwater flow and heat transport modeling and
   scenario development. The combination of these methods allows for the
   quantifying of the thermal influences on the investigated urban
   groundwater body, including the influences of thermal groundwater use
   and heated subsurface constructions. Subsequently, first implications
   for management strategies are discussed, including minimizing further
   groundwater temperature increase, targeting ``potential natural{''}
   groundwater temperatures for specific aquifer regions and exploiting the
   thermal potential.},

Abstract = {Marine reserves have both conservation and fishery benefits.
   Nevertheless, there are no general criteria about when and where to
   establish new reserves, how to evaluate their efficacy, and how to
   conduct adaptive management to achieve conservation goals. We applied a
   decision-theory framework to optimally allocate conservation resources
   between improving data on population status and establishing a reserve
   for species conservation. Our goal was to maximize reserve benefits
   given the constraints of a population growth rate that would permit
   sustainability of resources. We illustrate our decision framework with a
   retrospective analysis of a 7-year time series on abundance of the
   leopard grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea) in the Sea of Cortes, Mexico. We
   used the lower bound of the distribution of the population growth rate
   (lambda) as a decision rule for determining how many years of monitoring
   are needed to detect reserve effects. We determined the minimum time
   frame needed to estimate lambda based on a stated level of risk
   tolerance for four sites. As expected, the coefficient of variation for
   the lambda declined with the number of years of data. This increased
   precision with additional years of data resulted from the high degree of
   annual variability in the system. Where populations were slow to respond
   to reserves, more data were needed to detect a positive lambda value.
   For the leopard grouper case study, confidence in the estimate of lambda
   increased with the number of years of data. Our decision framework may
   be used to identify the minimum number of years of data needed before a
   management decision about reserve establishment could be made that is
   reasonably likely to meet its management objectives.},

Title = {Ten Thousand Voices on Marine Climate Change in Europe: Different
   Perceptions among Demographic Groups and Nationalities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Over the past few decades, substantial funding has been directed toward
   improving scientific understanding and management of impacts of climate
   change in the marine environment. Following concerns that the key
   messages from these studies were not reaching the public, a
   comprehensive opinion poll of 10,000 European citizens in 10 countries
   was conducted to establish levels of awareness, concern, and trust among
   different demographic groups (by age, gender, proximity to the coast)
   and nationalities. Citizens exhibited varying levels of self-declared
   ``informedness{''} and concern. Citizens from Germany, Italy and Spain
   claimed to be the most informed on marine climate change issues; those
   from Czech Republic, Netherlands and Estonia claimed to be least
   informed. Respondents were least aware of ocean acidification and most
   aware of melting sea ice, pollution and overfishing. Citizens of Italy
   suggested that they were generally most concerned about marine climate
   change issues. Respondents from coastal areas claimed to be both more
   informed and more concerned than those living inland, as did females and
   older age groups (54-64 years). European citizens obtain information
   about climate change in the seas and ocean from different sources,
   particularly television and the internet. Trust in the various media
   sources varies among countries and demographic groups. Television is
   trusted most in Estonia, Germany and Ireland and least in France. The
   internet is trusted most in Italy, Czech Republic and Estonia, but least
   in France and the United Kingdom. 18-24 year olds are the biggest users
   of the internet, but trust this source less than older age groups.
   Academic scientists or those working for environmental NGOs are trusted
   more than scientists working for government or industry. Citizens from
   France are more trusting of industry than any other country polled. In
   terms of policy actions, most respondents highlighted mitigation
   measures as opposed to local-scale adaptation. Younger participants
   prioritized actions associated with reducing carbon emissions, whereas
   older age groups prioritized improving coastal defenses. Successful
   adaptation to the impacts of climate change requires public engagement
   and support for policy decisions, and the use of different approaches to
   take account of differences among demographic groups and nationalities.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at drawing attention to the deficiencies of urban heat
   island (UHI) mitigation strategies and urban climate maps (UCMs) towards
   practical implementations and efficient interventions in urban
   development policies and action plans (UDP/AP). The paper critically
   reviews the knowledge of the UHI and UCMs to identify the major
   shortcomings in the production of action plans. The shortcomings are
   identified in three aspects including (1) active involvement in UDP/AP
   (2) urban managerial and governmental actions, and (3) public engagement
   and participation. More specifically, it is first discussed that the
   current synthesizing paradigm of UCMs and UHI studies only considers the
   physical aspects of the problem/solution. Second, climate
   recommendations have paid a little attention to the imperative role,
   capacities and motivations of urban governance and managerial
   organizations. Third, mitigation strategies have been proposed without
   considering public needs and willingness. To overcome these challenges,
   a collaborative platform of UCM systems should be developed through a
   holistic approach. Such platform should provide a ground for efficient
   interventions in UDP/AP as well as interactions of all actors and
   indicators. To this end, the technical challenges of the UHI studies and
   UCM systems to link with UDP/AP are discussed. Second, UCMs should
   explicitly define the role of urban climate governance, prioritize the
   actions and state the policy agendas with regard to local government
   capacities and motivational elements. Finally, local communities' needs'
   and stockholders' opinions should be involved in the synthesizing
   process. As a potential solution, need-base approaches and weighing
   systems should be further developed to consider all urban actors'
   perspectives. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Correlation of Haematological and Biochemical Adaptations with Mode of

Abstract = {In the Southern Ocean the suborder Notothenioidei is dominant. Most
   notothenioids are benthic and sedentary; we have studied haemoglobin
   structure/function in search of correlations with mode of life and
   evolution.
   In the Antarctic shelf Pleuragramma antarctica (0-900 m) is dominant in
   abundance and biomass. It has circum-Antarctic distribution, and is the
   only fully pelagic notothenioid. Being the best example of notothenioid
   adaptation to pelagic habitats, P. antarctica calls for studies on
   adaptive strategies.
   In notothenioids, evolution has developed blood adaptations, such as
   reduction of erythrocyte number and haemoglobin
   concentration/multiplicity, reaching the extreme of eliminating
   haemoglobin in Channichthyidae. Species of the red-blooded families
   generally only have one haemoglobin (95-99\% of the total). In contrast,
   P. antarctica has three major haemoglobins. As this species performs
   seasonal migrations through water masses that may have different and
   fluctuating temperatures, during evolution it developed adaptations
   suitable to allow optimal energy savings during the
   oxygenation-deoxygenation cycle, producing haemoglobins displaying wide
   differences in thermodynamic behaviour. The expression of multiple
   genes, typical of juveniles, remains high also in the adult stage. This
   oxygen-transport system is remarkably unique and appears designed to fit
   an unusual mode of life through refined adaptation strategies.
   In the phylogenetic trees, the alpha(a) chain of P. antarctica
   haemoglobins falls into the clade of major Antarctic haemoglobins; the
   same applies to the beta(a) chains. The ab chain is in a basal position
   with respect to the clade of Antarctic minor Hbs; the same applies to
   the beta(b) chain. All this appears congruent with the phylogenetic
   evidence.
   Population dynamics and ecophysiological adaptations of P. antarctica
   are worth investigating to identify strategies of resilience to current
   climate changes.},

Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-74},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {The unprecedented global heatwave of 2014-2017 was a defining event for
   many ecosystems. Widespread degradation caused by coral bleaching, for
   example, highlighted the vulnerability of hundreds of millions of people
   dependent on reefs for their livelihoods, well-being, and food security.
   Scientists and policy makers are now reassessing long-held assumptions
   about coping with anthropogenic climate change, particularly the
   assumption that strong local institutions can maintain ecological and
   social resilience through ecosystem-based management, adaptation, and
   restoration. Governance is struggling to address the new normal as
   ecosystem assemblages transform to novel configurations. A central
   challenge for policy makers in the Anthropocene is navigating
   environmental crises and coping with societal insecurity and change.
   Ecosystem governance needs a new paradigm to embrace rapid change and
   shape future trajectories. In this Perspective, we focus on coral reefs
   as vanguards for governance transformation. We explain the spatial,
   temporal, and political dynamics of reefs as they respond to climate
   change and outline a new governance paradigm applicable to all
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {This chapter aims to identify some of the drought and groundwater
   quality issues from the perspective of coastal area. Coastal area is
   among the prime focus of delicate hydrological cycle susceptible during
   extreme climatic condition (including drought). The impacts of drought
   on water availability and groundwater quality in the coastal area will
   affect many sectors, including energy production, infrastructure, human
   health, agriculture, and ecosystems. The quality of coastal beaches and
   other water bodies that are used for swimming, fishing, and other
   recreational activities can be affected by changes in precipitation,
   increases in temperature, and sea level rise. Changes in the
   availability and quality of groundwater are also major concerns for
   countries where water resources are already stressed along the coastal
   area. Countries will confront the challenge of a changing groundwater
   quality. They will likely adopt a variety of adaptation practices,
   designed to better conserve our groundwater supplies and develop
   alternative strategies for coastal area groundwater management.},

Title = {A fuzzy analytic network process model to mitigate the risks associated

Abstract = {In the offshore renewable energy industry, it is extremely important to
   reduce the likelihood as well as the magnitude of potential risk events
   during system's actual operation. Operational risks (either risk of
   system failures or environmental risks) may cause catastrophic damages
   to personnel or infrastructure and result in substantial costs in terms
   of lost production and emergency maintenance operations. Selection of a
   suitable strategy for mitigation of the risks associated with offshore
   renewable energy projects is a very complex and critical task. The aim
   of this paper is to propose a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP)
   approach, based on Chang's extent analysis, in order to select the
   ``most appropriate risk mitigation strategy{''} for offshore wind farms.
   Our proposed model consists of four possible alternatives (variation of
   offshore site layout, improvement of maintenance services, upgrading the
   monitoring systems, and modification in design of wind turbines) among
   which the decision maker has to select the best strategy according to
   four comparison criteria: safety, added value, cost and feasibility. The
   model is then applied to determine a suitable risk mitigation strategy
   for an offshore wind farm consisting of 30 wind turbines of 2 MW.
   Finally, the results are compared with those obtained using the crisp
   AHP and ANP models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The ocean plays a central role in climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. However, climate and ocean policies have been historically
   siloed. After decades of slow convergence, the Ocean and Climate Change
   Dialogue, decided at COP25 and launched online in December 2020, was the
   first forum for Parties and non-Party stakeholders to the UNFCCC to give
   their perspectives on how the climate regime should address
   ocean-related mitigation and adaptation. The Ocean Dialogue was informed
   by 47 prior open submissions provided by a broad swath of actors from
   across the UN system and from civil society, including traditional and
   youth voices. Our analysis of the submissions demonstrates a political
   evolution towards the nexus among climate, ocean, and biodiversity
   regimes. The submissions uniformly acknowledge that ocean and climate
   systems are inextricably linked, and that consideration of ocean-based
   action will strengthen climate action and vice versa. Salient themes of
   the submissions include changing ocean impacts, carbon sinks and blue
   carbon opportunities, and the need for ecosystem resilience,
   biodiversity management and improved understanding of normative and
   institutional frameworks. There is a strong call to recognize the
   interconnectedness of the biophysical world. Similar themes emerged
   during the actual Ocean Dialogue and the subsequent informal meeting on
   next steps. The main message conveyed is the dire necessity to implement
   strong stewardship and good governance of the blue planet in a disrupted
   climate using cooperative and concrete actions. This analysis highlights
   the need for a continued transdisciplinary international dialogue on the
   ocean and climate change which elevates the ocean-climate-biodiversity
   nexus via collaborative science, finance, and policy. Key policy
   insights Ocean and marine ecosystem impacts of climate change were
   widely acknowledged, and referenced by ninety-one percent of
   submissions. After decades of slow integration of ocean into climate
   policy, the Ocean Dialogue submissions acknowledge that climate policy
   must address linkages with the ocean and its biodiversity. Concerns
   include changing ocean impacts, carbon sinks and blue carbon
   opportunities, and the need for ecosystem resilience, biodiversity
   management and increased institutional interactions. Continuation of
   this Dialogue, with strengthened collaboration between States and
   non-state actors, may give rise to multilateral and multilevel
   decision-making toward sustainable climate, ocean and biodiversity
   action.},

Abstract = {High temperatures and heatwaves can cause large societal impacts by
   increasing health risks, mortality rates, and personal discomfort. These
   impacts are exacerbated in cities because of the Urban Heat Island (UHI)
   effect, and the high and increasing concentrations of people, assets and
   economic activities. Risks from high temperatures are now widely
   recognised but motivation and implementation of proportionate policy
   responses is inhibited by inadequate quantification of the benefits of
   adaptation options, and associated uncertainties. This study utilises
   high spatial resolution probabilistic projections of urban temperatures
   along with projections of demographic change, to provide a probabilistic
   risk assessment of heat impacts on urban society. The study focuses on
   Greater London and the surrounding region, assessing mortality risk,
   thermal discomfort in residential buildings, and adaptation options
   within an integrated framework. Climate change is projected to increase
   future heat-related mortality and residential discomfort. However,
   adjusting the temperature response function by 1-2 A degrees C, to
   simulate adaptation and acclimatisation, reduced annual heat related
   mortality by 32-69 \% across the scenarios tested, relative to a no
   adaptation scenario. Similar benefits of adaptation were seen for
   residential discomfort. The study also highlights additional benefits in
   terms of reduced mortality and residential discomfort that mitigating
   the urban heat island, by reducing albedo and anthropogenic heat
   emissions, could have.},

Abstract = {Climate change is projected to redistribute fisheries resources,
   resulting in tropical regions suffering decreases in seafood production.
   While sustainably managing marine ecosystems contributes to building
   climate resilience, these solutions require transformation of ocean
   governance. Recent studies and international initiatives suggest that
   conserving high seas biodiversity and fish stocks will have ecological
   and economic benefits; however, implications for seafood security under
   climate change have not been examined. Here, we apply global-scale
   mechanistic species distribution models to 30 major straddling fish
   stocks to show that transforming high seas fisheries governance could
   increase resilience to climate change impacts. By closing the high seas
   to fishing or cooperatively managing its fisheries, we project that
   catches in exclusive economic zones (EEZs) would likely increase by
   around 10\% by 2050 relative to 2000 under climate change
   (representative concentration pathway 4.5 and 8.5), compensating for the
   expected losses (around -6\%) from `business-as-usual'. Specifically,
   high seas closure increases the resilience of fish stocks, as indicated
   by a mean species abundance index, by 30\% in EEZs. We suggest that
   improving high seas fisheries governance would increase the resilience
   of coastal countries to climate change.},

Abstract = {Due to changes in atmospheric circulation and warmer winters, the
   frequency of strong westerly storms associated with high sea level in
   ice-free sea conditions has increased over the last half-century on the
   western coast of Estonia including in Parnu City. During the last 50
   years Parnu has suffered from two remarkably high storm surges and
   associated inundations in 1967 (2.53 m above mean sea level) and in 2005
   (2.75 m). This paper addresses the problem of coastal floods in Parnu,
   analyzing different action plans in order to protect the city against
   floods, which may get even more disastrous due to climate change induced
   sea level rise. Our analysis showed that application of adaptation
   measures seems to be the most reasonable option for Parnu, while the
   expenses on building a protective dam exceeds the potentially avoidable
   losses. A managed retreat was not acceptable either because the city
   would lose its identity as a famous summer resort with excellent sandy
   beaches. Dissipation of storm surge water over adjacent low-lying
   uninhabited territories would not give any clear effect reducing the
   high water level only by 5 centimetres as maximum. In case of adapting
   to temporary extensive floods, a more efficient warning system and
   better communication between the authorities and the local people are
   needed.},

Abstract = {Climate change within the urban contexts is a crisis that cities are
   confronting globally. This issue poses numerous negative consequences
   such as thermal discomfort and increased energy usage within the
   building sector. This is especially the case in Western Sydney,
   Australia, where the average maximum temperature has risen by 7-8
   degrees C within the past 30 years. This increase in temperature is
   highly concerning, since this region is witnessing rapid urban and
   infrastructural development and is proposed as the third-largest economy
   of Australia. Temperature changes in this region will also result in
   considerably increasing the electricity used for cooling purposes. This
   paper presents a parametric approach driven multi-objective optimization
   methodology to discover optimum design solution based on the urban
   microclimate and cooling energy demand of multi-functional buildings
   within this urban context. Mitigation measures including a range of
   design factors at both building (typology and window to wall ratio) and
   urban scales (aspect ratio and urban grid rotation) are further
   suggested for developing context sensitive optimum urban layouts. The
   resultant solutions indicate an improvement in urban thermal comfort,
   cooling and heating energy use by up to 25.85\%, 72.76\%, and 93.67\%,
   respectively. (C) 2022 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

Abstract = {Linkages of urban and industrial cooling with sustainable development
   goals and climate change perspectives are well ac-knowledged, mainly for
   developing economies in tropical climates. Angul-Talcher region is one
   of the oldest industrial clusters of India, and the region experiences
   higher atmospheric heat island intensities with magnitudes of 7 to 9
   degrees C attrib-uted to the Industrial Heat Island (IHI) effect. In the
   present study, various measures for mitigating heat island effect in the
   region and assessed their impact using an Improved Weather Research and
   Forecasting model coupled with the Single -Layer Urban Canopy Model. The
   improved framework includes the release of industrial emissions at stack
   height and sector-wise diurnal profiles of anthropogenic heat (AH)
   released from vehicles, residential, and industry/power. The mit-igation
   measures comprised strategies like alteration in building materials and
   conversion of landuse-landcover (LULC) of selected grid cells in the
   model domain to more vegetation or water bodies. It was noted that the
   cool roofs and walls to-gether reduced IHIs by 0.5 degrees C, while
   green roofs and cool pavements achieved a reduction of 0.3 degrees C and
   0.1 degrees C, respectively. The introduction of water bodies showed
   maximum reduction in IHIs by 3 to 5 degrees C during daytime and 1 to 2
   degrees C over mining and industrial stations. During night-time,
   conversion to mixed forests was more effective (Delta T approximate to 1
   degrees C) than conversion to water bodies. A combination of cool roofs
   with the introduction of water bodies in the mining areas and mixed
   forest patches in industry stations was found to be the most effective
   mitigation strategy for mitigating the industrial heat island effect
   over the Angul-Talcher region. These mitigation scenarios can/should
   serve as a theoretical reference for imple-menting actual mitigation
   measures, which would require consideration of economic, social, and
   policy aspects apart from scientific ones for practical application.},

Abstract = {On both local and global scales, the expectation of climate
   change-related adverse impacts and changing human vulnerabilities
   presents a novel challenge for the public health sector's adaptation.
   Our aim is to present ``transfrontier{''} eLearning as one of the
   effective case-and place-specific options towards adapting to climate
   change repercussions.
   Human societies and nature have always adjusted to climate variability
   and extreme weather events, but climate change is moving climate
   conditions outside the range of past human experiences. Although climate
   change will create advantages for some regions and subpopulations, it
   will adversely affect ecosystems, water resources, energy,
   transportation, population health, public security, and other sectors.
   Like other parts of the world, the province of Quebec (Canada) has not
   been spared by negative impacts related to these recent climate change
   conditions. For Quebecer public health professionals, climate change is
   a significant threat in learning to adapt to its negative effects on
   human health. These range from the direct effects of average warming and
   urban heat islands, ozone air pollution, wildfires, summer/winter
   storms, and UV exposures to the indirect effects resulting from changes
   in water supply or in vector-borne diseases. In particular, climate
   change affects mental and physical health trough modifications in the
   frequency, intensity and duration of extreme meteorological events.
   While the frequency of extreme cold events is expected to decrease, heat
   waves are increasing. Depending on the effectiveness and extent of
   adaptation options, heat-related morbidity and mortality could increase
   over coming decades. Another set of major impacts is related to warmer
   air temperatures and higher atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations,
   increasing pollen production and lengthening the pollen season.
   Faced with such major and varied effects, preparedness is crucial in
   (mental) public health. Two key messages are here highlighted: (1) a
   ``transfrontier{''} vision of eEcoLearning and knowledge
   transfer/translation is needed. We cannot satisfy ourselves with
   sectorial approaches in helping societies to adapt to climate change
   because of the complex interactions between these climatic changes and
   non-climatic factors such as demographics, economics, land use, and
   technology; (2) a sustained effort to educate actors from various
   sectors (health professionals and decision-makers; the public sector;
   the private sector; non-governmental organizations) and to inform the
   adult population, especially the younger generations, is crucial to
   promote a behavioural change.},

Abstract = {For efficient progress, model properties and measurement needs can adapt
   to oceanic events and interactions as they occur. The combination of
   models and data via data assimilation can also be adaptive. These
   adaptive concepts are discussed and exemplified within the context of
   comprehensive real-time ocean observing and prediction systems. Novel
   adaptive modeling approaches based on simplified maximum likelihood
   principles are developed and applied to physical and
   physical-biogeochemical dynamics. In the regional examples shown, they
   allow the joint calibration of parameter values and model structures.
   Adaptable components of the Error Subspace Statistical Estimation (ESSE)
   system are reviewed and illustrated. Results indicate that error
   estimates, ensemble sizes, error subspace ranks, covariance tapering
   parameters and stochastic error models can be calibrated by such
   quantitative adaptation. New adaptive sampling approaches and schemes
   are outlined. Illustrations suggest that these adaptive schemes can be
   used in real time with the potential for most efficient sampling. (c)

Abstract = {Because of the complexity and speed of environmental, climatic, and
   socio-political change in coastal marine social-ecological systems,
   there is significant academic and applied interest in assessing and
   fostering the adaptive capacity of coastal communities. Adaptive
   capacity refers to the latent ability of a system to respond proactively
   and positively to stressors or opportunities. A variety of qualitative,
   quantitative, and participatory approaches have been developed and
   applied to understand and assess adaptive capacity, each with different
   benefits, drawbacks, insights, and implications. Drawing on case studies
   of coastal communities from around the globe, we describe and compare 11
   approaches that are often used to study adaptive capacity of social and
   ecological systems in the face of social, environmental, and climatic
   change. We synthesize lessons from a series of case studies to present
   important considerations to frame research and to choose an assessment
   approach, key challenges to analyze adaptive capacity in linked
   social-ecological systems, and good practices to link results to action
   to foster adaptive capacity. We suggest that more attention be given to
   integrated social-ecological assessments and that greater effort be
   placed on evaluation and monitoring of adaptive capacity over time and
   across scales. Overall, although sustainability science holds a promise
   of providing solutions to real world problems, we found that too few
   assessments seem to lead to tangible outcomes or actions to foster
   adaptive capacity in social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {While effective in mitigating the effects of hazards, Australia's State
   and local jurisdictions have been reluctant to endorse the removal of
   people and structures from hazard-prone coastal land, known as ``managed
   retreat{''}, as a climate change adaptation policy. Its implementation
   represents a significant intrusion into private property interests,
   which is further complicated by the uncertainty surrounding future
   sea-level rise and the timing of coastal hazards. This article reviews
   the body of legal scholarship on managed retreat. It provides a general
   overview of the prevailing themes, before examining the extent the
   literature informs policy design matters, with a focus on how the law
   can affect retreat; when removal from vulnerable land should occur; and
   criteria for constructing a policy response. The article concludes by
   recommending future research directions for advancing managed retreat as
   public policy.},

Abstract = {Quantitative vulnerability modeling provides local decision makers and
   planners with tangible scores that they can utilize to develop and
   implement effective mitigation strategies. Considering appropriate scale
   and quantitative methods in vulnerability assessments can help decision
   makers develop hazard mitigation policies that are effective at the
   jurisdictional level at which they are implemented. Several types of
   statistical approaches such as principal component analysis, classical
   regression and simultaneous autoregressive models have been used to
   measure vulnerability at various scales (e.g. state or county), but
   these approaches have limitations for measuring sub-county
   vulnerability. This paper discusses existing statistical methods
   utilized in vulnerability assessments and presents a hierarchical
   generalized linear regression model (Hierarchical GLM) with multiscalar
   indicators and spatial components. Our model results illustrate that
   certain indicators are spatially and scalar dependent, providing
   evidence that examining vulnerability at a sub-county scale while also
   maintaining a multiscalar perspective offers additional information
   about social-environmental vulnerability than provided by typical
   approaches.},

Title = {Local perceptions of climate change impacts and migration patterns in
   Male, Maldives},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {183},
Number = {4},
Pages = {370-385},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {For the last few decades, Maldives has been seen as being at the
   forefront of addressing climate change impacts. The low elevation of the
   islands makes them vulnerable to slow-onset hazards, such as coastal
   erosion, sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, and change in monsoon
   patterns and hence rainfall. Consequently, migration has long been
   discussed as an adaptation strategy for the population. This study
   covers outcomes from our field research conducted among islanders in
   Male, the capital of Maldives, in 2013. It contributes empirical
   evidence toward understanding complex relations among environmental
   challenges, climate change, and migration. We set up two main research
   questions. The first question explored islanders' perceptions of impacts
   of climatic variability in recent years and possible impacts of future
   climate change. The second question probed whether out-migration from
   the islands might be considered to be an adaptation strategy and whether
   the islanders were willing to move outside Maldives due to projected
   climate change impacts. We conducted our field research in the capital
   Male and nearby residential islands, using quantitative questionnaires
   with local respondents (N=347). Our results suggest that, besides a set
   of actually experienced environmental and climate challenges, slow-onset
   climate change impacts such as sea-level rise are perceived as being one
   of the key factors affecting Maldivian society and livelihoods. More
   than 50\% of respondents perceive future sea-level rise to be a serious
   challenge at the national level and they accept that migration from
   islands to other countries might be a potential option. Conversely, from
   the individual perspective, sea-level rise is not perceived by the local
   population as being one of their own important challenges. The reason is
   that many other factors - cultural, religious, economic and social -
   play an important role in decisionmaking about migrating or not.},

Title = {Recent advances in black box and white-box models for urban heat island
   prediction: Implications of fusing the two methods},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {165},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is a serious concern for urban
   planners and policymakers, requiring effective and efficient mitigation
   policies. To develop such policies, accurate and pre-emptive estimations
   of current and future UHI manifestations are vital elements that help
   determine efficient policies and mitigation techniques. There are two
   fundamental approaches for modelling overheating in an urban
   environment: whitebox and black-box based methods. The first one is
   characterized by the easily interpretable working process, while the
   unclear working procedure defines the second one. The present study
   comprehensively reviews the commonly used white-box and black-box based
   approaches applied for UHI predictions, analyses the existing literature
   adopting these tools for UHI prediction, and discusses the effectiveness
   of fusing both methods at the design and operation stages of the urban
   area for effective prediction and mitigation of UHI effect. The
   literature analysis showed that the transparent working process and high
   prediction accuracy of the physical-based whitebox models make them a
   popular and reliable tool for UHI evaluation. Nevertheless, some
   white-box based simulation tools are too complex and require a high
   level of expertise to operate, leading to potential inaccuracies in the
   obtained outcomes. Black-box models, in turn, despite their opaque
   working process, are more straightforward in use and require less
   computation time. The fusion of these two methods is a novel approach
   that may benefit both UHI prediction and mitigation at the design and
   operation stages, respectively.},

Title = {Role of green roofs in reducing heat stress in vulnerable urban
   communities-a multidisciplinary approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Green infrastructure, such as green roofs, is increasingly being used to
   reduce `heat stresses' associated with urban heat island effects. This
   article discusses strategies to identify vulnerable neighborhoods in the
   City of Chicago, where green roofs could achieve multiple goals to
   mitigate urban heat-related challenges. Numerical simulations were
   performed using the urbanized version of the Advanced Research Weather
   Research and Forecasting model to predict rooftop temperatures, a
   representative variable for exposure in this study. The model was
   dynamically coupled with a physically-based green rooftop algorithm as a
   part of the urban parameterization within the model. Our approach
   integrates information from multiple sources: social vulnerability
   indices (a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity),
   high-resolution temperature simulations over the urban area, and
   observed electricity (air conditioning) consumption data. The social
   vulnerability indicators were used to develop a quantitative heat
   vulnerability index for Chicago. We found that an analysis of multiple
   drivers is needed to identify neighborhoods that will likely benefit
   from mitigation strategies like green roofs. Our case study identified a
   large number of census tracts in south and west Chicago, along with
   isolated tracts throughout the city that would strongly benefit from
   green roof implementation. The tools and methodology from this study can
   be easily adopted for other urban regions and would be informative for
   stakeholders and managers, in general, in making adaptation strategies
   for extreme heat management.},

Title = {Evaluating recovery strategies for the disruptions in liner shipping

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {389-409},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Purpose Since the start of the current century, the world at large has
   experienced uncertainties as a result of climate change, terrorism
   threats and increasing economic upheaval. These uncertainties create
   non-classical risks for global seaborne container trade and liner
   shipping networks (LSNs). The purpose of this paper is to establish a
   novel risk-based resilience framework to measure the effectiveness of
   different recovery strategies for the disruptions in LSNs in a
   quantitative manner. Design/methodology/approach Based on a resilience
   loss triangle model, an indicator of resilience-cost ratio is designed
   to measure the performance of LSNs during recovery. Four recovery
   strategies are proposed to test the rationality and feasibility of the
   developed indicator in aiding decision-making of LSNs from a resilience
   perspective. Findings The analysis results reveal that the superiorities
   of different recovery strategies vary depending on both the structures
   of LSNs and the specific requirements during recovery. Moreover,
   optimizing the sequence of ports being recovered will improve the
   overall recovery efficiency of the investigated LSN. Research
   limitations/implications As an exploratory research trying to enrich the
   risk-based resilience evaluation of LSNs from a complex network
   perspective, only two attributes (e.g. port scare and economy) are
   considered at the current stage when estimating the time needed to fully
   recover the whole LSN. In future research, more attributes from the
   industry may be identified and incorporated into the proposed model to
   further extend its ability and application scopes. Practical
   implications The findings will help to improve managerial understandings
   of recovery strategies to build more resilient LSNs. The proposed model
   has the capability to be tailored to tackle different types of risks in
   addition to the storm disaster condition. Originality/value The
   risk-based resilience framework and the resilience-cost ratio indicator
   are newly developed in this research. They can consider LSNs' structural
   resilience and the total costs that a recovery strategy needs to restore
   the whole system simultaneously.},

Title = {Local solutions to manage the effects of global climate change on a
   marine ecosystem: a process guide for marine resource managers},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {66},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The marine environment plays an important role in controlling the amount
   of CO(2) that remains within the earth's atmosphere, but it has not
   received as much attention as the terrestrial environment regarding
   climate-change effects, mitigation programmes, and action plans.
   Potential physical effects of climate change within the marine
   environment, including ocean acidification, changes in winds that drive
   upwelling and ocean circulation patterns, increasing global sea surface
   temperatures, and sea level rise, can result in dramatic changes within
   marine and coastal ecosystems. Often, marine resource managers feel
   overwhelmed by the magnitude of this issue and are therefore uncertain
   how to begin to take action. It may seem that they do not have the time,
   funding, or staff to take on a challenge as large as climate change, and
   fail to act as a result. Using NOAA's Gulf of the Farallones National
   Marine Sanctuary as a case study, this paper outlines the need to act
   now and presents an easy-to-use process guide, providing managers
   options to incorporate effectively the influences of climate change into
   management strategies, as well as mitigate these influences through
   community outreach and a reduction in workplace emissions.},

Abstract = {The study assessed the impacts of an adjusted cropping calendar on the
   welfare of rice farming households in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) of
   Vietnam in the 2019/20 Winter- Spring (W-S) crop season. Some farmers in
   the study area practiced early planting as an adaptation strategy to
   avoid the risk of saline intrusion during the 2019-2020 El Nino. The
   study randomly surveyed 1,176 rice farmers in three MRD provinces,
   namely, Long An, Kien Giang, and Soc Trang, of which 412 were early
   planters and 764 were non early planters. Propensity score matching was
   applied to explore the effects of early planting on the rice yield and
   rice farming income. Early planting during the 2019/20 W-S season
   produced (i) an increase in rice farming income of VND 22.8-24.6 million
   per farmer or VND 8.62-8.77 million per hectare; (ii) an increase in the
   annual rice farming income of VND 13.7-17.1 million per farmer or VND
   3.2-4.3 million per hectare; and (iii) an increase in rice yield by
   5.29-5.67 tons per farmer or 2.51-2.59 tons per hectare. The findings
   confirm that adjusting the rice cropping calendar as an adaptation
   strategy against salinity can improve rice farmers' production and
   income. (c) 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by

Abstract = {Climate change is having and will have drastic consequences for high
   density populated areas such as cities. There is thus a need to develop
   more tools to evaluate new strategies for adaptation to and mitigation
   of changing temperatures. Additional functionalities were integrated in
   the urban energy modelling tool CitySim to include an evapotranspiration
   process and to integrate low rise vegetation as well as trees. In the
   process, the Canopy Interface Model (CIM) - previously coupled with
   CitySim - was further developed to integrate the evapotranspiration
   process and to analyse its impact on the local microclimate.
   Tvapotranspiration as well as the surface temperature are computed in
   CitySim and the values are then used as boundary conditions in CIM to
   calculate the vertical profiles of wind speed, temperature and humidity.
   Using the campus of the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland as a case study,
   it was demonstrated that the ground evaporative cooling can be an
   effective mitigation measure for decreasing locally the urban heat
   island intensity. In future studies, other strategies such as reflective
   asphalt, will be combined with the evaporative cooling strategies, to
   determine the most effective action measures that could be easily
   implemented.},

Abstract = {Endangered woundfin Plagopterus argentissimus embryos and larvae were
   exposed to artificial ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation to directly examine
   the effects on mortality. The experiment was part of a project assisting
   the Virgin River Resource Management and Recovery Program's efforts to
   increase hatchery production of this endangered fish. The UV-B radiation
   used in this experiment was administered in treatments of 0.060, 0.030,
   and 0.015 mW/cm(2) to simulate 100, 50, and 25\% of the ambient
   irradiance levels documented in outdoor tanks and living streams at
   Bubbling Ponds State Fish Hatchery, in Arizona. Embryos and larvae were
   exposed for 14.5 h followed by 9.5 h of darkness, in correspondence with
   the daylight hours at Bubbling Ponds. No embryos survived UV-B
   treatments; mortality among control (UV-B-free) treatments varied
   (5-100\%) among females, indicating that there may be important parental
   effects that influence embryo mortality. Larval mortality was also 100\%
   for individuals exposed to any of the three UV-B treatments. In contrast
   to embryo trials, larval mortality in UV-B-free treatments approached
   20\% for 2-d-old larvae. These experiments provide evidence that
   woundfin embryos and larvae are sensitive to even low levels of UV-B
   when exposed for 14.5 h. Susceptibility of larvae to UV-B also appears
   to be a function of age at exposure, with older larvae exhibiting
   significantly lower levels of mortality during the initial days of
   exposure. Experiments with UV-B mitigation strategies indicated that
   shade cloth, Aquashade (R), and elevated dissolved organic carbon can
   aid in the attenuation of UV-B, and these strategies may assist hatchery
   managers in implementing UV-B mitigation measures during periods when
   woundfin are most susceptible.},

Abstract = {The paper carried out a comparative assessment of coastal hazards and
   their resultant impacts on communities and physical systems/resources in
   the countries located in the Asian coastal regions and maritime areas.
   Only those natural hazards were considered in the assessment which
   pawned from climate change-induced phenomena. At the outset, the coastal
   countries including Bangladesh are grouped into three categories based
   on their exposure to natural hazards, the degree of vulnerability of the
   communities, socio-economic contexts and technological advancements to
   cope with the challenges. Then the state, nature, pattern of coastal
   hazards, and their resultant consequences have been analyzed. Secondary
   research materials, especially the National Communication (NC) reports
   of the countries submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change (UNFCCC) were used to undertake the study. The results
   suggest that the pattern of impacts and their consequences are somewhere
   identical and, in many areas, different that suggest cross-country
   understanding combined with local knowledge is crucial for taking
   effective policies for adaptation or mitigation planning in respective
   countries.},

Title = {Governing urban climate change adaptation in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {413-427},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is a growing, although still far from comprehensive, literature
   within China on the impacts of climate change in urban areas; also an
   evolving policy framework at national level to address these concerns
   and an increased interest in climate change adaptation from many local
   governments. This paper summarizes the urban risks and vulnerabilities
   highlighted by the literature, and reviews central and local government
   responses. It then assesses policy response, including how this
   considers vulnerability and future risks, formulates an adaptation
   strategy, engages stakeholders and assesses adaptive capacity. This
   shows how the Chinese system limits the influence on climate change
   adaptation of residents and small businesses, and of social scientists.
   The reasons for this include the tendency to use climate change as an
   economic growth engine (and GDP growth remains the most important factor
   for assessing local government officials' performance), little provision
   for participation in policy-making, and weak post-implementation
   evaluation once a policy has been scaled up at national level. These
   have affected the quality of evidence-based policy-making and make it
   difficult to draw lessons from unsuccessful practice.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems are employed to effectively protect people and communities in
   coastal areas from tropical cyclone (TC) hazards. Although a spatially
   explicit TC hazard mitigation service (TCHMS) is essential for devising
   adaptation strategy and resilience policy, the process and delivery of
   this program are unclear. We improved a capacity-exposure-demand
   conceptual framework using Guangdong Province, China, as a case study
   area, and spatial analysis was employed to assess the ecosystem service.
   Under this framework, we assessed ``capacity{''} as the natural
   potential protection against TC hazards, ``exposure{''} as the need for
   services, and ``demand{''} as the estimated necessity of protecting
   coastal populations and economic interests. The analysis results were
   then used to map the TCHMS flow and benefit gap. The results showed that
   21.6\% of the whole province had low capacity, 25.3\% had high exposure,
   and 19.3\% had high demand. A significantly negative correlation was
   present between the TCHMS capacity and exposure, and a positive
   correlation was shown between the exposure and demand. In particular,
   the TCHMS flow and benefit were sufficient in inland areas but were
   severely deficient in coastal megacities. In Guangdong Province, the
   Pearl River Delta, and Chaoshan (CS), 3.3\%, 4.0\%, and 15.3\% of the
   areas showed high demand-low capacity-high exposure patterns,
   respectively. Our findings will deepen the scientific understanding of
   the degree of protection a given ecosystem will provide to communities
   and infrastructures exposed to TC hazards and will thus provide
   scientific support for coastal ecosystem planning and management.},

Abstract = {To minimize the impacts of climate change on human wellbeing,
   governments, development agencies, and civil society organizations have
   made substantial investments in improving people's capacity to adapt to
   change. Yet to date, these investments have tended to focus on a very
   narrow understanding of adaptive capacity. Here, we propose an approach
   to build adaptive capacity across five domains: the assets that people
   can draw upon in times of need; the flexibility to change strategies;
   the ability to organize and act collectively; learning to recognize and
   respond to change; and the agency to determine whether to change or not.},

Title = {Preparations for climate change's influences on cultural heritage},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {386-401},
Abstract = {Purpose - In Norway the most critical effects of climate change are
   predicted to be increased rain and snow, higher temperatures, increased
   wind loads, and sea-level rise. This will increase the number of floods
   and landslides, along with more cycles around the freezing point and
   increased exposure to high moisture. The main issue for protecting
   Norway's historical monuments from climate change is how to be aware of
   and how to handle the coming problems. One challenge is to define and
   give this information to heritage owners and local authorities. The
   purpose of this paper is to describe some of the practical threats
   related to climate change, and provide suggestions for mitigation and
   adaption strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical information of the problem is
   useful at a general level, but the practical impact has to be used at a
   local level. Improved knowledge about the risks for deterioration at
   different exposure levels, thorough surveys, and practical solutions,
   can significantly reduce the negative effects. This knowledge must reach
   the people that have local and daily contact with the cultural heritage.
   Information to the owners and responsible authorities about the normal
   risk of deterioration and how to identify risks related to climate
   change is crucial.
   Findings - The main results of the authors' work is a methodology
   dealing with the problem step-by-step production of a web-site based on
   fact sheets for heritage owners and managers. The fact sheets are
   divided amongst different subjects and are designed to be informative
   and easy to use for owners and responsible authorities.
   Originality/value - The results presented in this paper will increase
   the knowledge of how owners of cultural heritage can be prepared for
   climate change on a practical, hands-on level. This can, for example, be
   done by a brief overall analysis of the threats of the cultural heritage
   in a specific municipality. The analysis can be summarised in a list of
   increased possible risks, with direct practical information given to
   those needing it, and placed online. This would enable detection of and
   reaction to warning signs of an unusual situation. Information, training
   and production of both general and specific plans for action in case of
   extreme situations are also important in order to prevent the negative
   effects of climate change.},

Title = {From global to regional and back again: common climate stressors of
   marine ecosystems relevant for adaptation across five ocean warming
   hotspots},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2038-2053},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ocean warming `hotspots' are regions characterized by above-average
   temperature increases over recent years, for which there are significant
   consequences for both living marine resources and the societies that
   depend on them. As such, they represent early warning systems for
   understanding the impacts of marine climate change, and test-beds for
   developing adaptation options for coping with those impacts. Here, we
   examine five hotspots off the coasts of eastern Australia, South Africa,
   Madagascar, India and Brazil. These particular hotspots have underpinned
   a large international partnership that is working towards improving
   community adaptation by characterizing, assessing and projecting the
   likely future of coastal-marine food resources through the provision and
   sharing of knowledge. To inform this effort, we employ a high-resolution
   global ocean model forced by Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5
   and simulated to year 2099. In addition to the sea surface temperature,
   we analyse projected stratification, nutrient supply, primary
   production, anthropogenic CO2-driven ocean acidification, deoxygenation
   and ocean circulation. Our simulation finds that the temperature-defined
   hotspots studied here will continue to experience warming but, with the
   exception of eastern Australia, may not remain the fastest warming ocean
   areas over the next century as the strongest warming is projected to
   occur in the subpolar and polar areas of the Northern Hemisphere.
   Additionally, we find that recent rapid change in SST is not necessarily
   an indicator that these areas are also hotspots of the other climatic
   stressors examined. However, a consistent facet of the hotspots studied
   here is that they are all strongly influenced by ocean circulation,
   which has already shown changes in the recent past and is projected to
   undergo further strong change into the future. In addition to the fast
   warming, change in local ocean circulation represents a distinct feature
   of present and future climate change impacting marine ecosystems in
   these areas.},

Title = {Coastal management, climate change adaptation and sustainability in
   small coastal communities: leatherback turtles and beach loss},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Beaches are frequently subjected to erosion and accretion that are
   influenced by coastal development interventions and natural variations
   due to storms and changes in river flow. Climate change may also
   exacerbate beach erosion and accretion. Natural scientists are concerned
   with the sustainability of species dependent on the beach ecosystem.
   Policymakers are pre-occupied with the economic sustainability of
   coastal communities should species decline and prolonged beach loss
   occur. The aim of this paper is to explore the linkage between science
   and policy by reporting the findings of a study of coastal change
   impacts on leatherback turtle nesting and analysing the socio-economic
   and adaptation implications of these changes for coastal communities.
   Grande Riviere, Trinidad, was used as a case study. Primary fieldwork
   investigated unsustainable coastal management practices. A questionnaire
   was administered to examine livelihoods, including ecotourism based on
   leatherback turtle nesting, and knowledge and awareness of climate
   change. One key finding of the study was that the community's
   livelihoods were natural resources dependent, and that natural beach
   dynamics and unsustainable coastal management practices posed major
   threats to natural resource and economic sustainability. Another key
   finding was that, despite these impacts, community knowledge and
   awareness of climate change in general was low, and there was a
   perception of state responsibility for climate change adaptation. The
   research findings have global applicability for coastal communities at
   risk of exposure and that are highly vulnerable to natural resources
   damage arising from anthropogenic stress and potential climate change.
   These communities require policy reforms to strengthen current coastal
   management practices and adaptation responses aimed at ensuring
   long-term sustainability.},

Abstract = {Yoga induces long-term changes in respiratory function and control. We
   tested whether it represents a successful strategy for high-altitude
   adaptation. We compared ventilatory, cardiovascular and hematological
   parameters in: 12 Caucasian yoga trainees and 12 control sea-level
   residents, at baseline and after 2-week exposure to high altitude
   (Pyramid Laboratory, Nepal, 5,050 m), 38 active lifestyle high-altitude
   natives (Sherpas) and 13 contemplative lifestyle high-altitude natives
   with practice of yoga-like respiratory exercises (Buddhist monks)
   studied at 5,050 m. At baseline, hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), red
   blood cell count and hematocrit were lower in Caucasian yoga trainees
   than in controls. After 14 days at altitude, yoga trainees showed
   similar oxygen saturation, blood pressure, RR interval compared to
   controls, but lower HVR (-0.44 +/- 0.08 vs. -0.98 +/- 0.21
   l/min/m/\%SaO(2), P < 0.05), minute ventilation (8.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 10.8
   +/- 1.6 l/min, P < 0.05), breathing rate (indicating higher ventilatory
   efficiency), and lower red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit,
   albumin, erythropoietin and soluble transferrin receptors. Hypoxic
   ventilatory response in monks was lower than in Sherpas (-0.23 +/- 0.05
   vs. -0.63 +/- 0.09 l/min/m/\%SaO(2), P < 0.05); values were similar to
   baseline data of yoga trainees and Caucasian controls, respectively. Red
   blood cell count and hematocrit were lower in monks as compared to
   Sherpas. In conclusion, Caucasian subjects practicing yoga maintain a
   satisfactory oxygen transport at high altitude, with minimal increase in
   ventilation and with reduced hematological changes, resembling Himalayan
   natives. Respiratory adaptations induced by the practice of yoga may
   represent an efficient strategy to cope with altitude-induced hypoxia.},

Title = {Social Vulnerability to Climate Change in Temperate Forest Areas: New
   Measures of Exposure, Sensitivity, and Adaptive Capacity},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {108},
Number = {3},
Pages = {658-678},
Abstract = {Human communities in forested areas that are expected to experience
   climate-related changes have received little attention in the scholarly
   literature on vulnerability assessment. Many communities rely on forest
   ecosystems to support their social and economic livelihoods. Climate
   change could alter these ecosystems. We developed a framework that
   measures social vulnerability to slow-onset climate-related changes in
   forest ecosystems. We focused on temperate forests because this biome is
   expected to experience dramatic change in the coming years, with adverse
   effects for humans. We advance climate change vulnerability science by
   making improvements to measures of exposure and sensitivity and by
   incorporating a measure of adaptive capacity. We improved on other
   methods of assessing exposure by incorporating climate change model
   projections and thus a temporal perspective. We improved on other
   methods of assessing sensitivity by incorporating a variable
   representing interdependency between human populations and forests. We
   incorporated a measure of adaptive capacity to account for ways
   socioeconomic conditions might mitigate exposure and sensitivity. Our
   geographic focus was the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.
   We found that fifteen of the region's seventy-five counties were highly
   vulnerable to climate-related changes due to some combination of
   exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Nine counties were highly
   vulnerable because they ranked very high in terms of exposure and
   sensitivity and very low in terms of adaptive capacity. The framework we
   developed could be useful for investigations of vulnerability to climate
   change in other forested contexts and in other ecological contexts where
   slow-onset changes might be expected under future climate conditions.},

Abstract = {In June 2018, >600 scientists from over 50 countries attended the Fourth
   International Symposium on the Effects of Climate Change on the World's
   Oceans (ECCWO-4). ECCWO-4 provided a forum for scientists to share

   impacts on oceans and the many people, businesses and communities that
   depend on them. Seven Key Messages emerging from the symposium and
   relevant information from recently published literature are summarized.
   Recent scientific advances are improving our ability to understand,
   project, and assess the consequences of different levels of 21st century
   climate change for ocean ecosystems and ocean dependent communities.
   Outcomes of the symposium highlighted the need for on-going engagement
   with stakeholders, communities, and managers when considering the
   trade-offs associated with tactical and strategic opportunities for
   adaptation to climate change. Science informed adaptation frameworks
   that engage the public in their development are needed for effective
   management of marine resources in a changing climate. The summary
   provides a brief overview of the advances in climate-ocean science
   emerging from the symposium and provides context for the contributed
   papers within the broader socio-ecological advances of the discipline.},

   Nino events occur},

Abstract = {In 2015, El Nino contributed to severe droughts in equatorial Asia (EA).
   The severe droughts enhanced fire activity in the dry season
   (June-November), leading to massive fire emissions of CO2 and aerosols.
   Based on large event attribution ensembles of the MIR005 atmospheric
   global climate model, we suggest that historical anthropogenic warming
   increased the chances of meteorological droughts exceeding the 2015
   observations in the EA area. We also investigate changes in drought in
   future climate simulations, in which prescribed sea surface temperature
   data have the same spatial patterns as the 2015 El Nino with long-term
   warming trends. Large probability increases of stronger droughts than
   the 2015 event are projected when events like the 2015 El Nino occur in
   the 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C warmed climate ensembles according to the
   Paris Agreement goals. Further drying is projected in the 3.0 degrees C
   ensemble according to the current mitigation policies of nations.
   We use observation-based empirical functions to estimate burned area,
   fire CO2 emissions and fine (<2.5 mu m) particulate matter (PM2.5)
   emissions from these simulations of precipitation. There are no
   significant increases in the chances of burned area and CO2 and PM2.5
   emissions exceeding the 2015 observations due to past anthropogenic
   climate change. In contrast, even if the 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C goals are
   achieved, there are significant increases in the burned area and CO2 and
   PM2.5 emissions. If global warming reaches 3.0 degrees C, as is expected
   from the current mitigation policies of nations, the chances of burned
   areas and CO2 and PM2.5 emissions exceeding the 2015 observed values
   become approximately 100 \%, at least in the single model ensembles.
   We also compare changes in fire CO2 emissions due to climate change and
   the land-use CO2 emission scenarios of five shared socioeconomic
   pathways, where the effects of climate change on fire are not
   considered. There are two main implications. First, in a national policy
   context, future EA climate policy will need to consider these climate
   change effects regarding both mitigation and adaptation aspects. Second
   is the consideration of fire increases changing global CO2 emissions and
   mitigation strategies, which suggests that future climate change
   mitigation studies should consider these factors.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how the changing pattern
   of climatic conditions is likely to impact tourism in Small island
   developing states (SIDS). Further, the study suggests appropriate
   management practices that could help in tackling the consequences of
   climate change on the tourism sector in SIDS.
   Design/methodology/approach Recently published articles and reports are
   analysed in relation to the effects of climate change on the tourism
   sector, and approaches to improve the resilience of tourism in SIDS.
   Findings The study has discovered the likely effects of climate change
   on the tourism business and found a high possibility of a decline in the
   tourism-based economy as an outcome. Furthermore, the study found that
   the absence of institutional alliances, government backing, resilient
   policy and advanced technological mechanisms are driving the associated
   risks of climate change in tourism. Practical implications The framework

Title = {Ecosystem-Based Adaptation for the Impact of Climate Change and
   Variation in the Water Management Sector of Sri Lanka},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {The climate of Sri Lanka has been fluctuating at an alarming rate during
   the recent past. These changes are reported to have pronounced impacts
   on the livelihoods of the people in the country. Water is central to the
   sustainable functioning of ecosystems and wellbeing of mankind. It is
   evident that pronounced variations in the climate will negatively impact
   the availability and the quality of water resources. The ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) approach has proved to be an effective strategy to
   address the impact of climate change on water resources in many parts of
   the world. The key aim of this paper is to elaborate the wide range of
   benefits received through implementation of EbAs in field level,
   watershed scale, and urban and coastal environments in the context of
   Sri Lanka. In addition, this paper discusses the benefits of utilizing
   EbA solutions over grey infrastructure-based solutions to address the
   issues related to water management. The wide range of benefits received
   through implementation of EbAs can be broadly classified into three
   categories: water supply regulation, water quality regulation, and
   moderation of extreme events. This paper recommends the utilization of
   EbAs over grey infrastructure-based solutions in adaptation to climate
   change in the water management sector for the developing region due its
   cost effectiveness, ecofriendliness, and multiple benefits received on
   long-term scales. The findings of this study will unequivocally
   contribute to filling existing knowledge and research gaps in the
   context of EbAs to future climate change in Sri Lanka. The suggestions
   and opinions of this study can be taken into account by decision makers
   and water resources planning agencies for future planning of actions
   related to climate change adaptation in Sri Lanka.},

Abstract = {It will be extremely difficult to control worldwide sources of carbon
   over the next century in order to limit atmospheric carbon dioxide to
   twice pre-anthropogenic levels. This paper first discusses the options
   for CO2 mitigation, estimates their respective carbon reduction
   potentials, and then focuses on the research agenda to evaluate
   alternative terrestrial and marine systems for CO2 mitigation. The
   options being evaluated include: a) terrestrial reforestation strategies
   and halophyte production in semi-arid regions, b) algal refossilization
   of carbon dioxide and algal-induced carbon dioxide fixation, c)
   structured marine farms for energy and food production, and d) carbon
   dioxide clathrate formation and sequestration. EPRI is currently
   conducting fundamental research in each of these areas.  Many of these
   technological approaches will require intemational cooperation and
   acceptance, if they are to be deployed over the large areas necessary to
   fix and sequester CO2. Although the program is in its infancy, there are
   significant potentials for modulating terrestrial and marine systems to
   stimulate carbon removal from the atmosphere.},

Title = {Vulnerability assessment and adaptation to the impacts of sea level rise
   on the Kingdom of Bahrain},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper assesses quantitatively the impact of sea level rise (SLR) at
   the global and regional scale as a result of climate change (CC) on the
   coastal areas of the Kingdom of Bahrain's islands (36 Islands). The
   standard Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines was
   modified as appropriate for the situation of the study area. Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) coupled with Remote Sensing (RS) were used as
   the main techniques of collecting, analyzing, modeling simulating and
   disseminating information to build SLR scenarios in a geographically
   referenced context. Also, these tools were used to assess vulnerability
   and risk of the coastal area of the islands with the expectation that
   coastal planner and government authorities will profit from integrating
   these knowledge into a broad based environmental decision making. Three
   SLR scenarios: low, moderate and high were developed to examine the
   impacts from SLR on all islands. The low SLR scenario (Optimistic)
   assumes a 0.5-m rise above current sea level, the moderate scenario
   (Intermediate) assumes a one meter rise, and the high scenario
   (Pessimistic) assumes a 1.5 m rise in sea level. Two more SLR scenarios
   were assumed to perform risk analysis, a 2 and 5 meter rise above
   current sea level. The simulation of SLR are quite straightforward,
   emphasizing on the uses of both of the data that are incorporated from
   the satellite images and the created Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to
   estimate SLR scenarios that are adapted in the study. These data were
   used to predict consequences of the possibility of the rise in sea level
   at different scenarios which may alter the landuse and patterns of human
   communities. Results indicate that low-lying coastal areas of Bahrain
   islands are at risk from the effects of any SLR resulting from CC. These
   islands are vulnerable under different SLR Scenarios. More than 17\% of
   the country total area may be inundated under 1.5 m SLR in 2100. The
   total area that might be lost under different sea level scenarios will
   vary from more than 77 km(2) if SLR reaches 0.5 m, to about 100 km(2)
   under 1.0 m SLR and may reach 124 km(2) under 1.5 m SLR scenario. The
   total inundated areas due to risk scenarios will reach 133 km 2, if the
   SLR rises to 2.0 m, and it is estimated to be more than (22\%) of the
   main island total area. Under the second scenario, if the SLR reaches
   5.0 m, the main islands will lose approximately half of its area (47\%)
   equal to 280 km(2). Hawar islands group will lose about (30\%) of its
   total area under 2.0 m SLR, which is about 15.5 km(2). A SLR adaptation
   policy framework (APF) and adaptation policy initiatives (APIs) are
   suggested for planners to build upon for reducing the likely effects of
   SLR in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The framework is composed of four steps
   namely, acquisition of information, planning and design, implementation
   and monitoring and evaluation. A general policy framework for a national
   response to SLR is suggested. Additionally, a range of policy adaptation
   options/initiatives to sustain coastal developments under the likely
   effects of SLR are recommended.},

Title = {``Disasters threaten livelihoods, and people cope, adapt and make
   transformational changes{''}: Community resilience and livelihoods
   reconstruction in coastal communities of Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the face of serious disruptions to local livelihoods and asset bases
   by extreme climatic events, it is paramount to reconstruct but also to
   transform and diversify livelihoods. However, the literature on these
   aspects is scant. In this paper, we posit that two frameworks, namely
   the livelihood strategy approach and community resilience thinking, are
   useful tools for effectively analyzing post-disaster transformational
   changes. In the empirical context of coastal communities of Bangladesh,
   our study specifically examines the changes experienced in livelihood
   assets due to Cyclones Sidr and Aila. Two coastal communities, namely
   Nilganj and Dhulasar Unions in the Kalapara Upazila of Patuakhali
   District, were selected to analyze the strategies used by local people
   to cope with and adapt to cyclone and storm surge disaster-shocks.
   Primary data were collected from three sources: a socioeconomic survey
   of 300 households, eight focus group discussions, and 20 key informant
   interviews. Our findings reveal that a significant number of cyclone
   victims were displaced from their homes by recent severe cyclones,
   changed their occupations - both intra- and intersectorally - and
   confronted increased consumption and social costs. We observed
   significant differences in impacts between farmers and those engaged in
   other occupations, such as fishing, with the latter being far more
   likely to change occupation post-disaster. The study uncovered
   significant evidence that local people are learning to live with change
   and uncertainty by nurturing and combining various types of knowledge
   and social memory, generating diversified livelihood options, and
   self-organizing to enhance their resilience to future extreme weather
   events.},

Abstract = {Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in respect of climate
   change. As the African continent struggles to adapt to climate change, a
   variety of measures are being pursued to alleviate the resultant
   pressures on people, properties and their livelihoods in several African
   cities. Collectively, they show that climate change adaptation in Africa
   is not as hopeless as widely claimed, and that there are some promising
   prospects. The literature shows a deficiency on studies which examine
   the extent to which climate change adaptation is being pursued in
   African cities. This paper addresses this need, and outlines some of the
   most important climate threats (e.g. increasing temperatures, droughts,
   sea level rise, sea and river flooding) and synergic non-climate
   factors, as well as recent progress made In respect of implementing
   climate change adaptation in African cities. Rather than adopt a general
   description of trends, this research focuses on concrete case studies
   from six major cities across the central, western, and eastern regions
   of the African continent (Douala, Lagos City, Dar-es-Salaam, Accra,
   Addis Ababa and Mombasa). The vulnerability and adaptive capacity status
   of the studied cities are discussed. Difficulties and challenges
   encountered in implementing adaptation policies in these areas are also
   highlighted. Furthermore, some successful examples of climate change
   adaptation initiatives in the surveyed cities are provided. Finally, the
   paper outlines some of the policy measures which can be implemented
   towards strengthening the capacity of African cities to adapt to a
   changing climate.},

Abstract = {Corals and coral-associated species are highly vulnerable to the
   emerging effects of global climate change. The widespread degradation of
   coral reefs, which will be accelerated by climate change, jeopardizes
   the goods and services that tropical nations derive from reef
   ecosystems. However, climate change impacts to reef social-ecological
   systems can also be bi-directional. For example, some climate impacts,
   such as storms and sea level rise, can directly impact societies, with
   repercussions for how they interact with the environment. This study
   identifies the multiple impact pathways within coral reef
   social-ecological systems arising from four key climatic drivers:
   increased sea surface temperature, severe tropical storms, sea level
   rise and ocean acidification. We develop a novel framework for
   investigating climate change impacts in social-ecological systems, which
   helps to highlight the diverse impacts that must be considered in order
   to develop a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate
   change, as well as developing appropriate management actions to mitigate

Title = {Making an environmental market, unmaking adaptive capacity: Species
   commodification in the New England groundfishery},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates how market-focused natural resource management
   can reduce adaptive capacity to environmental change. It describes
   attempts to standardize socio-ecological phenomena in the New England
   groundfishery for purposes of legal accountability and the development
   of environmental markets. Industry flexibility across harvested species
   has supported a range of informal social networks for the exchange of
   information and other goods and services. Federal catch share policy,
   associated species population assessments, and transferable harvest
   quotas neglect social and ecological diversity that figure centrally in
   adaptation strategies. New quota markets generate a cascade of impacts,
   including intensified capital investment, threats of industry
   consolidation, increased reliance on limited capabilities of fisheries
   science, more acute regulatory uncertainties, narrowing of species
   options, smaller and less predictable profit margins, shifts in industry
   expectations for the future, and changes in fishing practice. Presumed
   market incentives for resource conservation are weakened. State and
   non-profit interventions to protect marine resources and local
   fishing-dependent collectivities may have limited immediate impact, but
   still play important roles in the longer term. Permit banks, alternative
   seafood marketing, and reformist regulatory proposals maintain
   institutional diversity and invigorate informal social relations capable
   of decentralized information sharing and collective action, which are
   essential to more adaptive environmental governance. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Coastal adaptation to climate change through zonation: A review of
   coastal change management areas (CCMAs) in England},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {215},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Climate change and accelerated rates in sea-level rise are expected to
   increase flooding and erosion on the world's coastlines. Coastal
   managers and planners face the challenge of helping communities to adapt
   to the changing coast. Traditionally hard engineering has been used to
   defend communities on the coast, but as this option becomes
   unsustainable and financially unviable, coastal managers are
   increasingly employing planning policy to mitigate the risk posed by
   coastal change. Zonation of coastal change areas and delineation of
   erosion extents, such as set-back lines, are used globally to restrict
   development in the coastal zone. In England there is policy in place to
   allow planning authorities to restrict certain development in areas
   expected to be affected by coastal change. This study aims to examine
   how coastal planning authorities in England have implemented coastal
   change adaptation policies, specifically Coastal Change Management Areas
   (CCMA). These areas should include sections of coast that will
   experience significant change over the next 100 years through erosion,
   accretion or flooding. Through an analysis of planning documents, we
   have found that since the policy was introduced in 2012, only 15\% of
   coastal planning authorities have designated a CCMA, with just 5.7\% of
   the coast of England designated as a CCMA. We have found that inadequate
   and ambiguous guidance has reduced the effectiveness of the national
   policy with coastal planning authorities unsure of which datasets to
   apply for delineating areas of coastal change. This has led to
   vulnerable coastal areas being omitted from CCMAs. The datasets that are
   available for mapping the coastal change areas are found to vary in
   erosion extent and do not account for expected increases in the rate of
   sea-level rise. We suggest that for coastal zonation and climate change
   adaptation policy to be successful, a robust methodology, including a
   classification of coastal typologies and their response to sea level
   rise, is needed to delineate the extent of erosion or coastal change
   over the next 100 years. Understanding and mapping coastal response to
   sea level rise will aid planning authorities to build more resilient
   communities on the coast.},

Abstract = {Climate change will further induce a generalized rise in temperature,
   heat waves, exacerbation of heat island effect, alteration of the
   precipitation regime variability with higher occurrence of high
   precipitation and flood events, reduction of quantity and quality of
   freshwater resources, disruption of agricultural production, leading to
   food security risk, degradation of recreational and aesthetic amenities,

   On other hand, Green Infrastructure, that is, the network of natural and
   semi-natural spaces within and around urban spaces, brings a
   constructive and protecting element that may mitigate and adapt to the
   local level impacts of climate change, strengthening local resilience.
   This paper presents a comparative study of various green
   infrastructures' implementation based on analytics in the United States
   of America, United Kingdom and Portugal, and focuses on the degree of
   its alignment with the public policies of mitigation and adaptation to
   the impacts of climate change. Pursuant to the identification of
   successes and failures, this paper infers common strategies, goals and
   benchmarking on outcomes for more adequate decision implementation and
   sustainable spatial planning, considering the importance of green

Abstract = {Climate change induces non-linear and unevenly distributed changes, such
   rising sea levels and extreme weather events that materialise on the
   regional level and considerably contribute to changes in the social
   fabric of regions, communities and places. Because of the need for
   societal responses, an in-depth understanding of individual and
   collective forms of engagement with climate change is of growing
   relevance. To contribute to close this gap, this paper applies a
   place-based approach for investigating how people's place attachments
   and meanings inform individual and collective engagement with climate
   change. As a case study, the district of North Frisia (Germany) was
   chosen, a region between climate-change vulnerability and
   renewable-energy potential. Qualitative interviews and a household
   survey with coastal dwellers of the municipality of Reuenkoge have been
   conducted, a group discussion with the Country Youth (Landjugend) and
   further interviews with experts from government, companies and
   associations spread over North Frisia and in Kiel. The results reveal
   two main findings: firstly, place-dependent attachments and meanings
   play a pivotal role for understanding people's engagement with climate
   change, and secondly, the behavioural dimension of engagement involves
   diverse adaptation and mitigation measures adopted on individual and
   collective level. In sum, the findings conceptually and empirically
   reveal the importance of memories, experiences, knowledge and creativity
   for how people engage with climate change, but also exhibit the
   importance of policies mobilising community-based actions.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forest plays a significant role for biogeochemical carbon cycle
   in the context of climate change along the tropical coastal area. The
   present study analyzed the land-use and land-cover changes from 1996,
   2006 and 2016 in Lubuk Kertang mangrove forest, Langkat, North Sumatra,
   Indonesia. Mangrove diversity in Lubuk Kertang consists of fifteen
   species, Acanthus ilicifolius, Avicennia marina, A. lanata, A.
   officinalis, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, B. sexangula, Ceriops tagal,
   Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa, L. littorea, R. apiculata, R.
   mucronata, Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea, Sonneratia caseolaris, and
   Xylocarpus granatum. The land use/land cover consists of seven classes
   namely, mangrove forest, river, residential, paddy field, oil palm
   plantation, aquaculture, and open space area. A land use change matrix
   showed that the decrease of mangrove forest 109.4 ha from 1996-2006
   converted to aquaculture 51.5 ha (47.1\%). By contrast, mangrove lost
   291.2 ha during 2006-2016, with main driver deforestation was oil palm
   plantation 128.1 ha (44\%). During twenty years mangrove forest has been
   lost more than 400.4 ha, which is equal to 20.02 ha/year. On the other
   hand, oil palm plantation and aquaculture have been increased 155.3 ha
   and 114.1 ha during 1996-2016, respectively, suggested that both
   land-uses are mainly responsible for mangrove deforestation. These data
   are likely to contribute towards coastal management planning and
   practice and mitigating actions for emission reduction scenario.},

Abstract = {Through the construction of a socio-ecological timeline for the
   Porsanger fjord ecosystem, this article illustrates the different ways
   in which environmental and social-ecological changes have influenced the
   adaptations of rural households in coastal Sami communities in Finnmark,
   north Norway. The main finding is that, although environmental change in
   the form of seal invasions and dwindling fish stocks directly impacted
   the fisheries, the introduction of a new vessel quota system decisively
   changed adaptive capacity and coastal Sami household adaptation
   strategies. These changes represented a tipping point for the
   social-ecological system in the period between 1986 and 1990. It is thus
   important to discuss the ways in which governance systems may facilitate
   actions to adapt to climate and biodiversity change and foster
   sustainable rural livelihood systems in coastal Norway. Based on
   traditional and local ecological knowledge on the state of the ecosystem
   prior to the tipping point, two relevant actions to increase the
   resilience of the system were identified: ensuring the possibility of
   re-entry into fisheries as part of rural livelihood combinations, and
   ecological restoration of kelp beds. Flexible diversification of
   livelihoods allows exploitation of a range of adjacent species without
   large investments in a fossile fuel-driven fisheries economy. Investing
   in regrowth of macroalgae to foster cod nursery areas and increase
   carbon sequestration can be a relevant alternative for communities that
   are interested in contributing to climate change mitigation on a larger
   scale.},

Title = {A systemic view of potential environmental impacts of ocean energy
   production},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Renewable ocean energy is an alternative that will help reduce carbon
   emissions into the atmosphere. However, there is uncertainty about
   potential environmental impacts of the technologies involved, because
   these are new and untested, and methods for the evaluation and
   monitoring of environmental impacts are scarce. We performed a
   systematic literature review (well-structured and organized, always
   looking for the same terms), followed by a systemic analysis in which we
   considered the interactions between environmental stressors, effects,
   receptors, and their responses. We found that most studies are
   theoretical revisions and modelling exercises, although field and
   laboratory experiments and observations are beginning to accumulate.
   Environmental stressors are features in the environment
   (energy-harvesting devices) that modify the natural dynamics of the
   system. The effects are the changes in the environment induced by the
   stressors; the most frequently acknowledged and measured are noise,
   collision, habitat change, hydro-sedimentary dynamics and wave
   modifications. The receptors of these changes are marine fauna, such as
   mammals, fish, sea birds, and benthic communities, as well as the
   shoreline. Their corresponding responses include behaviour,
   injuries/death, biodiversity loss, alterations in food webs and
   shoreline change. Once the different components of the environmental
   impacts are identified, it is important to develop monitoring and
   mitigation strategies to prevent, or minimize, environmental damage.
   Ocean energy is a promising option to reduce CO2 emissions into the
   atmosphere, but the implementation of adequate monitoring and mitigation
   technologies requires multidisciplinary efforts to obtain effectively
   clean, renewable energy and to maintain healthy and functional
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {A survey of 114 households residing in Manicani Island on their capital
   assets and coping strategies as determinants of their resiliency on
   Typhoon Haiyan was undertaken. KII and FG validated the survey results.
   Relationship between capital assets and coping strategies was determined
   using chi-square test and their degree of association was determined
   using phi coefficient and Cramer's V. Results showed that (a) the
   households' house condition before the typhoon and knowledge of the
   typhoon were moderately associated (0.22 to 0.23) with securing houses
   at 0.05 significance level; (b) the educational attainment of household
   head was moderately associated (0.34) with safekeeping of household
   assets/personal belongings at 0.01 significance level; (c) the condition
   of the house after the typhoon, length of time before house
   reconstruction and person in-charge in reconstruction have moderate to
   relatively strong association (0.28 to 0.44) with the housing recovery
   of the households at 0.01 significance level; and (d) livestock
   ownership after the typhoon and person in charge in house reconstruction
   were weakly to moderately related (0.17 to 0.26) with the household's
   income recovery at 0.10 and 0.05 significance level, respectively. This
   implies that capital assets are important in coping with disasters. The
   local government can use these results for planning and improving its
   disaster risk reduction and management program especially on extreme
   events similar to Typhoon Yolanda.},

Title = {Rapid human-driven undermining of atoll island capacity to adjust to
   ocean climate-related pressures},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Most studies addressing the future of atoll islands focused on
   ocean-climate drivers of risk, especially sea-level rise, and
   disregarded the role of local human disturbances. However, the future
   habitability of these countries will critically depend on the response
   of inhabited and exploited islands to ocean-climate pressures. Here,
   using the Maldives as a case study and based on a database including 608
   islands (representing 56.8\% and 86.0\% of the country's land area and
   population, respectively), we assess the influence of human disturbances
   on island natural response capacity over the last decade. We show that
   over the last decade, island change was rapid and primarily controlled
   by anthropogenic drivers. The great majority of inhabited and exploited
   islands now exhibit an altered-to-annihilated capacity to respond to
   ocean-climate pressures, which has major implications for future
   research and adaptation strategies. First, future studies should
   consider not only climate, but also anthropogenic tipping points (in
   contrast to climate tipping points). Second, adaptation strategies must
   be implemented without delay, despite climate uncertainties, in order to
   contain any additional detrimental path-dependency effects. This study
   provides critical information for better addressing the attribution
   issue under climate change, and a replicable rapid assessment frame.},

Title = {Analysis of Transportation Disruptions from Recent Flooding and Volcanic

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},

Volume = {2673},
Number = {2},
Pages = {194-208},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe, analyze, and compare
   disruptions to the transportation system from two recent disasters in
   Hawai'i. While they occurred on different islands (Kaua'i and Hawai'i)
   and resulted from different hazards (flooding and volcanic eruption),
   there are important commonalities due to the disruption of surface
   transportation and the consequences for evacuation and emergency
   services as well as response and recovery. On Kaua'i, the physical
   impacts were fewer, with a 2 mile stretch of highway damaged by flooding
   and landslides as compared with 31.1 miles of roads covered by lava on
   Hawaii island. Both disasters had similar population impacts, with 5,566
   people impacted for Kaua'i and 5,563 for Hawai'i. Another difference is
   a shorter duration of disruption and a quicker restoration of
   transportation services for Kaua'i compared with the slower, continuous,
   and permanent loss of transportation services in Hawaii. The two cases
   provide learning opportunities for emergency managers, transportation
   planners, and engineers. Both demonstrate the need for redundancy in
   transportation infrastructure for rescue and recovery operations. While
   the evacuation from a flooding event is different than from a
   slower-moving volcanic crisis, the importance of staging areas, route
   planning, alternative travel modes, and training cannot be
   overemphasized. These disasters focus attention on the critical role of
   transportation systems in response and recovery. In addition to
   short-term operational actions, longer-term mitigation, adaptation, and
   risk reduction strategies are needed to support transportation
   resilience.},

Title = {Adapting governance for coastal change in Portugal},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {314-325},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In many countries, but particularly in Portugal, coastal conditions are
   already endangered by flooding and erosion, both likely to increase as a
   result of climate change. This daunting prospect raises critical
   questions of sustainability; social justice; genuine public
   participation and social learning; effective financing for long term
   social and economic benefit; connected polycentric governance; and the
   appropriate use of scientific knowledge bonded to public and political
   trust. While the development of most shorelines is nominally shaped by
   public administrative action, rapid coastal migration and excessive
   economic concentration have turned many threatened coastlines into a
   stage for settlement hazard and institutional chaos. In Portugal,
   despite clear evidence of increasing flooding and erosion, appropriate
   management responses are proving inadequate, both in the turbulent
   planning framework and in the scarce financial provision for future
   safeguard. The only plausible alternatives seem to lie in the processes
   of progressive adaptive governance, involving the trust and full
   participation of local communities; strongly supported scientific
   assessments of threat and safety; and fresh approaches to finding
   suitable funding sources. However, as evident from interviews with key
   actors in coastal planning in Portugal, the lack of policy clarity and
   political will, the weak science and poor coordination of stakeholders,
   combined with the particular regenerating coastal cultures of these
   communities, make any organised adaptive approaches highly problematic.
   This consequently places more emphasis on the rich cultural meanings of
   coastal occupation; of national identity in a time of economic crisis;
   of social justice in a period of reduced coastal maintenance funding;
   and of a more measured and sequential approach to an adaptive coastal
   governance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Perception of threats and related management measures: The case of 32
   marine protected areas in West Africa},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of surveys conducted with managers of
   West African Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and focuses on the threats
   and the extent to which they are taken into account in the management
   process. The data and information derived from the surveys are used to
   provide a reference situation and to develop a complete inventory of
   threats faced by MPAs in the region. MPA managers identified unmanaged
   fisheries, coastal erosion, overexploitation of natural resources and
   pollution as the main threats to the sustainability of MPAs in the
   region. Climate change, although considered to be diffuse, is also a
   concern for managers. However, management measures are aimed
   (predominantly) at preventing overfishing and the overexploitation of
   terrestrial natural resources. Therefore, coastal erosion, pollution and
   climate change are only indirectly (and marginally) targeted by these
   management measures. Moreover, the management measures implemented i.e.
   monitoring, awareness raising and surveillance are insufficient and
   mainly aligned with the capacity of the local institutions. However,
   what is actually needed is more far reaching and adaptive actions to
   mitigate the current threats. The low financial, technical and human
   resources largely explain the limited scope of management actions taken.
   Coupled with the information and data deficit, which increases the
   inertia regarding threats that have been recurrent for more than a
   decade, management measures have not been sufficient in managing MPAs in
   the region. This paper recommends that the links between pressures on
   MPAs, technical recommendations and resulting management actions must be
   reinforced.},

Abstract = {Over recent decades, Boston has been affected by several tidal floods
   due to sea level rise. In addition to hurricanes, Sandy and Irene, are
   the storms occurring at high tide bringing damaging floods to coastal
   communities, causing major damage to the historical neighborhoods and
   developing areas, specifically, new Seaport District. Like other
   historical ports in the United States, most of Boston, including the new
   Seaport District, has neighborhoods/commercial districts built on filled
   coastline. Within recent years, the Seaport District has experienced
   significant economic increase in businesses/residents. This area has
   been revived and a thriving community has formed. However, solid
   mitigation to handle extreme weather and rising seawater is lacking.
   During the winter storms on 2018 in which the rising sea water flooded
   neighborhoods, Boston saw the storm surge as a threat to continual
   development in the Seaport District and around the city. One great storm
   surge could cause enormous economic damage to the city's coastlines.
   Several towns in Massachusetts have adopted their own mitigation plans.
   Boston is researching and exploring the economic and life safety issues
   to address or prepare for the changing climate. Adopting a formal plan
   is vital to preserving and protecting Boston's rich history and
   neighborhoods. This paper addresses mitigation measures to form a robust
   plan for policy makers, useful recommendations for engineers and
   designers working on infrastructure/buildings in coastal communities.
   These mitigation measures include protecting life safety equipment, MEP
   services/equipment, structural durability, accessibility with flood
   events, functional design recommendations for at-risk buildings, and
   retention.},

   during Heat Waves},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Urban-induced thermal stress can threaten human health, especially
   during heat waves (HWs). The growth of cities further exacerbates this
   effect. Here, weather research and forecasting (WRF) with an urban
   canopy model (UCM) is used to assess the effects of megacities and their
   growth on the thermal regime of proximal cities during heat waves.
   Analysis of the heat fluxes shows that advection impacts cities
   downwind. Results indicate that as urban areas change size (50\%-100\%
   and 100-150\% of their current size), the local 2 m temperature
   increases by 2.7 and 1.7 degrees C, and the 2 m specific humidity
   decreases by 2.1 and 1.4 g kg(-1), respectively. A small city downwind
   is impacted with a 0.3-0.4 degrees C increase in 2 m temperature. Green
   roof is a potential mitigation strategy for these regions (i.e., beyond
   the megacity). With 50\% green roofs in an urban area, a 0.5 degrees C
   decrease in 2 m temperature and 0.6 g kg(-1) increase in specific
   humidity is simulated. Urbanization upwind of a megacity will contribute
   to regional climate change.},

Abstract = {The frequency and intensity of urban heatwaves (UHWs) have been growing
   worldwide due to climate change and the exacerbating effects of urban
   heat islands (UHIEs). UHWs have many negative impacts, including excess
   negative health outcomes (e.g. morbidity), energy (consumption and peak
   demand) and water consumption. Most studies have evaluated these impacts
   separately even though there is an interplay between them. The study
   assessed the daily excess morbidity, energy demand and consumption, and
   water supply in the Adelaide metropolitan region during heatwaves,
   between January 2008 and March 2014. The assessment quantifies the
   thresholds and the increase in each impact relative to temperature
   increase. The demonstrated negative impacts on public health, and energy
   and water resources, potentially exacerbated by UHIEs, justify the
   importance of interdisciplinary research and integrated policy changes
   on the mitigation of and adaptation to heatwaves. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Title = {Utilizing a cellular automaton model to explore the influence of coastal
   flood adaptation strategies on Helsinki's urbanization patterns},
Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A cellular automaton model (SLEUTH-3r) is utilized to explore the
   impacts of coastal flood risk management strategies on the urbanization
   parameters of Helsinki's metropolitan area, at a 50-m spatial resolution
   by 2040. The current urbanization trend is characterized by the
   consolidation of existing built-up land and loss of interspersed green
   spaces, whereas the most intense growth is forecast inside the coastal
   flood risk areas. This baseline is compared to strategies that test
   various responses of the planning system to real estate market forces
   and the spatial distribution of flood risks. A set of scenarios
   translates property price effects of flood risk information into various
   attraction-repulsion areas in and adjacent to the floodplain, while a
   second set explores varying degrees of restricting new growth in the
   flood risk zones without reference to the housing market.
   The simulations indicate that growth under all scenarios is distributed
   in a more fragmented manner relative to the baseline, which can be
   interpreted favorably regarding house prices and increased access to
   ecosystem services, although the indirect effects should also be
   considered. Demand for coastal flood-safe properties does not appear to
   automatically translate to refocusing of development toward those areas,
   unless planning interventions encourage this redistribution. The
   character of the planning system with respect to market drivers and the
   spatial distribution of risks and amenities is thus important. A mixture
   of market-based measures and moderate zoning interventions may be
   preferable for flood risk management and provide the necessary precision
   for adaptation strategies. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Despite all international, national and local initiatives to mitigate
   climate change, a certain degree of climate change is unavoidable. Urban
   environments in particular seem vulnerable to the consequences of
   climate change. How can cities, which are dynamic systems where most
   people live and work, prepare for such changes in climate? In the
   Netherlands, the Climate Proof Cities (CPC) research program (2010
   -2014) was established, aimed at: ``strengthening the adaptive capacity
   and reducing the vulnerability of the urban system against climate
   change and to develop strategies and policy instruments for adapting our
   cities and buildings{''}. The program has contributed to the knowledge
   on assessing vulnerability of cities, on adaptation options and their
   effectiveness, and on governance of adaptation. Important features are
   the role of green infrastructures in combination with available water,
   improved building designs and collaboration between urban planners and
   water managers. Nonetheless, in spite of this effort and many other
   national and international efforts, research in these fields is still in
   its infancy, and much remains to be done. The broad scope of the CPC
   research program incited the establishment of this Special Issue. In
   addition, also papers from other researchers have been added to this
   Special Issue, in an attempt to provide a valuable - albeit inexhaustive
   - view on the challenges and achievements in adaptation of cities to
   climate change. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {What might `just green enough' urban development mean in the context of
   climate change adaptation? The case of urban greenspace planning in
   Taipei Metropolis, Taiwan},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {107},
Pages = {224-238},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper argues that climate change adaptation through strategic
   greenspace planning requires scholars and planners to think differently
   about what equity means in an urban greenspace context. We use the heat
   mitigation potential of greenspace and the case of Taipei Metropolis in
   Taiwan to assess challenges arising from thinking about fairness in
   terms of distribution of benefits from greenspace functions, as opposed
   to fairness in greenspace accessibility and availability. Urban greening
   to foster `resilient' communities arguably deflects from - or even
   exacerbates - structural causes of vulnerability, with benefits accruing
   disproportionately to more affluent or empowered groups. Yet the need
   for practical action on climate threats in cities is urgent, and for
   heat, strategic greenspace use considered systematically across a city
   may mitigate effects through the cooling effect of vegetation. The
   challenge is thus to balance the justice concerns associated with urban
   greening with this tangible risk reduction potential.
   We undertake content analysis of articles from two Taiwanese newspapers
   - the Taipei Times and the China Post - to assess how heat and
   greenspace issues have been discussed in urban governance debates within
   Taipei. We suggest change adaptation through urban greening raises three
   challenges for equity thinking: (a) guiding planning and governance
   processes with scientific understanding of how green space functions are
   delivered, even in the face of urban development pressures and
   site-specific controversies; (b) tempering the social cohesion and
   practical deployment benefits of neighbourhood-level greening with the
   need for specific understanding at the city-wide level to most
   effectively realise ecosystem services; and (c) linking targeted
   adaptation actions with broader rationales for urban greening, whilst
   not diluting justice concerns. We caution that pragmatism towards all
   urban climate adaptation via greening as intrinsically `good' must not
   serve as a blinder to the need for accompanying social policy measures
   to reduce unequal vulnerability to climate risks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Perceptions of the populace play a central and decisive role in
   advancing pro-environmental policies. To study attitudes and perceptions
   towards environmental measures, we apply several items of New Ecological
   Paradigm (NEP) and Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theories to cross-examine the
   public perceptions of climate change in the urban city-state of
   Singapore through analysis of quantitative questionnaires and
   qualitative semi-structured interviews. The perceptions were explored
   about ecological orientation (two dimensions of NEP: level of concern,
   self-reported knowledge) and environmental behavior (two dimensions of
   VBN: acceptance and support of national adaptation measures, confidence
   in adaptation). There is a moderate to high concern for climate change,
   in general, and sea level rise and flooding, in particular, and the
   concern is expected to increase in the future. Individuals who indicated
   a higher level of concern are likely to be more accepting and supportive
   of climate change measures. Also, while the majority of the populace are
   amenable to legislative measures from the government, such as enacting
   pro-environmental laws and more are agreeable to accepting cuts on
   living standards, as opposed to paying more in prices and taxes.
   Ecological orientation does not translate directly into environmental
   behavior, highlighting the gulf between perception and behavior in
   Singapore.},

Title = {Using Historical Responses to Shoreline Change on Australia's Gold Coast
   to Estimate Costs of Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level Rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts, sea level rise, and changes to the frequency and
   intensity of storms, in particular, are projected to increase the
   coastal land and assets exposed to coastal erosion. The selection of
   appropriate adaptation strategies requires an understanding of the costs
   and how such costs will vary by the magnitude and timing of climate
   change impacts. By drawing comparisons between past events and climate
   change projections, it is possible to use experience of the way
   societies have responded to changes to coastal erosion to inform the
   costs and selection of adaptation strategies at the coastal settlement
   scale. The experience of implementing a coastal protection strategy for
   the Gold Coast's southern beaches between 1964 and 1999 is compiled into
   a database of the timing, units, and cost of coastal protection works.
   Records of the change to shoreline position and characteristics of local
   beaches are analysed through the Bruun model to determine the implied
   sea level rise at the time each of the projects was completed. Finally,
   an economic model updates the project costs for the point in the future
   based on the projected timing of sea level rise and calculates a net
   present value (NPV) for implementing a protection strategy, per km, of
   sandy beach shoreline against each of the four representative
   concentration pathways (RCP) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) to 2100. A key finding of our study is the significant
   step-up in expected costs of implementing coastal protection between RCP
   2.6 and RCP 8.5-from \$573,792/km to \$1.7 million/km, or a factor of
   nearly 3, using a social discount rate of 3\%. This step-up is by a
   factor of more than 6 at a social discount rate of 1\%. This step-up in
   projected costs should be of particular interest to agencies responsible
   for funding and building coastal defences.},

Abstract = {Probabilistic climate projections based on two SRES scenarios, an IMAGE
   reference scenario and five IMAGE mitigation scenarios (all of them
   multi-gas scenarios) using the Bern2 5D climate model are calculated
   Probability distributions of climate model parameters that are
   constrained by observations are employed as input for the climate model
   The sensitivity of the resulting distributions with respect to prior
   assumptions on climate sensitivity is then assessed Due to system
   inertia, prior assumptions on climate sensitivity play a minor role in
   the case of temperature projections for the first half of the 21st
   century, but these assumptions have a considerable influence on the
   distributions of the projected temperature increase in the year 2100
   Upper and lower probabilities for exceeding 2 degrees C by the year 2100
   are calculated for the different scenarios Only the most stringent
   mitigation measures lead to low probabilities for exceeding the 2
   degrees C threshold This finding is robust with respect to our prior
   assumptions on climate sensitivity Further, probability distributions of
   total present-value damages over the period 2000-2100 for the different
   scenarios are calculated assuming a wide range of damage cost functions,
   and the sensitivity of these distributions with respect to the assumed
   discount rate is investigated Absolute values of damage costs depend
   heavily on the chosen damage cost function and discount rate
   Nevertheless, some robust conclusions are possible},

   Islands' Blue Economy},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean islands' blue economy and, more specifically, the
   tourism sector, largely regulate Europe's gross product. Climate change
   threatens the ecological, societal, and economic sustainability of the
   islands in many ways, with increasing wildfires making up one of the
   most critical components of the climate change impacts on tourism. Here,
   we aim to identify and assess forest fire vulnerability and risk due to
   climate change for seven Mediterranean islands through the application
   of the ``impact chain{''} conceptual framework. The backbone of this
   approach requires the integration of quantitative and qualitative data
   according to the three main risk components sensu the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), i.e., hazard, exposure, and
   vulnerability, with a structured participatory approach involving
   stakeholders and experts. Our results illustrate the islands with high
   potential for improvement in terms of adapting capacity and, by
   indicating the contribution of the different risk components, highlight
   the main environmental and socio-economic elements that affect the
   islands' vulnerability and risk under climate change. The approach's
   potentials and constraints are discussed, suggesting that the method can
   be handily used to point out the priorities that must be addressed by
   mitigation and adaptation policies and measures at the island level.},

Abstract = {Models to predict budburst and other phenological events in plants are
   needed to forecast how climate change may impact ecosystems and for the
   development of mitigation strategies. Differences among genotypes are
   important to predicting phenological events in species that show strong
   clinal variation in adaptive traits. We present a model that
   incorporates the effects of temperature and differences among genotypes
   to predict the timing of budburst of coast Douglasfir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). The main components of the
   model are (i) functions to calculate the accumulation of chilling units
   (CU) and forcing units (FU) during dormancy and (ii) a function defining
   the combinations of CU and FU needed for budburst (the possibility
   line). The possibility line was fit to data from 59 populations
   subjected to eight different winter environments. Differences among
   populations were incorporated into the possibility line using population
   coefficients that vary the FU required for budburst. Correlations among
   the population coefficients and variables describing local environments
   supported the hypothesis that genetic variation in budburst is largely
   an adaptation to summer drought. The new model can be used to test
   potential seed transfers as a strategy to mitigate some of the effects
   of climate change.},

Title = {Introduction to RISC-KIT: Resilience-increasing strategies for coasts},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {134},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {2-9},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent and historic low-frequency, high-impact events have demonstrated
   the flood risks faced by exposed coastal areas in Europe and beyond.
   These coastal zone risks are likely to increase in the future which
   requires a reevaluation of coastal disaster risk reduction (DRR)
   strategies and a new mix of PMP (prevention, e.g., dike protection;
   mitigation, e.g., limiting construction in flood-prone areas and
   eco-system based solutions; and preparedness, e.g., Early Warning
   Systems, EWS) measures.
   In response to these challenges, the RISC-KIT project has delivered a
   set of open-source and open-access methods, tools and management
   approaches to reduce risk and increase resilience to low-frequency, high
   impact hydro-meteorological events in the coastal zone (the
   ``RISC-toolKIT{''}). These products enhance forecasting, prediction and
   early warning capabilities, improve the assessment of long-term coastal
   risk and optimise the mix of PMP-measures.
   In this paper an introduction is provided to the objectives, products,
   applications and lessons-learned of the RISC-KIT project, which are the
   subjects of this Special Issue. Subsequent papers provide details on the
   tools and their application on 10 case study sites in Europe.},

Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {170-181},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reintroductions are becoming a popular tool to prevent extinctions,
   although their overall success rate is low. Assessing the efficiency and
   cost-effectiveness of different reintroduction strategies may help
   identify and promote efficient practices. Captive-breeding is widely
   used in animal reintroductions, although concerns have been raised about
   relatively high failure rates and economic costs. Here, we compared the
   effectiveness of two simultaneously used strategies in the
   reintroduction of the Bonelli's eagle on the island of Mallorca: The
   release of captive-bred chicks and wild-reared, translocated
   non-juveniles. To do so, we estimated the main vital rates for
   individuals released by both strategies and used these to perform
   population simulations to assess their overall performances. The use of
   wild-reared non-juveniles showed a trend with higher numbers of breeding
   pairs 10 years after the end of releases (14.75 pairs, 95\% CI 4-25 vs.
   11.21 pairs, 95\% CI 2-24) and was the only strategy that prevented
   extinction in the long term. Following that, based on cost estimations
   of every strategy and different reintroduction budgets, we assessed the
   cost-effectiveness of releasing wild-reared non-juveniles compared with
   two captive-breeding alternatives: Releasing chicks either originally
   from breeding programmes or extracted from nests in natural populations.
   Again, releasing wild-reared non-juveniles was the only strategy that
   prevented long-term extinction in all economic scenarios (i.e.
   low-budget scenario 21.49 pairs, 95\% CI 2-25). The use of chicks
   sourced from captive-breeding programmes did not guarantee long-term
   persistence even in high-budget scenarios (14.50 pairs, 95\% CI 0-25).
   Releasing wild-reared non-juveniles boosts early recruitment to the
   breeding population and early reproduction, which can be key for
   reintroduction success. However, in some scenarios, post-release effects
   can be stronger in wild-reared individuals, especially because of high
   translocation stress and post-release dispersal. Hence, we recommend
   undertaking careful evaluation of the pros and cons of every strategy
   and embracing adaptive management to choose best strategies.},

Title = {Spatial management in small-scale fisheries: A potential approach for
   climate change adaptation in Pacific Islands},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {350-358},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries are undeniably important for livelihoods, food
   security and income around the globe. However, they face major
   challenges, including global market and demographic shifts, policy
   changes and climate variations that may threaten the wellbeing, health
   and safety of fishing communities. Over the years, various forms of
   spatial management have been implemented in small-scale fisheries as a
   potential solution to problems afflicting these systems. The benefits of
   such approaches can be numerous for both ecosystems and coastal
   communities. In addition to the persistent challenges influencing
   small-scale fisheries practices, the emerging effects of climate change
   pose serious risks to coastal ecosystems and fishing communities,
   especially in low-lying islands. Despite a growing recognition of both
   the benefits of spatial management and the adverse effects of climate
   change on small-scale fisheries, integration of these concepts in a
   consistent and comprehensive way has not yet occurred. Spatial
   management has the potential to foster small-scale fisheries adaptation
   to climate change, however, in the face of such a global and
   transboundary phenomenon, management strategies will need to be
   carefully designed and implemented. First, key considerations for
   climate-informed spatial management in small-scale fisheries were
   identified. Second, these key considerations were illustrated in two
   selected case studies in Pacific Island countries and territories (i.e.
   Fiji and Papua New Guinea). Finally, the challenges associated with
   spatial management in a changing climate are discussed and ways forward
   for advancing this type of management as a climate adaptation approach
   for small-scale fisheries in the Pacific and beyond are proposed.},

Title = {IS CLIMATE CHANGE THE ``DEFINING CHALLENGE OF OUR AGE{''}?},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {279-302},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change, some claim, is this century's most important
   environmental challenge. Mortality estimates for the year 2000 from the
   World Health Organization (WHO) indicate, however, that a dozen other
   risk factors contribute more to global mortality and global burden of
   disease. Moreover, the state-of-the-art British-sponsored fast track
   assessments (FTAs) of the global impacts of climate change show that
   through 2085-2100, climate change would contribute less to human health
   and environmental threats than other risk factors. Climate change is,
   therefore, unlikely to be the 21(st) century's most important
   environmental problem. Combining the FTA results with WHO's mortality
   estimates indicates that halting climate change would reduce cumulative
   mortality from hunger, malaria, and coastal flooding, by 4-10 percent in
   2085 while the Kyoto Protocol would lower it by 0.4-1 percent. FTA
   results also show that reducing climate change will increase
   populations-at-risk from water stress and, possibly, threats to
   biodiversity. But adaptive measures focused specifically on reducing
   vulnerability to climate sensitive threats would reduce cumulative
   mortality by 50-75 percent at a fraction of the Kyoto Protocol's cost
   without adding to risks from water stress or to biodiversity. Such
   ``focused adaptation{''} would, moreover, reduce major hurdles to the
   developing world's sustainable economic development, lack of which is
   the major reason for its vulnerability to climate change (and any other
   form of adversity). Thus, focused adaptation can combat climate change
   and advance global well-being, particularly of the world's most
   vulnerable populations, more effectively than aggressive GHG reductions.
   Alternatively, these benefits and more - reductions in poverty, and
   infant and maternal mortality by 50-75\%; increased access to safe water
   and sanitation; and universal literacy - can be obtained by broadly
   advancing sustainable economic development through policies,
   institutions and measures (such as those that would meet the UN
   Millennium Development Goals) at a cost approximating that of the Kyoto
   Protocol. However, in order to deal with climate change beyond the
   20852100 timeframe, the paper also recommends expanding research and
   development of mitigation options, reducing barriers to implementing
   such options, and active science and monitoring programs to provide
   early warning of any ``dangerous{''} climate change impacts.},

Abstract = {Climate warming due to human activities will be accompanied by
   hydrological cycle changes. Economies, societies and ecosystems in South
   America are vulnerable to such water resource changes. Hence, water
   resource impact assessments for South America, and corresponding
   adaptation and mitigation policies, have attracted increased attention.
   However, substantial uncertainties remain in the current water resource
   assessments that are based on multiple coupled Atmosphere Ocean General
   Circulation models. This uncertainty varies from significant wetting to
   catastrophic drying. By applying a statistical method, we characterized
   the uncertainty and identified global-scale metrics for measuring the
   reliability of water resource assessments in South America. Here, we
   show that, although the ensemble mean assessment suggested wetting
   across most of South America, the observational constraints indicate a
   higher probability of drying in the Amazon basin. Thus, over-reliance on
   the consensus of models can lead to inappropriate decision making.},

Title = {Compact Development Policy and Urban Resilience: A Critical Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sustainable development and urban resilience are dominant urban planning
   paradigms that have become buzzwords in urban planning and policy
   domains over the past 2-3 decades. While these two paradigms have been
   analyzed and scrutinized in different studies, the interconnection
   between them in policy realms is understudied. Compact development
   policy is expected to contribute to a variety of sustainability goals.
   However, these goals' alignment with the principles and goals of urban
   resilience is under question. This research tries to shed some light on
   this issue. A critical review method is employed to understand how
   compactness as a sustainable urban development policy relates to
   different principles and dimensions of urban resilience. First, the
   conceptual and theoretical relationship between urban resilience and
   compact city is established. Next, the resulting framework is used to
   critically analyze 124 articles to understand how the compact city
   policy relates to urban resilience from different dimensions and
   principles. Densification and intensification, mixed land use and
   diversity, and spatial connectivity and public transportation are
   identified as principles of the compact city. Finally, the
   interconnection between compact city policy and urban resilience
   dimensions and principles is explored and assessed through examining the
   selected literature. The results of the review show some alignments
   between compact city policy outcomes and urban resilience. However, the
   level of alignment may vary depending on the context, scale, or
   dimension. In other words, while compact city in one scale/dimension can
   increase urban resilience to a specific adverse event or stressor, it
   might increase vulnerability to others in another scale/dimension. From
   the policy perspective, compact development policy and urban resilience
   principles should clearly be defined a priori to reach favorable
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Climate change effects have the potential of affecting both ocean and
   atmospheric processes. These changes pose serious threats to the
   millions of people that live by the coast. Thus, the objective of the
   present review is to discuss how climate change is altering (and will
   continue to alter) atmospheric and oceanic processes, what are the main
   implications of these alterations along the coastline, and which are the
   ecosystem-based management (EBM) strategies that have been proposed and
   applied to address these issues. While ocean warming, ocean
   acidification and increasing sea level have been more extensively
   studied, investigations on the effects of climate change to wind and
   wave climates are less frequent. Coastal ecosystems and their respective
   natural resources will respond differently according to location,
   environmental drivers and coastal processes. EBM strategies have mostly
   concentrated on improving ecosystem services, which can be used to
   assist in mitigating climate change effects. The main challenge for
   developing nations regards gaps in information and scarcity of
   resources. Thus, for effective management and adaptive EBM strategies to
   be developed worldwide, information at a local level is greatly needed.

Volume = {135},
Pages = {290-302},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vessel slowdown may be an alternative mitigation option in regions where
   re-routing shipping corridors to avoid important marine mammal habitat
   is not possible. We investigated the potential relief in masking in
   marine mammals and fish from a 10 knot speed reduction of container and
   cruise ships. The mitigation effect from slower vessels was not equal
   between ambient sound conditions, species or vessel-type. Under quiet
   ambient conditions, a speed reduction from 25 to 15 knots resulted in
   smaller listening space reductions by 16-23\%, 10-18\%, 1-2\%, 5-8\% and
   8\% respectively for belugas, bowheads, bearded seals, ringed seals, and
   fish, depending on vessel-type. However, under noisy conditions, those
   savings were between 9 and 19\% more, depending on the species. This was
   due to the differences in species' hearing sensitivities and the low
   ambient sound levels measured in the study region. Vessel slowdown could
   be an effective mitigation strategy for reducing masking.},

Title = {Mitigating the Urban Heat Island Effect in Megacity Tehran},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Cities demonstrate higher nocturnal temperatures than surrounding rural
   areas, which is called ``urban heat island{''} (UHI) effect. Climate
   change projections also indicate increase in the frequency and intensity
   of heat waves, which will intensify the UHI effect. As megacity Tehran
   is affected by severe heatwaves in summer, this study investigates its
   UHI characteristics and suggests some feasible mitigation strategies in
   order to reduce the air temperature and save energy. Temperature
   monitoring in Tehran shows clear evidence of the occurrence of the UHI
   effect, with a peak in July, where the urban area is circa 6K warmer
   than the surrounding areas. The mobile measurements show a park cool
   island of 6-7K in 2 central parks, which is also confirmed by satellite
   images. The effectiveness of three UHI mitigation strategies high albedo
   material (HAM), greenery on the surface and on the roofs (VEG), and a
   combination of them (HYBRID) has been studied using simulation with the
   microscale model ENVI-met. All three strategies show higher cooling
   effect in the daytime. The average nocturnal cooling effect of VEG and
   HYBRID (0.92, 1.10 K) is much higher than HAM (0.16K), although
   high-density trees show a negative effect on nocturnal cooling.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-265},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of `Sea Cities' to emphasize a range
   of tactics to acknowledge the relationship between the sea and cities.
   This concept is critical for the possibility of integrating future
   aquatic-based urbanism to address climate change, and in particular, the
   issue of rising sea levels, which is currently faced by the majority of
   coastal cities. We compare and assess the tactics of four sea cities
   (i.e., to fortify, accommodate, release, and floating) against the case
   study of Jakarta. Jakarta is deemed to be among the metropolitan cities
   most vulnerable to sea level rise, owing to overpopulation alongside the
   fact that its land is sinking rapidly due to massive urban development.
   In order to understand the prospects and pitfalls of each tactic for
   Jakarta, we analyse scholarly literature on the subject, official
   government reports and documents, as well as policy briefs released by
   governments at the national level. This study finds that massive hard
   structural solutions are not only insufficient but also ineffective
   towards solving the challenges of climate change in Jakarta, especially
   the rising sea level. At the same time, it also identifies that while
   the combination of accommodating and floating tactics has never been
   considered as future a planning option, this could enable more resilient
   and adaptive solutions for the future development trajectory of Jakarta.
   In doing so, it could also provide important transferrable lessons for
   other coastal cities, especially those within developing countries.},

Title = {When the ``Strong Arms{''} Leave the Farms-Migration, Gender Roles and
   Risk Reduction in Vietnam},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {For many family farms, migration is one strategy for reducing poverty
   and vulnerability to both natural hazards and economic risk. While more
   men typically migrate to work, the implications of this on the household
   are inconclusive, especially for the women who remain on the farms. This
   study employs a gender lens to examine the effects of economically
   driven migration on household decision-making, farm labor and disaster
   risk reduction, focusing on two disaster-prone regions with high poverty
   rates in Vietnam: Dien Bien (Northwest) and Ha Tinh (North Central
   Coast) provinces. Surveys of 228 households with at least one migrant
   worker showed a new generation of young male and female migrants, and
   that men over 30 years of age migrated for longer periods and more
   frequently than their spouses. Intrahousehold impacts differed according
   to risk strategies. In areas with a lower-risk coping strategy (Dien
   Bien), seasonal jobs coincided with periods of less intense farming
   activities. During the absence of male family members, women temporarily
   made more domestic decisions. In areas with a higher-risk adaptation
   strategy (Ha Tinh), farming was planned for longer absences; thus
   decisions remained largely unchanged. Remittances invested into
   agriculture contributed to shortening the recovery period after
   disasters and, in some cases, diversifying farming systems. The
   migrant's absence was offset by relatives and neighbors as essential
   labor reserves. New resilient farming systems need to be disaster proof,
   gender-sensitive and free up labor.},

Title = {Co-production of climate services: A story map for future coastal
   flooding for the city of Flensburg},
Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Story maps offer the possibility to visualise scientific information and
   climate data in an accessible format and, as web-based tools, reach a
   large audience. However, the use of story maps in the context of climate
   services has not yet been widely explored or implemented. In this study
   we present a story map for communicating the potential impacts of
   flooding due to sea-level rise for the city of Flensburg, situated at
   the German Baltic Sea coast. The map is developed in the form of a
   web-based tool and includes background information on sea-level rise and
   coastal flooding as well as on coastal adaptation measures; interactive
   maps with information on city landmarks; and maps of future flooding
   scenarios based on numerical modelling. To increase the usability of the
   climate service we have applied a co-production approach and
   collaborated with the general public to identify user needs in an
   iterative process. Our study highlights the user needs for detailed
   visualisation of potential flooding due to sea-level rise as well as for
   further information on adaptation measures. As a climate service, our
   story map serves as a starting point for raising awareness among the
   general public and for initiating action for adaptation to reduce
   vulnerability to coastal flooding in Flensburg.},

Abstract = {Target detection in sea clutter is a challenging problem in radar
   detection, specifically, when the Doppler return of the target and
   clutter are collocated. Polarization diverse radars provide additional
   information that enhances target detection. In this paper, we use an
   effective: independent component analysis (ICA) approach, adaptive
   complex maximization of non-Gaussianity (A-CMN) {[}1], to efficiently
   combine polarimetric radar data prior to detection. We show that A-CMN
   estimates the polarimetric scatter coefficients for the single target in
   clutter case, thereby providing matched-filter performance without the
   need for clutter or target models. The detection performance using ICA
   is evaluated with sea clutter collected with the McMaster IPIX radar off
   the coast of Canada {[}2]. We also demonstrates the ability of this
   approach to adapt to the changing sea clutter conditions using
   simulation results.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation: Is there a role for intervention research?},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {86-97},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While climate change will expose regions to similar impacts, the extent
   of those impacts and effective response at the local level will be
   determined not only by the location's sensitivity and vulnerability but
   also by local groups and individuals' capacity, including their
   institutional links, social networks and motivation to action. In
   parallel, scientific information and research plays a critical role in
   informing climate change adaptation by providing both an improved
   understanding of the actual climate risks and response alternatives.
   The paper focuses on two local-scale intervention research projects
   undertaken in urbanised coastal areas in Brazil and in Australia
   concentrated on improving the dialogue between `those who make science'
   and `those who use science to make decisions' in order to make climate
   science more useful, and creating purposeful collective action,
   respectively. A conceptual model is devised to investigate how
   intervention research could aid adaptive capacity by generating new
   knowledge and facilitating change towards climate change adaptation at
   the local level. Drawing on the findings, a framework is proposed to
   advance the role of intervention research in policy development for
   enhancing adaptive capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A new approach to simulating the urban environment with a mesocale model
   has been developed to identify efficient strategies for mitigating
   increases in surface air temperatures associated with the urban heat
   island (UHI). A key step in this process is to define a ``global''
   roughness for the cityscape and to use this roughness to diagnose 10-m
   temperature, moisture, and winds within an atmospheric model. This
   information is used to calculate local exchange coefficients for
   different city surface types (each with their own ``local roughness''
   lengths); each surface's energy balances, including surface air
   temperatures, humidity, and wind, are then readily obtained. The model
   was run for several summer days in 2001 for the New York City
   five-county area. The most effective strategy to reduce the surface
   radiometric and 2-m surface air temperatures was to increase the albedo
   of the city (impervious) surfaces. However, this caused increased
   thermal stress at street level, especially noontime thermal stress. As
   an alternative, the planting of trees reduced the UHI's adverse effects
   of high temperatures and also reduced noontime thermal stress on city
   residents (and would also have reduced cooling energy requirements of
   small structures). Taking these results together, the analysis suggests
   that the best mitigation strategy is planting trees at street level and
   increasing the reflectivity of roofs.},

Abstract = {Urban overheating represents an internationally acknowledged
   anthropogenic phenomenon related to climate change and to the massive
   shift of population worldwide toward urban areas, which are increasingly
   enlarging their size and density. The consequences of this urban warming
   (i.e., urban heat island) may compromise citizens' quality of life in
   urban areas, indoor and outdoor comfort perception, and building energy
   performance in summer conditions. In this panorama, this review presents
   recent contributions demonstrating the effectiveness and urgent need of
   existing mitigation strategies. The same strategies are also
   comparatively assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis demonstrating
   their effect with varying climate conditions and urban context. Results
   of existing studies, validated by the present assessment, aimed at
   quantitatively investigating the effect of mitigation strategies for
   reducing building cooling needs and enhancing urban well-being, thanks
   to international scientific effort carried out in the last decades. To
   this aim, the logical flow of the review deals with the main
   technologies for urban warming mitigation are described, together with
   the main findings of numerical and experimental research initiatives,
   demonstrating the field effect of improving pedestrians comfort and
   urban well-being all around the world. Then, the mitigation potential of
   key green, water and cool strategies is critically reviewed, and further
   scientific and implementation needs are discussed. All the reviewed
   contributions demonstrate an undeniable technology readiness level for
   their practical implementation and highlight the true necessity of a
   shared and synergistic policy effort worldwide.},

Title = {Risk assessment of coastal erosion for Odisha coast along Bay of Bengal,
   India using coastal hazard wheel model},
Journal = {GEOJOURNAL},
Abstract = {This paper makes an assessment of the coastal erosion hazard of the
   Odisha state with the use of `Coastal Hazard Wheel' methodology which is
   a multi-hazard assessment as well as a management tool in a changing
   global climate. This study analyses the coastal environment to assess
   the vulnerability profile of coastal erosion by using bio-geophysical
   parameters such as geological layout, tidal range, exposure to waves,
   balance or deficit of sediments, characteristics of flora and fauna and
   exposure to storm climate. These are also used in analysing climate
   change hazards of the coast which are inherent to an area like saline
   flooding, gradual inundation, ecosystem disruption and salt water
   intrusion. CHW framework has generated information about the degree to
   which coastal erosion is inherent in a particular coastal location along
   the coast. This application has used remote sensing data from the public
   domain and a GIS approach to screen the problem with an appropriate
   scale as suitable for regional and national planning purposes with a
   management perspective because of limited data availability. The study
   has generated coastal erosion data and maps for the 480 km of the
   coastline dividing the coast in to 14 different morphological segments.
   Assessment of this hazard shows that 50 percent of Odisha's coastline is
   vulnerable to a high or very high inherent hazard of erosion, 45 percent
   exhibits a lower level of erosion presence and 5 percent is moderately
   vulnerable to erosion. This study has revealed increasing magnitude of
   coastal erosion than previous assessments by different researchers which
   were mostly based on coastal vulnerability indices. The study also
   identifies a number of possible erosion hazard management and mitigation
   options which can be used depending on their location specific field
   data and coastal characteristics. The finding of the study is
   significant in view of its contribution towards a first step in
   understanding coastal erosion at the regional level for their
   management. However, input of local data and manmade structures along
   the coast in the model would enhance the results for the site-specific
   mitigation measures.},

Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {901-917},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Uncertainty and risk abound in making natural resource management
   decisions. Population viability analysis (PVA) includes a variety of
   qualitative or quantitative analyses to predict the future status of a
   population or collection of populations and to predict the risk of
   extinction (or quasi-extinction) over time given some assumptions of the
   factors driving population dynamics. In this paper, we review the
   various PVA models applied to Atlantic and Pacific salmon for
   determination of listing under the Endangered Species Act and in
   planning recovery actions. We also review the numerous cautions involved
   in developing PVA models and in interpreting their results. There have
   been a larger number of PVA models applied to Pacific salmon compared to
   Atlantic salmon due to the greater geographic range and number of
   species of Pacific salmon. Models for both Atlantic and Pacific salmon
   have ranged from simple models that view populations as simply a number
   of organisms to complex age- or stage-structured models depending on the
   purpose of the model and available data for model parameterization. The
   real value of PVA models to salmon conservation is not in making
   absolute predictions of the risk of extinction, but rather in evaluating
   relative effects of management alternatives on extinction risk and
   informing decision making within an adaptive management framework. As
   computing power, quantitative techniques, and knowledge of mechanistic
   linkages between terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments
   advance, PVA models will become an even more powerful tool in
   conservation planning for salmon species.},

Title = {Assessing integrated agricultural livelihood vulnerability to climate
   change in the coastal region of West Bengal: Implication for spatial
   adaptation planning},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Southeast Asia, the West Bengal coastal region is one of the
   significant hotspots of climate-induced vulnerability. This article
   defines vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and
   adaptive capacity. We selected 43 subcomponent indicators under nine
   major components for constructing the Integrated Agricultural Livelihood
   Vulnerability Index (IALVI). Understanding the spatial distribution of
   IALVI to climate change is vital to formulate proper sustainable
   adaptation strategies for the future. Results revealed that high to very
   high vulnerability in the south and southeastern coastal C.D. Blocks due
   to high exposure and high sensitivity and agricultural livelihood of
   5.02 million people were highly vulnerable to the adverse effect of
   climate change. On the contrary, moderate to low vulnerability is
   experienced in the western and northern parts of the region due to less
   exposure, less sensitivity, and high adaptive capacity. This study
   applies geospatial techniques and examines the spatial distribution of
   climate change vulnerability in the coastal region of West Bengal. The
   most vulnerable region in this study area comprises a gentle slope, low
   elevation, high drainage density, and poor socio-economic conditions.
   Consequently, several adaptation methods, such as a better cyclone
   shelter, embankments, a more robust transportation and communication
   system, and improved healthcare facilities, may help to raise the level
   of adaptive capacity in the vulnerable regions. These findings will be
   helpful for policymakers in formulating proper climate risk mitigation
   strategies in coastal West Bengal. To validate the secondary results
   primary investigation was also done in this study.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Coastal areas are threatened under climate change because of factors
   related to vulnerability of society and sensitivity of the environment.
   Protection and adaptation may mitigate the adverse consequences. This
   research reviews and assesses the options of protection by homeowners in
   the coastal zone in the southwest region of Cameroon. The coastal zone
   of Cameroon is studied because of the observed deleterious effect of
   recent extreme climatic events. From a research sample of 400
   households, the house types and protection strategies - which are of two
   main types: reactive measures and preventive measures taken to offset
   adverse effects on property, are studied. A multinomial logit function
   reveals that income, education, age and gender are significant factors
   determining household's probability on the selection of protection
   measures. The study concludes that there are strong implications for
   adaptation to future climate change, and the ability of homeowners to
   extensively respond will have to be reinforced not only by communal and
   public works projects but also through an active government policy to
   promote climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Mapping social vulnerability to natural hazards in Italy: A suitable
   tool for risk mitigation strategies},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {187-196},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Italy is one of the European countries that are most heavily exposed to
   a wide range of natural hazards, which might cause large economic
   losses. In this context, the assessment of social vulnerability has an
   important role for evaluating the capacity of a community to prepare
   for, respond to and recover from disasters. However there are currently
   no published studies analysing social vulnerability and its spatial
   distribution in Italy. Within this framework, this paper aims to apply a
   proven method for assessing social vulnerability at the national scale,
   while considering the contribution of the socioeconomic and demographic
   factors that affect the Italian population. The proposed methodology is
   based on the Hazard-of-Place Model approach, and uses free and open
   source software applications (FOSS). Specifically, we selected
   significant components through Principal Component Analysis and derived
   their spatial distribution. Using component scores, we derived a social
   vulnerability index, evaluated its geographic distribution, and
   performed a cluster analysis on its spatial variation. The analysis
   identified different spatial patterns across Italy, providing useful
   information for identifying the communities most likely to experience
   negative natural disaster impacts due to their socioeconomic and
   demographic characteristics. This research represents an important
   contribution to improve the potentiality of risk mitigation strategies
   and in designing risk custom-made policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Rediscovering the past to negotiate the future: How knowledge about
   settlement history on high tropical Pacific Islands might facilitate
   future relocations},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Livelihood challenges from future climate change confront coastal
   high-island communities in the Pacific; most are currently inadequately
   prepared. The sustained inability of external funding to bring about
   appropriate change, especially in rural communities, is well documented.
   As the situation, forced largely by accelerating sea-level rise, becomes
   more exigent, so effective and sustainable adaptation in such places is
   becoming an increasing priority.
   This study proposes that rather than preferencing science, something
   that leaders in many such communities value little, adaptive strategies
   should engage with community histories that have often been kept alive
   in such places by oral traditions (and other means) passed across many
   generations. On high Pacific islands, many people in pre-colonial times
   occupied inland places where their exposure to coastal change (and
   environmental shocks more generally) was negligible. For ease of
   accessibility and control, most Pacific communities were relocated to
   the coasts early in colonial times, establishing an orthodoxy of coastal
   living that prevailed after independence and today underpins the
   reluctance of many coastal dwellers to contemplate landward relocation.
   Understanding how people in this region lived in the (distant) past
   helps today's coastal peoples contextualize imperatives for relocation,
   both within and between islands. Together with developing adaptive
   strategies that are driven by communities rather than by outsiders
   (people without long-term vested interests in particular places), this
   seems likely to provide a blueprint for successful future relocations in
   the Pacific Islands, one in which there are specific roles for
   communities, governments and their international partners.},

Abstract = {Due to climate change effects, the EU is experiencing heavier rainfalls
   and storms and sea level rising, which resulted at local and regional
   level in an increasing intensity and frequency of flooding. Increasing
   territories resilience and mitigating hydrogeological risk have become,
   therefore, one of the greatest challenges that our society is facing
   today. In this context, the successfulness of public decision processes
   play a key role. Due to the dramatic complexity of these decision
   process, which involve different stakeholders and actors, whose stakes
   are high and who may have conflicting objectives, policy-makers and
   planners require robust, transparent and coherent decision tools to
   support them in pursuing their arduous task. In this paper, we propose a
   methodological approach, which aims at increasing legitimation,
   accountability and transparency in public decision-making related to
   prioritization of hydrogeological risk mitigation strategies, by
   creating consensus via a participative approach. In detail, we discuss
   the potential of absolute AHP models in the prioritization of
   hydrogeological risk mitigation strategies. We argue that, due to the
   specific characteristics of absolute AHP measurement, once the hierarchy
   of criteria has been set and weights have been determined, the absolute
   model can be implemented on any set of alternatives, which does not need
   to be defined a priori, but can evolve over time, thus accounting for
   changes in single-criterion valuation of alternatives, contingent to
   variations in boundary conditions of the decision environment.},

Title = {Impact of urban heat island mitigation measures on microclimate and
   pedestrian comfort in a dense urban district of Lebanon},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The interaction between microclimate and buildings is predominant in
   urban areas. Thus, the urbanization constitutes the main cause of UHI
   formation. During the last years, several studies exposed the critical
   effects of UHI in the Mediterranean climate. As a result, there is a
   need for sustainable systems and urban policies to reduce heat islands
   in urban areas. This paper aims to present the impact of some UHI
   mitigation strategies in a Mediterranean city, Beirut Lebanon. Numerical
   microclimate simulations of an existing Lebanese district of Dora in
   Beirut, are performed using ENVI-met software. The study focuses on the
   potential of UHI mitigation scenarios to create freshness in summer
   conditions. The strategies are based on the increase of green surfaces,
   on the installation of water spray and fountains, and on the increase of
   the albedo of the facades and roofs of the buildings. A focus is carried
   out on white models, dealing with the albedo modification of roads and
   buildings. The effect of the proposed strategies on the pedestrian
   comfort is also evaluated by using the physiologically equivalent
   temperature PET. Results pointed out that implementation of water
   features contributes to a significant reduction of ambient temperature
   reaching a maximum of 5 degrees C. In term of outdoor thermal comfort,
   the results showed the important role of green areas on the improvement
   of pedestrian comfort during daytime. Finally, this research supports a
   set of actions that could be helpful for urban designer to create cool
   islands in the Lebanese neighborhoods.},

Abstract = {Extensive geographic areas of the world show a long-term atmospheric
   moisture deficit. Desertification of Rajasthan is concurrent with the
   strengthened weather extremality and mean annual air temperature (MAAT)
   rise over the western part of the Indian subcontinent. The present
   landscape aridification due to the precipitation decrease and reinforced
   windiness generates surface-cover dryness, aeolian erosion with a mass
   sediment transfer, salinity of excessively irrigated lands and
   groundwater depletion; altogether these pose major geo-environmental
   threats and settlement risks of the expanding Thar Desert.
   Livestock-overgrazing of sparse-vegetation contributes to ecological
   pressure to the fragile wasteland ecosystems with approximately
   three-quarters of the countryside affected to a certain extent by
   degradation and >50\% exposed to wind erosion. Sand dune stabilisation
   by the drought-adapted tree plantation, the regional hydrology network
   regulation and the arid-land farming based on new xerophytic cultigens
   are the key land-use and mitigation strategies. Specific geomorphic
   palaeosettings predetermined patterned adaptive forms of the ancient
   desert inhabitation. Geo- and eco-tourism contributes to the arid-zone
   socioeconomic sustainability with regard to the rich natural and
   cultural heritage of the area. This study outlines the main effects of
   the current climate variations on the pristine and occupied lands of
   western Rajasthan, and the past and present relief transformations, and
   reviews the modern anthropogenic responses to desertification.},

Title = {A combined DPSIR and SAF approach for the adaptive management of beach
   erosion in Monte Hermoso and Pehuen Co (Argentina)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {143},

Pages = {63-73},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Coastal areas experience multiple pressures from anthropogenic
   activities that negatively change the ecological and environmental
   status of beaches and impact human welfare. The focus of this paper is
   coastal erosion, an issue that is very relevant for Argentina, the
   second largest nation in Latin America with an extensive coastline of
   nearly 5000 km. Coastal erosion decreases the attractiveness of coastal
   areas for tourism development, leading to considerable economic impacts.
   In this paper, two complementary approaches, the
   Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) and the Systems Approach
   Framework (SAF), were used to analyse two beach resorts in Argentina:
   Monte Hermoso and Pehuen Co. Application of the SAF included stakeholder
   mapping, governance (institutional) mapping and issue identification.
   During the participatory meetings with stakeholders and decision makers,
   the problem of coastal erosion was identified as the most important in
   the region. The joint approach of DPSIR and SAF contributed to: (i) the
   determination and description of the economic drivers of coastal
   erosion; (ii) the identification of the associated activities and
   pressures; (iii) the assessment of the ecological and environmental
   state of coastal areas; (iv) the assessment of impacts of environmental

Title = {Managed retreat and coastal climate change adaptation: The environmental
   justice implications and value of a coproduction approach},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Due to the effects of climate change, coastal areas and communities
   around the world will be increasingly impacted by diverse hazards
   including sea-level rise, flooding and eroding shorelines, leading to
   increasing displacement of people. Managed retreat is one potential
   adaptation strategy to proactively plan for large-scale climate-related
   displacements. There is, however, evidence that in many cases managed
   retreat has had problematic social impacts and that it has frequently
   been implemented through top-down models of planning. In response, this
   article reviews the literature on managed retreat to identify the
   limitations of current practices and the challenges for a more
   environmentally just approach. Based on this review, the article argues
   that a coproduction approach would provide a means to help address key
   planning challenges in this field. This involves collecting local
   knowledge of the risks posed by climate hazards and/or retreat, creating
   a connection between local knowledge and institutional mechanisms for
   supported relocation and facilitating community-led processes of retreat
   and redevelopment. The key contribution of the article is its analysis
   of the value of a coproduction approach from the perspective of
   achieving a more environmentally just approach to managed retreat.},

Title = {Climate velocity reveals increasing exposure of deep-ocean biodiversity
   to future warming},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},

Abstract = {Slower warming in the deep ocean encourages a perception that its
   biodiversity is less exposed to climate change than that of surface
   waters. We challenge this notion by analysing climate velocity, which
   provides expectations for species' range shifts. We find that
   contemporary (1955-2005) climate velocities are faster in the deep ocean
   than at the surface. Moreover, projected climate velocities in the
   future (2050-2100) are faster for all depth layers, except at the
   surface, under the most aggressive GHG mitigation pathway considered
   (representative concentration pathway, RCP 2.6). This suggests that
   while mitigation could limit climate change threats for surface
   biodiversity, deep-ocean biodiversity faces an unavoidable escalation in
   climate velocities, most prominently in the mesopelagic (200-1,000 m).
   To optimize opportunities for climate adaptation among deep-ocean
   communities, future open-ocean protected areas must be designed to
   retain species moving at different speeds at different depths under
   climate change while managing non-climate threats, such as fishing and
   mining.
   Marine biodiversity is at risk as the ocean warms, but currently the
   focus has been at the surface as the deep ocean has warmed less. Climate
   velocity-the speed and direction of isotherm displacement-is calculated
   to be faster in the deep ocean, and projections show this difference
   will grow.},
