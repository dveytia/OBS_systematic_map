Abstract = {That climate change is a major disruptor of rural livelihoods in the
   low- and middle-income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa, has been
   a key narrative for the continent's development for at least a decade.
   And while the severity of climate impacts on African development should
   not be underestimated, in this paper I argue that the vulnerability of
   smallholders in Sao Tome and Principe should be considered in the
   broader political economic and historical context of progressing
   depeasantisation and proletarianisation of global agricultural labour.
   Moreover, I posit that certain smallholders' vulnerability can actually
   increase as a result of both autonomous and externally planned
   adaptation strategies, the latter most commonly promoted by governments
   and their international development partners. To substantiate these
   arguments, the paper combines theoretical insights from labour geography
   and critical adaptation studies with ethnographic data collected in
   Liberdade - a village in the small island nation of Sao Tome and
   Principe - which participated in a nationwide climate change adaptation
   project. I trace local smallholders' vulnerability back to the country's
   political economic history and complement this by an investigation of
   the changing labour relations at the community level. Here, I analyse
   the autonomous adaptation strategies pursued by the residents and
   critically assess the localised effects of planned adaptation embodied
   by the project, with a specific focus on how they affect local labour
   relations. I conclude by providing some reflections on addressing the
   current pitfalls of planned adaptation.},

Title = {Social indicators of vulnerability for fishing communities in the
   Northern Gulf of California, Mexico: Implications for climate change},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Marine fisheries support the livelihoods of millions of people
   worldwide. These fisheries and the communities that depend on them are
   highly vulnerable to climate change and other interacting. anthropogenic
   threats. The cumulative and interacting effects of these stressors could
   potentially produce declines in fish production, which would
   significantly impact artisanal fishers. Assessing relative vulnerability
   of fishing communities to anthropogenic stressors is an important first
   step to identifying mitigation or adaptation strategies. This study
   assessed the vulnerability of 12 coastal communities in the Northern
   Gulf of California to disruptions in fishing activities from
   anthropogenic stressors, including climate change. The Northern Gulf is
   a megadiverse area and a major source of fishery resources. Quantitative
   indicator indices based on secondary and primary data were developed to
   assess the three aspects of vulnerability: sensitivity, exposure, and
   adaptive capacity. The key components of vulnerability varied amongst
   communities. Vulnerability was higher in communities with higher fishing
   dependence and lower socioeconomic diversification. The approach
   presented here provides important insights into the type of policy
   actions that might be needed in different communities for adaptation and
   mitigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {190},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate change impact on the environment makes the coastal areas
   vulnerable and demands the evaluation of such susceptibility. Historical
   changes in the shoreline positions and inundation based on projected
   sea-level scenarios of 0.5 and 1 m were assessed for Nagapattinam
   District, a low-lying coastal area in the southeast coast of India,
   using high-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data; multi-dated
   Landsat satellite images of 1978, 1991, 2003, and 2015; and census data
   of 2011. Image processing, geographical information system, and digital
   shoreline analysis system methods were used in the study. The shoreline
   variation indicated that erosion rate varied at different time scales.
   The end point rate indicated the highest mean erosion of - 3.12 m/year,
   occurred in 73\% of coast between 1978 and 1991. Weighted linear
   regression analysis revealed that the coast length of 83\% was under
   erosion at a mean rate of - 2.11 m/year from 1978 to 2015. Sea level
   rise (SLR) impact indicated that the coastal area of about 14,122 ha
   from 225 villages and 31,318 ha from 272 villages would be permanently
   inundated for the SLR of 0.5 and 1 m, respectively, which includes
   agriculture, mangroves, wetlands, aquaculture, and forest lands. The
   loss of coastal wetlands and its associated productivity will severely
   threaten more than half the coastal population. Adaptation measures in
   people participatory mode, integrated into coastal zone management with
   a focus on sub-regional coastal activities, are needed to respond to the
   consequences of climate change.},

Title = {Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) and

Journal = {DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {114},

Abstract = {Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) has for many years been considered
   one of the most important restraints to the production of salmonids in
   European aquaculture. In Norway, the disease is responsible for high
   losses in post-smolts in the first few weeks after sea transfer. Despite
   the importance of IPN, there are few epidemiological studies on risk
   factors and mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present analyses of
   data from all cohorts put to sea in 2009 to 2012 on Norwegian marine
   salmonid farms. The data used were obtained from national registers on
   salmonid production and disease outbreaks. The results showed that the
   risk of IPN outbreak was higher for spring versus autumn cohorts,
   Atlantic salmon versus rainbow trout and for cohorts on farms with
   previous history of IPN. The risk increased with increasing cohort size
   and infection pressure, whereas increasing temperature and weight at sea
   transfer decreased the risk. Estimations from a model of cumulative
   mortality within the first 6 mo after sea transfer showed that mortality
   in cohorts with IPN increased to approximately 7.2\% as compared to a
   `baseline' cohort with a mortality of 3.4\%. If the cohort had both IPN
   and pancreas disease (PD), the estimated mortality increased to 12.9\%,
   and cohorts with both IPN, PD and heart and skeletal muscle inflammation
   (HSMI) had an estimated mortality of 16.6\%, when all other significant
   factors were kept constant (these were cohort type, year, temperature at
   sea transfer and weight at sea transfer). Our results provide valuable
   inputs for mitigation strategies and for economic modelling of
   consequences of disease.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast has a long history of intense and varied
   development, from energy infrastructure and seaports to vacation homes
   and tourism. Coastal populations and development are growing.
   Concurrently, global climate change will influence sea level rise,
   resulting in increased flooding, storm surge, and coastal erosion.
   Regional planners must prepare for sea level rise and develop adaptive
   solutions to maximize resiliency. Comprehensive coastal vulnerability
   mapping assessments (CVMA) can integrate social, economic, and physical
   vulnerability with spatial analysis of natural hazards for local
   place-based investigations. Public Participation Geographic Information
   Systems (PPGIS) are a potentially important tool for the spatial
   collection of stakeholder knowledge for CVMA. The objective of this
   study was to assess the locations of a range of landscape values,
   ecosystem services, and development preferences held and identified by
   the general public using PPGIS to determine if those valued locations
   are vulnerable to sea level rise. We found that PPGIS can be used to map
   a wide variety of landscape values and that they can be used to assess
   vulnerability to sea level rise. We conclude with a discussion on how to
   integrate PPGIS into participatory CVMA for sea level rise planning.},

Abstract = {Climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity today, and
   discussions of its effects-from habitat loss to psychological
   impacts-can be found in most academic disciplines. Among the many
   casualties of contemporary climatic change is the archaeological
   heritage of Arctic and subarctic regions, as warming, erratic weather
   patterns, coastal erosion, and melting permafrost threaten the
   anthropogenic and ecological records found in northern environments.
   Archaeology is uniquely positioned to provide long-term perspectives on
   human responses to climatic shifts, and to inform on the current debate.
   In addition, the practice of archaeological research and assimilation of
   archaeological heritage into contemporary society can also address or
   even mitigate some of the sociocultural impacts of climate change.
   Focusing on the Yup'ik communities and critically endangered archaeology
   of the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta, Alaska, here we argue community
   archaeology can provide new contexts for encountering and documenting
   the past, and through this, reinforce cultural engagement and shared
   cultural resilience. We emphasize the benefits of archaeological
   heritage and the practice of archaeology in mitigating some of the
   social and psychological impacts of global climate change for
   communities as well as individuals. We also propose that archaeology can
   have a role in reducing psychological distance of climate change, an
   acknowledged barrier that limits climate change action, mitigation, and
   adaptation, particularly in regions where the impacts of contemporary
   climate change have not yet been immediately felt.},

Abstract = {Damietta harbor was constructed in 1982 at about 9.7km to the west of
   Damietta Nile branch. Its navigation channel is suffering from
   sedimentation causing hazardous for vessels, cargo ships,... etc, during
   their passage to and from the harbor. This is in addition to the high
   costs of periodic dredging operation. This paper presents the main
   findings of field studies carried out in the nearshore and offshore
   zones of the harbor. The monitoring results of this study indicate that
   the sedimentation processes is mainly controlled by waves, currents,
   configuration and shape of the shoreline and grain sorting processes.
   The navigation channel, 11km in length is acting as a sediment sink for
   sediments from different directions. Thus mitigation measure may be
   taken properly by elongating the two or one of the breakwaters to be
   submerged or emerged or dredge sand traps on both sides of the harbor to
   catch the sediments before reaching the navigation channel. The most
   efficient and optimum solution can be chosen after carrying out
   mathematical and /or physical model studies in addition to the economic
   one.},

Abstract = {IPCC AR4 reported that the emission of the anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide
   (CO2) increase the CO2 concentration in atmosphere after the Industrial
   Revolution, and increasing of CO2 concentration caused the global
   warming. Moreover, it is shown that CO2 dissolution into the ocean
   causes the acidification in the surface layer. The buffering effect of
   the ocean can suppress the change of the CO2 concentration in the
   atmosphere. However, the rise of the CO2 concentration in the ocean
   surface means the pH of seawater decreases. This phenomenon continues
   until the difference of CO2 partial pressure between the atmosphere and
   the ocean disappears if the emission of CO2 is stopped. But, the
   acidification of the ocean progresses as long as it keeps CO2 emission.
   It is feared that the ocean acidification has crises influence on
   various organisms and entire ocean ecosystem.
   Carbon Capture and Storage is one of the mitigation measure technologies
   of CO2 emission. Famous carbon storage technology of the CCS using ocean
   region is Sub-seabed Geological Storage and dilution type Ocean
   Sequestration. These CCS Technologies has been developed in RITE.
   Especially, Research and development project of ocean sequestration
   technology was established the core technologies for example CO2
   injection and dilution technology, prediction of drop and diluted CO2
   and evaluation methods of biological influence of CO2. These core
   technologies were enabled a feasibility study of Ocean Sequestration
   technology as total system. These studies showed constructions of ocean
   sequestration system, and estimated sequestration costs and additional
   CO2 amount. Furthermore, in this evaluation, the ocean sequestration
   system without the influence on the marine organism was shown by
   scientists of the Ocean Sequestration Project of Japan.
   This evaluation and comparison study for atmospheric CO2 decreasing
   measure and ocean acidification mitigation measure was based on above
   results, and it was carried out using three dimensional numerical model
   with ocean circulation model (MOM: Modular Ocean Model), global carbon
   cycle model based on a lower trophic ecosystem model and one box
   atmospheric model. And the several scenarios were selected for
   evaluation of CCS efficiency. These scenarios ware targeted over CO2
   emission based on S550 scenario and over emission were allocated to
   Geological Storage, Ocean Sequestration, other measure and no measure.
   Simulation results of Ocean Sequestration suggested efficiency for
   mitigation measure of increase atmospheric CO2 and Ocean Acidification.
   However, it was shown that the effect was different according to the
   ocean. Results of the simulation study showed ``Geological storage
   without leakage is the best as the effect of measures{''}. And it is
   suggested that ``There is a possibility of suppressing the ocean surface
   acidification to more effective by combining dilution type ocean
   sequestration with sub-seabed geological storage{''}. The effectiveness
   of ocean sequestration and geological storage was shown to some degree
   by this research. It is necessary to re-examine the use of the ocean
   model of a high resolution and the emission scenario of CO2, and to show
   the result with higher reliability.},

Title = {A mechanistic assessment of urban heat island intensities and drivers
   across climates},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The urban heat island effect (UHI) has been widely observed globally,
   causing climate, health, and energy impacts in cities. The UHI
   intensities have been found to largely depend on background climate and
   the properties of the urban fabric. Yet, a complete
   mechanisticunderstanding of how UHIs develop at a global scale is still
   missing. Using an urban ecohydrological and land-surface model (urban
   TethysChloris) in combination with multi-source remote sensing data, we
   performed simulations for 49 large urban clusters across the Northern
   Hemisphere in 2009-2019 and analysed how surface and canopy air UHIs
   (SUHI and CUHI, respectively) develop during day and night. Biophysical
   drivers triggering the development of SUHIs and CUHIs have similar
   dependencies on background climate, but with different magnitudes. In
   humid regions daytime UHIs can be largely explained by the urban-rural
   difference in evapotranspiration, whereas heat convection and conduction
   are important in arid areas. Plant irrigation can largely promote
   daytime urban evapotranspiration only in arid and semi-arid
   climates.During night, heat conduction from the urban fabric to the
   environment creates large UHIs mostly in warm arid regions. Overall,
   this study presents a mechanistic quantification of how UHIs develop
   worldwide and proposes viable solutions for sustainable
   climate-sensitive mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Flood Protection in Venice under Conditions of Sea-Level Rise: An
   Analysis of Institutional and Technical Measures},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {355-380},
Abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that in times of climate change loss of
   coastal resources and risk for human life can be minimized by
   implementing adaptation strategies. Such strategies need to encompass a
   balanced mix of non-structural (institutional) and structural
   (technical) measures based on sound scientific knowledge. This article
   discusses measures carried out to protect the city of Venice, Italy from
   flooding (locally known as ``high water{''}), and reflects on their
   ability to anticipate a possible acceleration of sea-level rise as
   induced by climate change. It is based on scientific literature,
   legislative and policy documents of key institutions, reports and
   documents of organizations working on Venice issues, newspaper articles,
   and interviews. Our analysis shows that the synergic action of the
   hydraulic defense infrastructure under construction is in principle
   adequate to withstand a broad range of sea-level rise scenarios for the
   next 100 years. However, when the goal is to use these investments
   effectively major changes in the existing institutional arrangements
   will be required in the years to come. The Venice findings point out the
   difficulties and yet the importance of identifying and implementing both
   non-structural and structural measures to adapt to climate change.},

Title = {An assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation for the Torres
   Strait Islands, Australia},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {405-433},

Abstract = {Adaptive practices are taking place in a range of sectors and regions in
   Australia in response to existing climate impacts, and in anticipation
   of future unavoidable impacts. For a rich economy such as Australia's,
   the majority of human systems have considerable adaptive capacity.
   However, the impacts on human systems at the intra-nation level are not
   homogenous due to their differing levels of exposure, sensitivity and
   capacity to adapt to climate change. Despite past resilience to changing
   climates, many Indigenous communities located in remote areas are
   currently identified as highly vulnerable to climate impacts due to
   their high level of exposure and sensitivity, but low capacity to adapt.
   In particular, communities located on low-lying islands have particular
   vulnerability to sea level rise and increasingly intense storm surges
   caused by more extreme weather. Several Torres Strait Island community
   leaders have been increasingly concerned about these issues, and the
   ongoing risks to these communities' health and well-being posed by
   direct and indirect climate impacts. A government agency is beginning to
   develop short-term and long-term adaptation plans for the region. This
   work, however, is being developed without adequate scientific assessment
   of likely `climate changed futures.' This is because the role that
   anthropogenic climate change has played, or will play, on extreme
   weather events for this region is not currently clear. This paper draws
   together regional climate data to enable a more accurate assessment of
   the islands' exposure to climate impacts. Understanding the level of
   exposure and uncertainty around specific impacts is vital to gauge the
   nature of these islands' vulnerability, in so doing, to inform decisions
   about how best to develop anticipatory adaptation strategies over
   various time horizons, and to address islanders' concerns about the
   likely resilience and viability of their communities in the longer term.},

Abstract = {It is possible that climatic change may stimulate population movements
   as people turn to migration as one strategy of adaptation. This paper
   attempts to assess possible migration flows which may occur, in response
   to climatic shifts over the next thirty years, from small island states
   in the south-west Pacific ocean region to the United States, Australia
   and New Zealand. It is argued that the small island states appear
   vulnerable to climatic change, with low coral atolls being most at risk.
   Adverse impacts of climatic change will be one extra pressure on small
   island states, many of which are already struggling to cope with
   sustainable management of their natural resources and with the demands
   of their rapidly growing populations for education, housing and
   employment. The migration strategy is likely to entail significant
   medium-term health, psychological and social costs for some Pacific
   island migrants as they try to move or cope with life in western
   industrialised societies.},

Abstract = {The focus of this investigation was the impact of predicted sea level
   rise on the road transportation network of the eThekwini Municipality,
   South Africa. The main objective was to identify the areas within the
   municipality which are most vulnerable to sea level rise and to develop
   adaptive responses and interventions in order to maintain road
   functionality. For the identification of the most vulnerable areas a
   multi-criteria analysis supported by geographical information system
   modelling was used. Three areas were identified, namely, the Isipingo,
   Bayhead and the Umgeni mouth areas. Adaptive road responses have been
   researched by employing a network analysis of each of the areas
   identified. Parameters modelled were traffic volume changes, travel time
   and volume to capacity ratio for the main roads in the areas identified.
   The adaptive responses required for each area were found to be
   different, varying from the addition of a lane to changes in signal
   settings. Overall this study presents a model of how vulnerability and
   the development of adaptive strategies to sea level rise could be
   addressed by municipalities.},

Title = {Assessment of urban surface and canopy cooling strategies in high-rise
   residential communities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {288},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Increased artificial constructions due to urbanization absorb more solar
   radiation, making urban surface and air temperatures rise and affecting
   the energy performance of urban buildings and the human health. Many
   studies have reported that green facades and roofs, materials with high
   albedos can noticeably reduce building surface temperatures and cool the
   air in summer. However, little is known about the cooling effects and
   assessment of different mitigation strategies when they are adopted in a
   block scale. This study focuses on assessing and comparing the effects
   in the high-rise communities in Xi'an, China, which are a good
   representation of the city because they are composed of a high density
   of buildings, and they cover the majority of the current urban sprawl
   land. Simulations of three community prototypes through ENVI-met
   software were carried out in order to assess the mitigation techniques
   in terms of the ground surface, building surface, and vertical canopy
   air temperature decrease. The main techniques adopted were cool
   pavements, cool coating facades and roofs, green facades with ivy and
   green roofs with funkia and 15 cm substrates, and combinations of those.
   The statistical analysis results revealed that green roof can cool the
   roof more than the cool roof, while cool facade can cool the facade more
   than green facade. As to single mitigation strategy, the cool pavement
   have the most significant potential to decrease canopy air temperature.
   In general, the combination of different strategies had much more
   positive effects than single solution. These positive results indicate
   that the cooling strategies are urgently needed in the current urban
   construction to alleviate the urban heat island effect. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Climate change impacts on African human settlements arise from a number
   of climate change-related causes, notably sea level changes, impacts on
   water resources, extreme weather events, food security, increased health
   risks from vector borne diseases, and temperature-related morbidity in
   urban environments.
   Some coastlines and river deltas of Africa have densely populated
   low-lying areas, which would be affected by a rise in sea level. Other
   coastal settlements will be subjected to increased coastal erosion.
   Recent flooding in East Africa highlighted the vulnerability of flood
   plain settlements and the need to develop adaptive strategies for
   extreme weather events management and mitigation. In the semi arid and
   arid zones many settlements are associated with inland drainage water
   sources. Increases in drought will enhance water supply related
   vulnerabilities. Inter-basin and international water transfers raise the
   need for adequate legal frameworks that ensure equity among
   participating nations.
   Similarly, water supply and irrigation reservoirs in seasonal river
   catchments might fail, leading to poor sanitation in urban areas as well
   as food shortage. Hydroelectric power generation could be restricted in
   drought periods, and where it is a major contributor to the energy
   budget, reduced power generation could lead to a multiplicity of other
   impacts. States are advised to develop other sources of renewable
   energy.
   Temperature changes will lead to altered distribution of disease vectors
   such as mosquitoes, making settlements currently free of vector borne
   diseases vulnerable. Rapid breeding of the housefly could create a
   menace associated with enteric disorders, especially in conditions of
   poor sanitation.
   The dry savannahs of Africa are projected as possible future food
   deficit areas. Recurrent crop failures would lead to transmigration into
   urban areas. Pastoralists are likely to undertake more trans-boundary
   migrations and probably come into conflict with settled communities.
   Adaptive measures will involve methods of coastal defences (where
   applicable), a critical review of the energy sector, both regionally and
   nationally, a rigorous adherence to city hygiene procedures, an informed
   agricultural industry that is capable of adapting to changing climate in
   terms of cropping strategies, and innovations in environment design to
   maximise human comfort at minimum energy expenditure. In the savannah
   and arid areas water resource management systems will be needed to
   optimise water resource use and interstate co-operation where such
   resources are shared.
   Climate change issues discussed here raise the need for state support
   for more research and education in impacts of climate change on human
   settlements in Africa.},

Title = {Assessing the sustainability of local resilience practices against sea
   level rise impacts on the lower Niger delta},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {221-228},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Response strategies determine the resilience of an area to effects of
   sea level rise. Strategies that are sustainable are those that do not
   negatively affect the environment, biodiversity and community life of
   the people. The paper discusses response strategies practiced in the
   Niger delta to combat effects of sea level rise like: flooding, erosion,
   inundation, storm surge, and intrusion of sea salt. Local responses to
   these natural hazards and the degree of effectiveness of the methods in
   enabling the people return to their normal lives are reviewed for their
   suitability as future adaptation strategies. GIS and remote sensing
   analysis of slope and topography show the Niger delta is vulnerable to
   further flooding, inundation, and erosion as a result of sea level rise.
   Based on a `business as usual' scenario, the GIS based bathtub approach
   is used to calculate and map possible inundation extents for the Niger
   delta under sea level rise conditions. As the Niger delta is subsiding
   due to oil and gas exploitation, relative sea level rise (RSLR) values
   for the Niger delta are obtained by adding measured subsidence values (7
   mm and 25 mm) to predicted eustatic sea level rise values (19 mm by 2030
   and 35 mm by 2050); resulting in RSLR of 0.14 0.96 m by 2030 and 2050.
   With subsidence at 7 mm/year and a RSLR of 0.14 m, results for 2030
   shows an inundation extent of 11193 km(2) which is 4.6\% of the total
   surface area; subsidence of 25 mm/year (SLR = 0.44 m) gives an
   inundation extent of 1254.0 km(2) which is 5.2\% of the surface area.
   Results for 2050 show that a rise of 0.29 rn (subsidence = 7 mm/year)
   will cause an inundation extent of 1175.9 km(2) which is 4.9\% of the
   total surface area, and RSLR of 0.96 m (subsidence = 25 mm/year)
   inundates 1633.0 km(2) which is 6.8\% of the surface area. Although the
   literature shows local practices have helped people to cope with the
   challenges posed by flooding, erosion, inundation, and inland intrusion
   of sea salts, however some of the practices have disadvantages that make
   them undesirable for inclusion in future planning. Sustainable local
   practices in the Niger delta include: planting of Bamboo trees for
   erosion control, use of sandbags as bridges and dikes (flood control),
   use of flood receptor pits as temporary flood water reservoirs, and
   community legislation against sand mining and indiscriminate tree
   felling. Further studies on the limitations of the local resilience
   practices in the Niger delta is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In terms of the importance of Egypt's natural resources, the prominence
   of minimizing the risks and the significance of taking an action to
   adapt to climate change, a multi-criterion analysis (i.e. in ranking the
   effectiveness of adaptation strategy) was proposed and implemented. The
   strategy is fuzzy decision making technique (FDMT). Primarily, the
   literature was reviewed. A study area was chosen. The impact of sea
   level rise was investigated. The vulnerability and adaptation of the
   study area was examined. The vulnerability index of the Nile Delta was
   investigated. The vulnerability indicators of the study area were
   examined. The available techniques were investigated and the FDMT was
   chosen to be incorporated to the study area. The FDMT was studied and
   applied to the Nile Delta. It was found that this technique is suitable
   in evaluating situations that deal with ambiguity and vagueness, involve
   subjectivity, and imprecise information. It was thus concluded that
   fuzzy decision making technique enables maximum benefit from practical
   know-how as it takes into account several variables and it could perform
   ``weighted merging'' to influencing variables. (C) 2015 Faculty of

Abstract = {Climate change will have a significant impact on coastal locations,
   affecting visitors' and residents' values and experiences. Yet, we know
   little about the ways visitors value the coast and how they may be
   affected by climate change impacts. There is a need for place-based
   studies, where residents and visitors are studied alongside one another
   to inform more comprehensive and socially-inclusive adaptation
   strategies. This study sought to understand the lived and landscape
   values that visitors and residents attribute to the natural reserves and
   beach of the Llobregat Delta in the densely built-up environment of
   Barcelona, Spain, as well as their concerns about the impacts of climate
   change. Results of our survey (n = 133) showed that residents and
   visitors alike highly valued the natural environment, biodiversity and
   therapeutic aspects. Residents placed more importance on the
   biodiversity, safety and sense of identity and pride that the area
   provides. Visitors were just as likely as residents to be concerned
   about the effects of climate change on the region. This concern reveals
   that visitors are key stakeholders with coastal place attachments that
   need to be integrated into future adaptation research and practice.},

Title = {Advancement in Urban Climate Modelling at Local Scale: Urban Heat Island
   Mitigation and Building Cooling Demand},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As cities and their population are subjected to climate change and urban
   heat islands, it is paramount to have the means to understand the local
   urban climate and propose mitigation measures, especially at
   neighbourhood, local and building scales. A framework is presented,
   where the urban climate is studied by coupling a meteorological model to
   a building-resolved local urban climate model, and where an urban
   climate model is coupled to a building energy simulation model. The
   urban climate model allows for studies at local scale, combining
   modelling of wind and buoyancy with computational fluid dynamics,
   radiative exchange and heat and mass transport in porous materials
   including evaporative cooling at street canyon and neighbourhood scale.
   This coupled model takes into account the hygrothermal behaviour of
   porous materials and vegetation subjected to variations of wetting, sun,
   wind, humidity and temperature. The model is driven by climate
   predictions from a mesoscale meteorological model including urban
   parametrisation. Building energy demand, such as cooling demand during
   heat waves, can be evaluated. This integrated approach not only allows
   for the design of adapted buildings, but also urban environments that
   can mitigate the negative effects of future climate change and increased
   urban heat islands. Mitigation solutions for urban heat island effect
   and heat waves, including vegetation, evaporative cooling pavements and
   neighbourhood morphology, are assessed in terms of pedestrian comfort
   and building (cooling) energy consumption.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1032-1050},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Resilience is the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to
   changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from
   disruptions. Methods and tools to quantify resilience are needed to
   provide actionable intelligence to plan, design, construct, and manage
   coastal systems. This paper describes how a probabilistic measure of
   resilience can be assessed for a coastal community using a Bayesian
   network. The measure of resilience is the joint probability of meeting
   two management objectives, one with respect to the level of system
   performance and the other with respect to the length of time required to
   restore system performance. This paper describes a pilot study to
   demonstrate the approach in Jamaica Bay, New York, a dense, urban,
   residential community located on the southern coast of Long Island.
   Results of the pilot study illustrate how practical information can be
   developed to support decisions about managing coastal systems. The pilot
   study provides insights into data and information requirements; the
   advantages, challenges, and limitations of the approach; and the
   feasibility of implementing this approach for operations. This approach
   to resilience assessment is well suited for coastal planning contexts
   because it explicitly incorporates information about uncertainty in the
   severity of coastal storm events, as well as uncertainty in how the
   system will perform when exposed to storm loads. The method challenges
   the community to establish explicit objectives for coastal resilience,
   identifies what data are needed to monitor progress toward objectives,
   and provides a platform from which to explore how those objectives might
   be achieved in practice.},

Title = {Benefits of mitigation of climate change for coastal areas},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {229-244},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper considers the possible benefits of mitigation of climate
   change for coastal areas with a strong emphasis on sea-level rise as
   this is one of the most certain consequences of human-induced global
   warming. There is a long-term `commitment to sea-level rise' due to the
   long thermal lags of the ocean system and hence the response of
   sea-level rise to mitigation is slower than for other climate factors.
   Therefore, while climate stabilisation reduces coastal impacts during
   the 21st century, compared to unmitigated emissions, the largest
   benefits may occur in the 22nd century (and beyond). The results of the
   analysis suggest that a mixture of adaptation and mitigation policies
   need to be considered for coastal areas, as this will provide a more
   robust response to human-induced climate change than either policy in
   isolation. This requires the joint evaluation of mitigation and
   adaptation in coastal areas, ideally using a probabilistic risk-based

Title = {Sea level rise, drought and the decline of Spartina patens in New
   England marshes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {196},
Pages = {173-181},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Already heavily impacted by coastal development, estuarine vegetated
   habitats (seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves) are increasingly
   affected by climate change via accelerated sea level rise, changes in
   the frequency and intensity of precipitation and storms, and warmer
   ocean temperatures. Conservation of these sensitive and vulnerable
   habitats requires the recognition of climate change effects so
   environmental managers can develop and apply appropriate intervention
   and adaptation strategies where possible. Here we focus on Spartina
   patens (saltmeadow cordgrass), a foundation species of New England (USA)
   coastal marshes. A growing, body of evidence suggests this species is
   disappearing rapidly from wetlands in the region, leading to reductions
   in habitat quality, plant diversity, carbon sequestration, erosion
   resistance and coastal protection. We grew S. patens under five
   inundation and three precipitation regimes, monitored changes in its
   extent within two Southern New England coastal marshes (2000-2014), and
   used water level and precipitation data to detect changes in
   environmental conditions affecting these marshes. Our results suggest
   that current inundation patterns have reduced the persistence of S.
   patens, while short-term drought did not appear responsible for
   vegetation changes or habitat conversion. We conclude that accelerated
   sea level rise is incompatible with the long-term survival of S. patens
   within the current landscape footprint of Southern New England's coastal
   wetlands. We suggest that conservation actions focused on high marsh
   preservation concentrate on facilitating the process of marsh migration
   onto uplands by prioritizing buffer conservation, conducting barrier
   removal and allowing for retreat where feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Biophysical indicators and Indigenous and Local Knowledge reveal
   climatic and ecological shifts with implications for Arctic Char
   fisheries},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Managing Arctic marine resources to be resilient to environmental
   changes requires knowledge of how climate change is affecting marine
   food webs and fisheries. Changes to fishery resources will have major
   implications for coastal Indigenous communities whose livelihoods,
   health, and cultures are strongly connected to fisheries. Understanding
   these broad social-ecological changes requires a transdisciplinary
   approach bringing together contrasting and complementary disciplines and
   ways of knowing. Here, we examine climatic proxies, ecological, and
   fishery indicators (stable isotopes, fish condition, and lipid content),
   and interviews with Inuit fishers to assess how marine ecosystem changes
   have influenced Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) ecology and fisheries
   over a 30-year time period (1987-2016) in the Kitikmeot region of the
   Canadian Arctic. Inuit fishers reported several observations of
   environmental changes, including longer ice-free seasons, warmer ocean
   temperatures, and the arrival of new marine species. Biophysical data
   revealed important changes toward earlier dates of ice breakup (>12 days
   in some areas) and a shift in isotopic niche reflecting a changing
   Arctic Char diet, with increased contribution of pelagic carbon and
   higher trophic level prey. Fish condition was improved in years with
   earlier ice breakup, as observed by both Inuit fishers and biophysical
   indicators, while lipid content increased through time, suggesting that
   longer ice-free seasons may have a positive effect on Arctic Char
   quality as reflected by both fish condition and lipid content. Long-term
   impacts of continuing climate change, however, such as the northward
   expansion of boreal species and increasing ocean temperatures, could
   have negative effects on fisheries (e. g., physiological impairment in
   fish if temperatures exceed their thermal range). Continuous
   community-based monitoring that directly informs fisheries management
   could help communities and managers adaptively, and sustainably, manage
   in the face of multiple interacting changes in Arctic marine systems.},

Title = {Adaptive strategies of Zostera japonica photosynthetic electron
   transport in response to thermal stress},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {164},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Seawater warming is emerging as a result of increasing global
   temperature. In this study, Zostera japonica (Ascherson and Graebner)
   collected from the intertidal zones of Changdao (37 degrees N, 120
   degrees E) were used to investigate the responses of photosynthetic
   electron transport to thermal exposure in April 2016. As seawater
   temperature rose from 20 to 32 degrees C, increases of the relative
   variable fluorescence at the K-step to the amplitude of F-J-F-o (W-k)
   and the maximum photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) indicated inhibition
   of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and photosystem II (PSII) reaction
   centers, respectively. When exposed to 32 degrees C for 4 h, both OEC
   and PSII reaction centers suffered irreversible damage, confirming that
   32 degrees C is the upper critical seawater temperature for Z. japonica
   photosynthetic electron transport. As a thermal inhibition indicator,
   PIabs exhibited a time-dependent linear decrease, with irreversible
   damage of the PSII reaction center occurring once the value of PIabs
   dropped below 10.60. Based on results of the photosynthetic performance,
   thermal response strategies were summarized as: (1) an enhancement in
   the efficiency of the active PSII reaction centers; (2) an increase in
   the activity of the PSII electron acceptor side; (3) an enhancement in
   the activities of both PSI and the cyclic electron transport around PSI;
   (4) the alternation between PSII and PSI. Such adaptive strategies may
   balance the redox state of electron transport and regulate the
   distribution of excitation energy between the two photosystems, thereby
   protecting Z. japonica from ocean warming.},

Title = {Effects of Densification on Urban Microclimate-A Case Study for the City
   of Vienna},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate adaptation, mitigation, and protecting strategies are becoming
   even more important as climate change is intensifying. The impacts of
   climate change are especially tangible in dense urban areas due to the
   inherent characteristics of urban structure and materiality. To assess
   impacts of densification on urban climate and potential adaptation
   strategies a densely populated Viennese district was modeled as a
   typical sample area for the city of Vienna. The case study analyzed the
   large-scale densification potential and its potential effects on
   microclimate, air flow, comfort, and energy demand by developing 3D
   models of the area showing the base case and densification scenarios.
   Three methods were deployed to assess the impact of urban densification:
   Micro-climate analysis (1) explored urban heat island phenomena, wind
   pattern analysis (2) investigated ventilation and wind comfort at street
   level, and energy and indoor climate comfort analysis (3) compared
   construction types and greening scenarios and analyzed their impact on
   the energy demand and indoor temperatures. Densification has negative
   impacts on urban microclimates because of reducing wind speeds and thus
   weakening ventilation of street canyons, as well as accelerating heat
   island effects and associated impact on the buildings. However,
   densification also has daytime cooling effects because of larger shaded
   areas. On buildings, densification may have negative effects especially
   in the new upper, sun-exposed floors. Construction material has less
   impact than glazing area and rooftop greening. Regarding adaptation to
   climate change, the impacts of street greening, green facades, and green
   roofs were simulated: The 24-h average mean radiant temperature (MRT) at
   street level can be reduced by up to 15 K during daytime. At night there
   is only a slight reduction by a few tenths of 1 K MRT. Green facades
   have a similar effect on MRT reduction, while green roofs show only a
   slight reduction by a few tenths of 1 K MRT on street level. The results
   show that if appropriate measures were applied, negative effects of
   densification could be reduced, and positive effects could be achieved.},

Abstract = {Food security depends on the ability of staple crops to tolerate new
   abiotic and biotic pressures. Wheat, barley, and other small grains face
   substantial yield losses under all climate change scenarios. Intra-plot
   diversification is an important strategy for smallholder farmers to
   mitigate losses due to variable environmental conditions. While this
   commonly involves sowing polycultures of distinct species from different
   botanical families in the same field or multiple varieties of the same
   species (varietal mixtures), mixed plantings of multiple species from
   the same family are less well known. However, the sowing of maslins, or
   cereal species mixtures, was formerly widespread in Eurasia and Northern
   Africa and continues to be employed by smallholder farmers in the
   Caucasus, Greek Islands, and the Horn of Africa, where they may
   represent a risk management strategy for climate variability. Here, we
   review ethnohistorical, agronomic, and ecological literature on maslins
   with a focus on climate change adaptation, including two case studies
   from Ethiopian smallholder farmers. The major points are the following:
   (1) farmers in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Georgia report that mixtures are a
   strategy for ensuring some yield under unpredictable precipitation and
   on marginal soils; (2) experimental trials support these observations,
   demonstrating increased yield advantage and stability under certain
   conditions, making maslins a potentially adaptive practice when crops
   are impacted by new biotic and abiotic conditions due to climate change;
   (3) maslins may balance trade-offs between interfamilial species
   plantings and varietal mixtures, and expand the total portfolio of
   traits available for formulating mixtures from varietal mixtures alone;
   and (4) they may buffer against the impacts of climate trends through
   passive shifts in species composition in response to environmental
   pressures. We demonstrate the potential benefits of maslins as an
   agroecological intensification and climate adaptation strategy and lay
   out the next steps and outstanding questions regarding the applicability
   of these cropping systems.},

   Attaining this goal will require strong policies and public support. In
   this study, a psychological model was tested to predict how Taiwanese

   change. The model is an expansion of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT

   subjective effectiveness of alternative solutions (SEAS) as additional
   variables. Data were collected after conducting two surveys in Taiwan
   that involved a total of 394 respondents. The results indicated that
   perceived responsibility and SEAS predicted the support of only one to
   three of the policies. Regarding the PMT variables, severity and
   vulnerability did not affect the support of almost all policies. Policy
   support was primarily affected by the other three PMT variables:
   self-efficacy, response efficacy, and relative benefit. These three
   variables significantly affected most policies, accounting for 34-73\%
   of the variance in public support. This suggests that PMT facilitates
   understanding of public support for climate policies.},

Volume = {129},
Pages = {16-26},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Transitioning to sustainability will require innovation, not just in
   technological and economic terms but also in governance and culture. The
   work presented here sought a remote, vulnerable island context (Fiji,
   South Pacific) to enable further insight into the innovation process
   related to resilience and sustainability. The innovation targeted by
   this work was off-grid solar renewable energy (RE) systems framed as a
   development instrument to promote local, community-based resilience to
   climate change through increased livelihood security and reduction of
   climate change effects. Applying a local-level resilience framework to
   solar technology use, we conclude that the RE system can improve
   resilience, however, unintended consequences included a rush for energy
   usage causing a ``tragedy of commons{''} of finite stored energy and
   subsequently increased supplementary fossil fuel use. This suggests that
   there are still missed resilience opportunities in the way that the
   innovation is implemented in developing countries and remote areas in
   particular. Further analysis demonstrated that improved planning at the
   socio-technological interface has the potential to strengthen
   communities' resilience. With significant RE investments required for a
   transition to a low-carbon future in many developing countries, there is
   a pressing need to effectively introduce innovative uses of
   technologies. Existential threats to many local communities, and some
   nations in the Pacific may mean that sub-optimal innovation will not be
   enough.},

Title = {Identification of the key landscape metrics indicating regional
   temperature at different spatial scales and vegetation transpiration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Land use changes are widely known as one of the drivers of land surface
   temperature variation. However, the influence of composition of various
   land use types and their configuration, i.e. landscape pattern, on
   regional temperature is still unknown. We test the hypotheses: (1)
   surface air temperature would vary according to landscape pattern, and
   (2) these effects would vary, demonstrating scale- and site-dependence
   effects through different vegetation transpiration rates. The
   relationships of 360 landscape metrics, indicating multiple dimensions
   of landscape pattern, and regional temperature at five climatic zones at
   five spatial scales in southern hilly China were examined through
   Pearson correlation analysis, stepwise regression and redundancy
   analysis. The area and number of grassland, building, and dry cropland
   patches are positively correlated with temperature; the area and density
   of forestland, shrubland, wet cropland, and water patches have cooling
   effects. The optimal scale and landscape metrics are also different
   between different climate zones. Landscape-level vegetation
   transpiration, determined by the dominant species, may partially explain
   why landscape pattern affects regional temperature. These findings
   provide new insights for understanding land use-temperature interactions
   and designing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Suitable
   landscape pattern, optimal scale, and dominant species should be
   considered in landscape planning and land use management to mitigate the
   impacts of the projected climatic warming.},

Title = {Unavoidable solutions for coastal adaptation in Reunion Island (Indian
   Ocean)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {393-400},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The study of recent past trajectories of vulnerability to
   climate-related hazards allows for highlighting the prevailing
   environmental and anthropogenic drivers that operated over the last
   fifty to sixty years and given latency phenomena in social systems,
   therefore have the potential to continue driving a system's
   vulnerability in the coming decades. Stop or even reverse these trends
   represents as much unavoidable solutions for enhancing concrete
   long-term adaptation to climate change, whatever the end-century warming
   scenario.
   Using the case study of Reunion Island (Indian Ocean), we emphasize four
   major drivers of the recent coastal trajectory of vulnerability, i.e.
   changes in human-built assets, shoreline position, natural buffers'
   characteristics, and the extent of coastal protection structures.
   Together, these drivers highlight the need for controlling the
   urbanisation process to reduce the anthropogenic pressures exerted on
   morphological-ecological systems, restoring the buffering function of
   the latter, and moving towards a less hard structure-dependent coastal
   defence strategy. Such a shift in coastal management however supposes
   some radical changes in the way coastal development strategies consider
   environmental issues (hazards, resources and services). Here we bring
   empirical material showing that neither Reunion Island decision-makers
   are keen to drive such radical changes, nor the population is ready to
   accept potentially constraining policies that will have benefits only in
   the future. We conclude on the need for further advancing the design of
   adaptation pathways that build on the implementation of context-specific
   unavoidable solutions, and thus that seriously consider limiting the
   risk of maladaptation as a baseline strategy.},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly impacting ecosystems globally.
   Understanding adaptive genetic diversity and whether it will keep pace
   with projected climatic change is necessary to assess species'
   vulnerability and design efficient mitigation strategies such as
   assisted adaptation. Kelp forests are the foundations of temperate reefs
   globally but are declining in many regions due to climate stress. A lack
   of knowledge of kelp's adaptive genetic diversity hinders assessment of
   vulnerability under extant and future climates. Using 4245 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we characterized patterns of neutral
   and putative adaptive genetic diversity for the dominant kelp in the
   southern hemisphere (Ecklonia radiata) from similar to 1000 km of
   coastline off Western Australia. Strong population structure and
   isolation-by-distance was underpinned by significant signatures of
   selection related to temperature and light. Gradient forest analysis of
   temperature-linked SNPs under selection revealed a strong association
   with mean annual temperature range, suggesting adaptation to local
   thermal environments. Critically, modelling revealed that predicted
   climate-mediated temperature changes will probably result in high
   genomic vulnerability via a mismatch between current and future
   predicted genotype-environment relationships such that kelp forests off
   Western Australia will need to significantly adapt to keep pace with
   projected climate change. Proactive management techniques such as
   assisted adaptation to boost resilience may be required to secure the
   future of these kelp forests and the immense ecological and economic
   values they support.},

Title = {Adaptation of lodgepole pine and interior spruce to climate:
   implications for reforestation in a warming world},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {409-419},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We investigated adaptation to climate in populations of two widespread
   tree species across a range of contrasting environments in western
   Canada. In a series of common garden experiments, bud phenology, cold
   hardiness, and seedling growth traits were assessed for 254 populations
   in the interior spruce complex (Picea glauca, P.engelmannii, and their
   hybrids) and for 281 populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta).
   Complex multitrait adaptations to different ecological regions such as
   boreal, montane, coastal, and arid environments accounted for 15-20\% of
   the total variance. This population differentiation could be directly
   linked to climate variables through multivariate regression tree
   analysis. Our results suggest that adaptation to climate does not always
   correspond linearly to temperature gradients. For example, opposite
   trait values (e.g., early versus late budbreak) may be found in response
   to apparently similar cold environments (e.g., boreal and montane).
   Climate change adaptation strategies may therefore not always be
   possible through a simple shift of seed sources along environmental
   gradients. For the two species in this study, we identified a relatively
   small number of uniquely adapted populations (11 for interior spruce and
   nine for lodgepole pine) that may be used to manage adaptive variation
   under current and expected future climates.},

Title = {Stakeholder perceptions of climate change in the context of bivalve
   aquaculture},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {121-129},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change, observed as warming sea surface temperatures, is
   expected to impact the Eastern coast of Canada at a rate higher than the
   global average. Changes in marine abiotic conditions will impact the
   growth and performance of economically important bivalve species,
   creating an increasingly uncertain future for the bivalve aquaculture
   industry. Site-selection for new farms, and the management of extant
   ones could mitigate these potential impacts, but the implementation of
   this planning process is dependent on stakeholder support and
   engagement. Recognizing the importance of stakeholder input in
   management decisions, this research analyzed the perspectives of
   farmers, researchers, and managers from Nova Scotia (NS) and Prince
   Edward Island (PEI) on the relationship between climate change and
   bivalve aquaculture. Stakeholder perspectives were analyzed using a
   semi-quantitative interview method (Q methodology). These perspectives
   indicated the need for a higher level of integration both between
   stakeholder groups, namely farmers and managers, and management tools
   and climate change. Increased understanding between farmers and managers
   could be achieved through the use of researchers as knowledge brokers,
   collaborating and communicating with both groups. Making use of
   management tools, such as the ecosystem approach to aquaculture,
   required insurance, and adaptive management, governmental bodies on both
   a federal and provincial level can act as channels by which uncertainty
   generated by climate change can be further reduced. In summary,
   stakeholder perception can be used by marine planners to adapt to these
   foreseen changes, and to promote the expansion of this industry.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {135-153},
Abstract = {Most of the aquaculture production in South-east Asia occurs in the
   floodplains and coastal areas that are highly exposed and vulnerable to
   climate change impacts and sea-level rise (SLR). This chapter presents
   an example of economic estimation of autonomous adaptation by shrimp and
   catfish farms in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. It illustrates how planned
   adaptation measures can help defray catfish farmers' escalating costs of
   raising pond dykes in response to increased flooding in the delta. It
   also indicates that government policy and public investment into planned
   adaptation towards climate change impacts, particularly for water
   resources management, would necessarily take account of socio-economic
   development targets of the aquaculture industry. From these analyses,
   broader implications of plans for water resources management in the
   delta on the prospects and challenges to the aquaculture sector are
   discussed. In the long term, a `no-regrets' strategy of reducing the
   high dependence on shrimp and catfish culture and diversifying into more
   ecologically oriented production systems can also hedge the aquaculture
   industry against the increasing risks and uncertainties brought about by
   climate change.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As climate change impacts become increasingly apparent, adaptation
   becomes increasingly urgent. Accordingly, adaptation to climate change
   has shifted towards the centre of attention in both policy and research.
   In this article, we review the last 10 years of adaptation research
   (2008-2018), with a focus on work within the Earth System Governance
   network. We use the lens of access and allocation to structure our
   review and examine how adaptation affects, and is affected by, access to
   basic needs, basic rights, and decision-making on the one hand, as well
   as allocation of responsibilities, resources, and risks on the other. We
   find that questions of justice, equity, and fairness are fundamental to
   all dimensions of adaptation. The access perspective, for example,
   suggests that we need to assess vulnerability, understood broadly, while
   the allocation perspective focuses on questions of responsibility for
   being vulnerable, e.g. when people live, or move to, hazard-prone areas
   exposed to climate risk. This also relates to questions of who is
   responsible for selecting, implementing, and funding adaptation
   measures. Overall, we find that the framework of ``access and
   allocation{''} and its subcategories offer a detailed approach to
   adaptation and adaptation research, but that it is not intuitive. The
   notion of ``climate justice{''} seems to resonate more with both
   academic and policy debates.},

Title = {Urban Overheating and Cooling Potential in Australia: An Evidence-Based
   Review},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cities in Australia are experiencing unprecedented levels of urban
   overheating, which has caused a significant impact on the country's
   socioeconomic environment. This article provides a comprehensive review
   on urban overheating, its impact on health, energy, economy, and the
   heat mitigation potential of a series of strategies in Australia.
   Existing studies show that the average urban heat island (UHI) intensity
   ranges from 1.0 degrees C to 13.0 degrees C. The magnitude of urban
   overheating phenomenon in Australia is determined by a combination of
   UHI effects and dualistic atmospheric circulation systems (cool sea
   breeze and hot desert winds). The strong relation between multiple
   characteristics contribute to dramatic fluctuations and high
   spatiotemporal variabilities in urban overheating. In addition, urban
   overheating contributes to serious impacts on human health, energy
   costs, thermal comfort, labour productivity, and social behaviour.
   Evidence suggest that cool materials, green roofs, vertical gardens,
   urban greenery, and water-based technologies can significantly alleviate
   the UHI effect, cool the ambient air, and create thermally balanced
   cities. Urban greenery, especially trees, has a high potential for
   mitigation. Trees and hedges can reduce the average maximum UHI by 1.0
   degrees C. The average maximum mitigation performance values of green
   roofs and green walls are 0.2 degrees C and 0.1 degrees C, respectively.
   Reflective roofs and pavements can reduce the average maximum UHI by 0.3
   degrees C. In dry areas, water has a high cooling potential. The average
   maximum cooling potential using only one technology is 0.4 degrees C.
   When two or more technologies are used at the same time, the average
   maximum UHI drop is 1.5 degrees C. The mitigation strategies identified
   in this article can help the governments and other stakeholders manage
   urban heating in the natural and built environment, and save health,
   energy, and economic costs.},

Title = {Modelling climate-change impacts on stream temperature of Formosan
   landlocked salmon habitat},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1629-1649},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {A physics-based model is provided for predicting the impact of climate
   change on stream temperature and, in turn, on Formosan landlocked salmon
   (Oncorhynchus masou formosanus) habitat. Because upstream watersheds on
   Taiwan Island are surrounded with hi-h and steep mountains, the
   influence of mountain shading on solar radiation and longwave radiation
   is taken into account by using a digital elevation model. Projections
   using CGCM2 and HADCM3 models and CCCM and GISS models provided
   information on future climatic conditions. The results indicate that
   annual average stream temperatures may rise by 0.5 degrees C (HADCM3
   short term) to 2.9 degrees C (CGCM2 long term) due to climate change.
   The simulation results also indicate that the average suitable habitat
   for the Formosan landlocked salmon may decline by 333 m (HADCM3 short
   term) to 1633 m (CGCM2 long term) and 166 m (HADCM3 short term) to 1833
   m (CGCM2 long term) depending on which thermal criterion (17 degrees C
   and 18 degrees C respectively) is applied. The results of this study
   draw attention to the tasks of Formosan landlocked salmon conservation
   agencies, not only with regard to restoration plans of the local
   environment, but also to the mitigation strategies to global climate
   change that are necessary and require further research. Copyright (c)

Title = {Navigating urban heat-Assessing the potential of a pedestrian routing

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cities are experiencing unprecedented climate impacts related to
   increasing temperatures, which vary within a city due to the
   heterogenous nature of urban environments. Adapting urban areas to heat
   requires efforts on multiple levels from urban governance, spatial
   planning and design to adapting everyday activities. This paper presents
   the prototype of a pedestrian routing tool to support citizens in
   navigating urban heat, and the results of tests and interviews with 24
   prac-titioners and experts in Portugal and Sweden. The study aims to
   assess how and to what extent a navigation tool on urban heat could
   support urban climate risk management, and to evaluate the potential of
   the tool to support everyday adaptation and increase citizen engagement.
   We explore what functionality and additional information would be
   required to make the tool useful and relevant for different user groups.
   Results indicate that (i) climate services that fit in your pocket
   increase access to climate information and have potential to guide
   everyday adaptation practices; and (ii) applications need to be
   contextualized and tailored to match the needs and decision contexts of
   the user through integration of relevant information or tools.},

Journal = {METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6},
Pages = {453-469},
Abstract = {Like most of the countries in the Great Horn of Africa, Tanzania is
   prone to f oods and droughts. Anomalously wet years over the region are
   associated with low-level convergence, the advection of moisture from
   both the Indian Ocean and the Congo and an ascending limb of the Walker
   circulation cell centered over the western Indian Ocean (WIO). During
   positive Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events, the Walker circulation cell
   over the Indian Ocean is well defi ed, and more so compared with
   observed during El Nino years. In El Nino years, the Walker circulation
   cell becomes weak compared with positive IOD events, where the zonal
   winds strengthen, resulting in active convective activities over the
   WIO. A key fi ding is that the Walker circulation cell developing over
   the Indian Ocean is strongly connected to IOD activity. The weakening of
   the Walker circulation cell is likely the reason for the decrease in
   rainfall during El Nino events compared with that of positive IOD events
   in recent years over Tanzania during the October-December season. The
   variability of the Walker circulation cell over the Indian Ocean can
   lead to extreme weather conditions, making the full understanding of the
   climate system essential. This is crucial for decision making about
   adaptation and mitigation measures for coping with climate change and
   for the minimization of huge socio-economic losses associated with
   extreme weather events in the region.},

Title = {Vulnerability of tourism to climate change on the Mediterranean coastal

Abstract = {The north-western Mediterranean coast of Egypt, including the study area
   from El Hammam to EL Alamein, is a hub for economic and coastal tourism
   development. Coastal tourism is recognized as a driving force for the
   economic development and sustainability in Egypt, however, it is an
   environment and climate-dependent industry. This study explores the
   potential impacts of climate change (CC) and the sea-level rise (SLR) on
   coastal tourism in El Hammam-EL Alamein area. The adopted methodological
   framework for this study comprises the assessment of the vulnerability
   of the area and the coastal tourism to climate change and sea-level rise
   via the development of a digital elevation model (DEM) and inundation
   models, besides the assessment of the temperature change employing the
   tourism climate index (TCI). The (DEM) and inundation models demonstrate
   the vulnerability of the eastern sector of the study area to the
   projected (SLR) following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6 \& 8.5) scenarios.
   Consequently, 34 to 36 coastal resorts will be inundated (about 46.5\%
   and 49.3\%) from the existing 74 resorts; and most likely the area will
   experience the following: (a) regression of the shoreline and beach
   erosion, (b) damage of the coastal infrastructure, (c) devalue of the
   coastal tourism destination, and (d) decline of revenues. The tourism
   climate index revealed that the area at present ranges from very good to
   ideal, in terms of tourism climatic suitability, however, it will
   experience in the future a shift in the peak seasons from the summer
   months to the autumn and spring seasons. Assessment of the existing
   adaptive measures in the area indicates their inadequacy to face the
   future (CC) and (SLR) and other natural risks such as storms and
   tsunamis. Actions for adaptation and protection measures to minimize the
   projected adverse impact of (CC) are proposed to ensure the coastal
   development and tourism sustainability of the area.},

   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS},

Abstract = {Within the framework of its adaptation strategy to climate change, the
   EU adopted the upper limit of 2 degrees C (UNFCCC, Cancun 2010) as an
   allowable increase concerning the average air temperature of the planet.
   This decision aims at compulsorily reducing the most serious risks from
   climate change. The UN Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP21 2015)
   emphasizing the holding of the increase in the global average
   temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by
   reducing emissions to 40 Gt or to pursuing efforts to limit the
   temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. Taking into an account the COP21
   climate change strategy, we consider five significant cases. The first
   one for the current climate conditions (corresponds to a 0.8 degrees C
   global warming above the pre-industrial level), the model based on
   logistic equation provides a solution according which, within the next
   95 years, the sea level will rise up to +5 m and stabilize at +6 m level
   within a 150-year relaxation time. The second one, if global warming
   could be reduced of 28.5 times to the value of global average
   temperature 0.028 degrees C, the sea level would stabilize to the
   current value of 0.21 m. The third-if the global average temperature
   will increase to 1.5 degrees C above the pre-industrial era, this will
   lead to an inevitable rise of the global sea level by +11.25 m. The
   fourth-if Earth's global average temperature increases to 2 degrees C
   above the pre-industrial era, this will accelerate the sea-level rise up
   to +15 m. The fifth-a realistic level of the global average temperature
   increase to 3 degrees C will lead to sea-level rise (SLR) by +22.5 m.
   This can happen from 100 years up to 250 years and can be associated
   with carbon dioxide emission and methane blowout from the Ocean. Taking
   into an account the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry climate model
   based on dust emission in atmosphere with +4 degrees C Global Warming up
   to 2050 year, we can predict the very fast SLR up to 30 m. Exceeding the
   critical level of global average temperature +1.30(6)degrees C or the
   +9.8 mSLR will destabilize the Earth climate system and could provoke
   falling in the next Ice Age. This value is 1.53 times less than the +2
   degrees C Global Warming level adopted in Paris (UNFCCC COP21 2015) as
   acceptable for sustainable economic development. Antarctica ice mass
   loss and Greenland ice mass loss are going with the rate of 2.03 and
   1.74, within five-year period (August, 2010-2015) and estimated as total
   589.9 Gt in 2016 that will contribute SLR the 1.628 mm per year. The
   main question is can the national mid-century strategies for the
   transition to low-emission economies stop the SLR before it will be too
   late.},

Abstract = {Many of the world's largest coastal cities are becoming increasingly
   vulnerable to extreme events due to their growing populations and
   infrastructure, the changing climate, and subsidence. This paper
   assessed the economic impacts of extreme climatic events including
   sea-level rise and storm surge risk and the benefits of the adaptation
   strategies in the Pearl River Delta, a lowing-lying area located in
   southern China. An economic benefit-cost model was established for the
   estimation of the impacts and benefits. The damage of the extreme events
   was calculated using the damage rate modeled from the historic disaster
   database, and then the difference between the damage and the cost of
   heightening dikes was investigated under different scenarios. The
   results showed that the damage rate and storm surge level were
   positively related. The adaptation strategies benefited when the dike
   was heightened by 1.43-12.67 m, with the optimum reached at 5.15 m, and
   the dike did not exceed 12.67 m. The maximum benefits were obtained when
   the dike was designed to defend a 20-year return period storm surge in
   2100, and the minimum when the dike is heightened to defend a 100-year
   return period storm surge in 2100.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change in South Africa: commercial farmers'
   perception of and response to changing climate},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {94},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-173},
Abstract = {Understanding how and why farmers have responded to past climatic change
   is a necessary step to informing how to support current and future
   adaptation. This paper explores commercial farmers' perceptions of and
   responses to shifting climates in the Little Brak River area along South
   Africa's south coast. It aims to evaluate changes in the climate
   experienced in the area by comparing quantitative statistical analyses
   of temperature, rainfall and wind data recorded from 1967 to 2009, with
   qualitative historical narratives and formulated perceptions of change
   for the same period. This was undertaken in order to test the robustness
   of the narratives and to understand how farmers' perceptions and
   experiences drive their climate-related decisions. The narratives
   revealed that the farmers perceived a gradual but dramatic shift in
   climate over almost four decades, including increasing temperatures,
   changing annual rainfall patterns and shifts in predominant wind
   direction, mirrored by the recorded weather data that show similar
   results to the narratives. It is evident that farmers' experience with
   shifting climates has played a large part in driving their adaptive
   decision-making, but financial capital of these commercial farmers has
   also been a major factor enabling certain responses. This research
   contributes to the growing local and regional evidence of variability
   and change to climate systems, and documents how people have already
   responded to change in order to help build locally relevant climate
   change adaptation approaches that could potentially benefit a wider
   range of farmers.},

Title = {Adaptive Management of Return Flows: Lessons from a Case Study in
   Environmental Water Delivery to a Floodplain River},

Abstract = {For many floodplain rivers, reinstating wetland connectivity is
   necessary for ecosystems to recover from decades of regulation.
   Environmental return flows (the managed delivery of wetland water to an
   adjacent river) can be used strategically to facilitate natural
   ecosystem connectivity, enabling the transfer of nutrients, energy, and
   biota from wetland habitats to the river. Using an informal adaptive
   management framework, we delivered return flows from a forested wetland
   complex into a large lowland river in south-eastern Australia. We
   hypothesized that return flows would (a) increase river nutrient
   concentrations; (b) reduce wetland nutrient concentrations; (c) increase
   rates of ecosystem metabolism through the addition of potentially
   limiting nutrients, causing related increases in the concentration of
   water column chlorophyll-a; and (d) increase the density and species
   richness of microinvertebrates in riverine benthic habitats. Our
   monitoring results demonstrated a small increase in the concentrations
   of several key nutrients but no evidence for significant ecological
   responses was found. Although return flows can be delivered from
   forested floodplain areas without risking hypoxic blackwater events,
   returning nutrient and carbon-rich water to increase riverine
   productivity is limited by the achievable scale of return flows.
   Nevertheless, using return flows to flush carbon from floodplains may be
   a useful management tool to reduce carbon loads, preparing floodplains
   for subsequent releases (e.g., mitigating the risk of hypoxic blackwater
   events). In this example, adaptive management benefited from a
   semi-formal collaboration between science and management that allowed
   for prompt decision-making.},

Abstract = {Knowing how species respond to fire regimes is essential for
   ecologically sustainable management. This axiom raises two important
   questions: (1) what knowledge is the most important to develop and (2)
   to what extent can current research methods deliver that knowledge? We
   identify three areas of required knowledge: (i) a mechanistic
   understanding of species' responses to fire regimes; (ii) knowledge of
   how the spatial and temporal arrangement of fires influences the biota;
   and (iii) an understanding of interactions of fire regimes with other
   processes. We review the capacity of empirical research to address these
   knowledge gaps, and reveal many limitations. Manipulative experiments
   are limited by the number and scope of treatments that can be applied,
   natural experiments are limited by treatment availability and
   confounding factors, and longitudinal studies are difficult to maintain,
   particularly due to unplanned disturbance events. Simulation modelling
   is limited by the quality of the underlying empirical data and by
   uncertainty in how well model structure represents reality. Due to the
   constraints on large-scale, long-term research, the potential for
   management experiments to inform adaptive management is limited. Rather
   than simply recommending adaptive management, we define a research
   agenda to maximise the rate of learning in this difficult field. This
   includes measuring responses at a species level, building capacity to
   implement natural experiments, undertaking simulation modelling, and
   judicious application of experimental approaches. Developing
   ecologically sustainable fire management practices will require
   sustained research effort and a sophisticated research agenda based on
   carefully targeting appropriate methods to address critical management
   questions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Obstacles to climate change adaptation decisions: a case study of

Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {International aid is increasingly focused on adaptation to climate
   change. At recent meetings of the parties to the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change, the developed world agreed to
   rapidly increase international assistance to help the developing world
   respond to the impacts of climate change. In this paper, we examine the
   decision-making challenges facing internationally supported climate
   change adaptation projects, using the example of efforts to implement
   coastal protection measures (e.g. sea walls, mangrove planting) in
   Kiribati. The central equatorial Pacific country is home to the Kiribati
   Adaptation Project, the first national-level climate change adaptation
   project supported by the World Bank. Drawing on interview and document
   research conducted over an 8-year period, we trace the forces
   influencing decisions about coastal protection measures, starting from
   the variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, through
   the trade-offs between different measures, to the social, political, and
   economic context in which decisions are finally made. We then discuss
   how sub-optimal adaptation measures may be implemented despite years of
   planning, consultation, and technical studies. This qualitative analysis
   of the real-world process of climate change adaptation reveals that
   embracing a culturally appropriate and short-term (similar to 20 years)
   planning horizon, while not ignoring the longer-term future, may reduce
   the influence of scientific uncertainty on decisions and provide
   opportunities to learn from mistakes, reassess the science, and adjust
   suboptimal investments. The limiting element in this approach to
   adaptation is likely to be the availability of consistent, long-term
   financing.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the livelihood situation of small-scale coastal
   fisherfolk in the Western Region of Ghana. This paper is one of the
   first studies focusing on coastal spatial mobility strategies to improve
   living standards adopted by fisherfolk in sub-Saharan Africa. It
   examines how fisherfolk livelihoods have been affected by the extraction
   and production of oil. The study further explores the various livelihood
   strategies deployed by fisherfolk to avoid decrease fish catch. A mixed-
   methods approach made up of 400 fisherfolk households survey and 42
   interviews with stakeholders in the fisheries and the petroleum
   industries were conducted. The study shows that fisherfolk in the
   Western Region of Ghana are under high socioeconomic vulnerability
   because of decreased fish catch and declining coastal livelihoods. The
   spatial restriction of fishers' mobility offshore, the destruction and
   confiscation of fishing gear, the presence of seaweed in the ocean, and
   the lack of land opportunities are some of the key petroleum-induced
   stressors on fisheries livelihoods. The various in situ marine-based
   adaptation strategies deployed by fisherfolk, especially illegal light
   fishing and fishing around oil rigs, are unsustainable and are
   counterproductive in the rebuilding of depleted marine fish stocks.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights and expands on the extensive work concerning
   extreme heat events, and the environmental and societal factors that
   affect human health. Selections of this work were presented originally
   in a Union of Concerned Scientists public report (Heat in the
   Heartland'). As humans respond concomitantly to a suite of
   meteorological variables, we accordingly aim to examine summertime
   frequencies and characteristics of select synoptic weather types in the
   Midwestern United States, particularly those associated with elevated
   health impacts risk. We analyse five major urban centres, paired with
   five nearby smaller cities, to investigate the potential relative
   differences due to urban form and size. In virtually all of these
   locales, the frequency of health-debilitating hot weather types has
   increased in the six most recent decades, with many of these also
   demonstrating statistically significant upward trends in air and dew
   point temperatures. This is most prevalent for overnight temperatures,
   where the hottest weather types display increasing overnight
   temperatures in both large and small cities, thus causing the diurnal
   temperature ranges to decrease. Furthermore, the prevalence of three or
   more consecutive runs of these days is on the rise, with all five large
   cities experiencing a higher number of heat waves today than in the late
   1940s. We emphasize the importance of city-level efforts to assist in
   minimizing future climate-related health risks. Finally, we demonstrate
   the increasing human mortality response in one select city (Detroit,
   MI), which is estimated without the presence of city-level efforts,
   targeted interventions, adaptation strategies, or physiological
   acclimatization. This highlights the importance of providing accurate
   heat-health warnings to the public, and provides essential understanding
   of the Midwest US region's summertime climate trends.},

Abstract = {Social conflicts related to biodiversity conservation and adaptation
   policy to climate change in coastal areas illustrate the need to
   reinforce understanding of the ``matters of concern{''} as well as the
   ``matters of fact{''}. In this paper, we argue that we must rethink
   adaptation from a new perspective, considering that humans together
   function as both ecological actors and social actors. Using
   international examples from the UNESCO world biosphere reserve network,
   we show that an ontological perspective may provide a simple and compact
   way to think about coupled infrastructure systems and systematic
   formalism, allowing for understanding of the relational matrix between
   actors, institutions and ecosystems. We contend that our formalism
   responds to three challenges. First, it encompasses the different
   regional contexts and policies that rely on the same ontology. Second,
   it provides a method to relate any local adaptation plan to the
   conservation paradigms that originate from the ecological modernization
   of policies. Third, it facilitates the discovery of drivers and
   processes involved in adaptation and management regime shifts by
   highlighting the way contextual factors configure, determine the
   structure of the action situation of the Institutional Analysis and
   Development framework (IAD) (Ostrom 2005), and how it operates.},

Title = {Collaborative Strategies for Re-Enhancing Hapu Connections to Lands and
   Making Changes with Our Climate},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {21-46},
Abstract = {Since 1996, considerable challenges have faced hapu in terms of
   ecosystem decline in lands and waterways within southwestern coastal
   Maori lands from the Horowhenua to Kapiti regions of Te Ika a Maui/
   North Island, Aotearoa New Zealand. The rationales for hapu re-enhancing
   intergenerational connections to their lands have required culturally
   led, collaborative, innovative, solutions-focused, and transformative
   actions to reinstate well-being to areas of cultural and natural value.
   Beginning with the project ``Manaaki Taha Moana: Enhancing Coastal
   Ecosystems for Iwi and Hapu{''} (2010-2015), hapu have collaborated with
   specialists to cocreate new frameworks for addressing short-term issues
   and long-term impacts of sea-level rise, leading to the ``Adaptation
   Strategies for Climate Change for Coastal Maori Communities{''} project
   (2015-2017). Building on Maori methods such as wananga, hui, and hikoi,
   these approaches have strengthened localized cultural knowledge of place
   as the lens through which climate change and fluvial geomorphology
   sciences can be viewed. Developed design scenarios have encouraged
   beneficial relationships between culture, settlement form, ecologies,
   economies, and farming practices in order to better prepare Maori
   communities for the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of climate
   change. Art and design have helped bridge Maori culture, sciences, and
   communities' understanding of complex data within university-based and
   curated exhibitions. The latest project, ``Risk Management Planning for
   Climate Change Impacts on Maori Coastal Ecosystems and Economies{''}
   (2017-2019), envisages integrative decision-making tools to enable more
   coastal Maori landholders to assess the risks and benefits associated
   with alternative coastal land uses and economies.},

Title = {Green adaptation by innovative dike concepts along the Dutch Wadden Sea
   coast},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {108-125},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper describes the development and application of an approach to
   adapt the existing flood defences along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast to
   the effects of climate change and sea level rise in the context of other
   uncertainties and developments. It starts with the development of a
   dike-portfolio with traditional as well as new flood protection
   concepts. Next these concepts are evaluated by means of a multi-criteria
   analysis by local experts. The objective is to identify realistic
   adaptation options that use or enable natural processes to strengthen
   ecological resilience and facilitate sustainable human use in the Wadden
   region. In our analyses Eco-engineering concepts (in rural areas) as
   well as a Multifunctional dike (in built-up areas) received the highest
   scores. Multifunctional dikes are robust and offer space for other
   functions and values. However, their performance in an integral
   assessment strongly depends on the applied functions and the weight per
   evaluation criterion. Eco-engineering concepts can potentially
   contribute to nature and landscape values, but implementation may lead
   to tension with nature legislation. For the Wadden Sea landscape, which
   is characterised by the presence of semi-natural salt marshes, the
   application of vegetated foreshores for flood protection comes forward
   as being particularly attractive. For every specific stretch of the 227
   km long coastline the study has identified the most promising dike
   concept. The result of this study has been adopted by the national
   government and the regional water boards as a basis for more detailed
   analysis and design per stretch of coast. Additional modelling studies
   and cost benefit analyses will be required at this stage to verify the
   outcome of our studies and to optimise the design. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Options for managing human threats to high seas biodiversity},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {187},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) constitute 61\% of the world's
   oceans and are collectively managed by countries under the United
   Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Growing concern
   regarding the deteriorating state of the oceans and ineffective
   management of ABNJ has resulted in negotiations to develop an
   international legally binding instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and
   sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction under
   UNCLOS. To inform these negotiations, we identified existing and
   emerging human activities and influences that affect ABNJ and evaluated
   management options available to mitigate the most pervasive, with
   highest potential for impact and probability of emergence. The
   highest-ranking activities and influences that affect ABNJ were
   fishing/hunting, maritime shipping, climate change and its associated
   effects, land-based pollution and mineral exploitation. Management
   options are diverse and available through a variety of actors, although
   their actions are not always effective. Area-based management tools
   (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs), were the only
   consistently effective option to mitigate impacts across high-ranked
   activities and influences. However, addressing land-based pollution will
   require national action to prevent this at its source, and MPAs offer
   only a partial solution for climate change. A new ABNJ ILBI could help
   unify management options and actors to conserve marine biodiversity and
   ensure sustainable use. Incorporating a mechanism to establish effective
   ABMTs into the ILBI will help deliver multiple objectives based on the
   ecosystem approach.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Despite living in what was described as a ``layer cake made of Jell-O,
   floating in a swirling Jacuzzi of steadily warming, rising water,{''}
   many Louisiana residents of Terrebonne Parish, which is contained
   entirely within the coastal zone, repeatedly express a strong commitment
   to remain in place. Combining analyses of primary and secondary
   materials with crucial informant interviews, conducted in 2012-15, the
   empirical focus of this research documents how the intersections of
   resilient practices, sense of place, and social relations play out for
   those who continue to return, (re)adapt, and rebuild after a hurricane,
   tropical storm, sharp decline in seafood prices, or other fast- or
   slow-moving disaster. This research seeks to answer the following two
   questions: (1) how can residents' sense of place, resilient practices,
   and social relations affect the processes surrounding possibilities of
   migration? and (2) what is the relationship between these three factors
   and the places in which interviewees reside? At present, little is known
   about how the identities of coastal Louisiana residents, interconnected
   and contingent on social relations, sense of, and attachment to, place
   affect the decisions surrounding migration possibilities.},

Abstract = {The acceleration of global warming and increased vulnerability of marine

   Spatial planning of marine areas is vital to balance multiple human
   demands and ensure a healthy ocean, while supporting global ocean goals.
   To thrive in a changing ocean though, marine spatial planning (MSP) must
   effectively integrate climate change. By reviewing existing literature
   on MSP and climate change, we explore the links between them and with
   ocean sustainability, highlight management challenges, and identify
   potential pathways to guide action towards the effective integration of
   climate impacts in MSP.
   A review of marine spatial planning literature identifies links with
   climate change and gaps in the practical integration of both concepts.},

Abstract = {Communities in coastal regions are affected by the impacts of extreme
   climatic events causing flooding and erosion. Reducing the impacts of
   flood and erosion in these areas by adopting coping strategies that
   fortify the resilience of individuals and their localities is desirable.
   This study used summative content analysis to explore the coping
   mechanisms of coastal communities before, during, and after various
   dangers relating to flooding and erosion. The findings from the study
   show that effective surveillance systems, disaster preparedness, risk
   mapping, early warning systems, availability of databases and functional
   command systems, as well as reliable funding are essential to
   efficiently cope with hazards of coastal flooding and erosion. As
   flooding and erosion have been predicted to be more severe due to
   climate change in the coming years, the adoption of effective natural
   and artificial mechanisms with modern technologies could help coastal
   regions to be more resilient in coping with the dangers associated with
   flooding and erosion. Pragmatic policies and programs to this end by
   actors are critical to averting crises induced by flooding and erosion

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation has shifted from a single-dimension to an
   integrative approach that aligns with vulnerability and resilience
   concepts. Adaptation planning, correspondingly, is guided by three
   frameworks categorized as the hazard-based, the vulnerability-based, and
   the urban resilience framework. Exploring in which ways these frameworks
   affect the proposed adaptation initiatives is crucial for planners to
   justify the well-fit approach for adaptation planning. This study seeks
   to examine the influence of these theoretical frameworks on the
   formulation of adaptation initiatives with a sample of 45 coastal cities
   in developing countries. The vulnerability framework is found to tackle
   the issues of climate change sufficiently while the hazard-based
   approach shares resources for both climate change and other matters, and
   the urban resilience framework puts more effort into other issues rather
   than climate change. From these findings, the study offers implications
   for adaptation planning in applying each of these three frameworks.},

Abstract = {The Interreg IIIB BRANCH project evaluated potential impacts of climate
   change on coastal wildlife in Northwest Europe and aimed at identifying
   planning strategies in cooperation with stakeholders. A specific
   technical and methodological effort focused on elaborating a GIS as a
   support for prospective work. This paper deals with the example of the
   French coastal case study sites in Normandy:
   1. Several key marine and coastal habitats and species have been studied
   (quantity, quality, localization, evolution) so as to integrate
   ecosystem functionalities in scenarios showing risks on marine habitats
   versus climate change factors (sea level rise, temperature rising):
   benthic fauna, flora, bird, arthropods, and hydrosedimentary dynamics.
   2. A new method has been elaborated in order to build a common database
   integrating pluridisciplinary information, to elaborate an initial
   status assessment, to support long-term monitoring, and to be flexible,
   to progressively integrate new marine, social, and economical knowledge.
   The results were presented and debated at regional and national
   workshops, which raised seven main recommendations for adaptation
   measures leading to a better consideration of climate change in coastal
   management and its effects on biodiversity:
   1. To anticipate in order to reduce impacts: it is essential to act now
   2. To improve information and awareness of local stakeholders: to better
   assess the socioeconomic issues of climate change
   3. To build up a shared vision: among local stakeholders on challenges
   and planning measures to be taken
   4. To reduce the uncertainties: in order to reduce their inhibitory
   effect on the decision-making processes
   5. To respect the natural processes: which guarantee the sustainable
   development of the coast
   6. To integrate climate change into public policies: a specific
   transversal policy on climate change is essential, from large to local
   scale
   7. To diversify and improve tools: BRANCH highlights the need of
   considering biodiversity as dynamic, functional, and at larger spatial
   and time scales, in order to help wildlife adapt to climate change and
   to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services the local stakeholders
   lack operational tools to decide and to act; they wish to benefit from
   coordinated protocols and a detailed road map that guide them towards
   adequate measures for the short, mid, and long terms.},

Abstract = {While glacier volumes in most cold mountain ranges rapidly decrease due
   to continued global warming, degradation of permafrost at altitudes
   above and below glaciers is much slower. As a consequence, many still
   existing glacier and permafrost landscapes probably transform within
   decades into new landscapes of bare bedrock, loose debris, sparse
   vegetation, numerous new lakes and steep slopes with slowly degrading
   permafrost. These new landscapes are likely to persist for centuries if
   not millennia to come.
   During variable but mostly extended future time periods, such new
   landscapes will be characterized by pronounced disequilibria within
   their geo- and ecosystems. This especially involves long-term stability
   reduction of steep/icy mountain slopes as a slow and delayed reaction to
   stress redistribution following de-buttressing by vanishing glaciers and
   to changes in mechanical strength and hydraulic permeability caused by
   permafrost degradation. Thereby, the probability of far-reaching flood
   waves from large mass movements into lakes systematically increases with
   the formation of many new lakes and systems of lakes in dose
   neighborhood to. or even directly at the foot of, so-affected slopes.
   Results of recent studies in the Swiss Alps are reviewed and
   complemented with examples from the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and the
   Mount Everest region in Nepal.
   Hot spots of future hazards from potential flood waves caused by large
   rock falls into new lakes can already now be recognized. To this end,
   integrated spatial information on glacier/permafrost evolution and lake
   formation can be used together with scenario-based models for rapid mass
   movements, impact waves and flood propagation. The resulting information
   must then be combined with exposure and vulnerability considerations
   related to settlements and infrastructure. This enables timely planning
   of risk reduction options. Such risk reduction options consist of two
   components: Mitigation of hazards, which in the present context are due
   to effects from climate change, and reduction in consequences, which
   result from societal conditions and changes. Hazard mitigation may
   include artificial lake drainage or lake-level lowering and flood
   retention, optimally in connection with multipurpose structures for
   hydropower production and/or irrigation. Reduction in damage potential
   (exposure, vulnerability) can be accomplished by installing
   early-warning systems, adapting spatial planning and/or by improving
   preparedness of local people and institutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Review and Comparative Study of Decision Support Tools for the
   Mitigation of Urban Heat Stress},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the last few decades, Urban Heat Stress (UHS) has become a crucial
   concern of scientists and policy-makers. Many projects have been
   implemented to mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects using
   nature-based solutions. However, decision-making and selecting an
   adequate framework are difficult because of complex interactions between
   natural, social, economic and built environments. This paper contributes
   to the UHI issue by: (i) identifying the most important key factors of a
   Decision Support Tool (DST) used for urban heat mitigation, (ii)
   presenting multi-criteria methods applied to urban heat resilience,
   (iii) reviewing existing spatial and non-spatial DSTs, (iv) and
   analyzing, classifying and ranking DSTs. It aims to help decision-makers
   through an overview of the pros and cons of existing DSTs and indicate
   which tool is providing maximum support for choosing and planning heat
   resilience measures from the designing phase to the heat mitigation
   phase. This review shows that Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
   can be used for any pilot site and the criteria can be adapted to the
   given location accordingly. It also highlights that GIS-based spatial
   tools have an effective decision support system (DSS) because they offer
   a quick assessment of interventions and predict long-term effects of
   urban heat. Through a comparative study using specific chosen criteria,
   we conclude that the DSS tool is well suited and fulfils many
   prerequisites to support new policies and interventions to mitigate UHS.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {288},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Climate change has induced increasingly alarming impacts on urban
   environment. Adaptation is one of the most common measures to mitigate
   the impacts and reduce vulnerability. This study explored the individual
   adaptation from a cognitive and psychological perspective that has
   rarely been adopted. The current study aims to measure the risk
   perception (RP) and perceived adaptive capacity (PAC) of individuals and
   explore the relationships of the two factors with the attitude and
   behavior on sustainable adaptation. Some 483 successful questionnaire
   samples were collected through telephone surveys in Hong Kong. Our major
   findings include: (1) the inconsistent results from regression analysis
   of PAC as a single construct and results from factors of PAC obtained
   from exploratory factor analysis; (2) higher level of PAC in terms of
   ``Mental flexibility, knowledge and interest in global warming{''}
   promotes sustainable attitude on adaptation and frequency of use of
   electrical fan; (3) sustainable attitude of individuals is weaker when
   they perceive a high effectiveness in their adaptive action and
   availability of resource; and (4) individuals demonstrating higher level
   of risk perception uses air-conditioners more frequently. The results
   showed that some individuals might express maladaptations which may
   potentially lead to a deterioration of overall public adaptation and
   long-term sustainability in the society. Such an aberrant response would
   imply a need for education on concepts of risk and sustainability on
   climate change adaptation to rectify the misconception. (C) 2020

Title = {Resilience and Social Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts in
   Small-Scale Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Small-cale fisheries are important for livelihoods, food security, jobs
   and income worldwide. However, they face major challenges, including the
   increasing effects of climate change that pose serious risks to coastal
   ecosystems and fishing communities. Although scientific research on
   climate change impacts has increased in recent years, few studies have
   explored the social impacts on small-scale fisheries. Using Galicia
   (Spain) as a case study, we investigated individual and household-level
   adaptive responses to climate change among fishers in three fishing
   guilds (Cambados, Campelo, and Redondela). Specifically, we estimated
   the economic vulnerability of shellfishers and assessed the diversity of
   social adaptive responses used to deal with climate change. Although
   fishers' income strongly depends on shellfishing in all studied areas,
   our findings show that less fishing experience and lower engagement in
   fisher associations tend to increase the economic vulnerability of the
   fishers. The fishers' vulnerability decreases as the size of households
   increases, while fishers who pay a mortgage and who live in households
   with fewer active members tend to be more vulnerable. The findings also
   show that Galician shellfishers have developed a wide range of
   adaptation strategies to anticipate and respond to climate change
   impacts, namely harvesting pricier and more abundant species, reducing
   household expenses and increasing social involvement in shellfishery
   associations. Although the adaptive strategies have helped Galician
   fishers to deal with climate change impacts, several threats to the
   sustainability of shellfisheries remain, such as a decrease in the
   abundance of key native shellfish species, and a high dependence on
   public and private aid to ensure reasonable incomes for shellfisheries.
   These findings are of interest and relevance to other similar
   small-scale fisheries around the world facing similar climate change
   challenges.},

Abstract = {In the next future, cities located in coastal areas are likely to suffer
   for climatic changes more than all other human systems. The demographic
   growth, combined with sea-level rise and global warming related to
   natural causes and anthropogenic activities, endanger those systems.
   Thence, to effectually cope with new climate forcing, coastal cities
   need improvements to be sustainable, resilient and liveable, applying
   flexible design approaches rather than a traditional one. The paper
   highlights such concepts presenting two case studies of important
   coastal cities: Venice, in Northern Italy, and Jakarta, the capital city
   of Indonesia. Although characterized by completely different climatic
   conditions and living habits, these two metropolises are highly impacted
   by humans and threatened by similar factors like subsidence and
   sea-level rise, which increase their exposure to future calamities
   principally driven by climate change but strictly related to anthropic
   pressures. The present situation shows that, for the future, the
   resilience of coastal megalopolis can be increased only using a mix of
   approaches at various levels, spanning from technical measures to
   adaptable planning instruments that consider future uncertainties.},

Title = {Assessment of coastal risk reduction and adaptation-labelled responses
   in Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean)},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {This study assesses changes in coastal risk reduction and
   adaptation-labelled responses in Mauritius Island since the 1960s. Using
   research documents, interviews, field observations, image analysis, and
   case studies, it analyses evolutions in public and private stakeholders'
   strategies, and the levers and barriers at play. Based on 60 beach
   sites, it reveals the prevalence (76.7\%) of hard protection compared
   with no response (8.3\%), ecosystem-based responses (3.3\%), and
   combined responses (11.7\%) and a nation-wide shift from hard and
   one-size-fits-all responses to soft and place-specific responses. This
   shift was driven by the failure of initial hard protection measures,
   which has pushed the Government of Mauritius to improve beach management
   practices, promote retreat where hard protection had failed, resort to
   external expertise and funding to design a well-informed risk reduction
   and adaptation policy, and implement demonstration projects. The
   ``learning-by-doing{''} process and increased external support have thus
   allowed progress in risk reduction and adaptation at publicly managed
   beach sites. In contrast, privately managed (i.e. by residents and hotel
   companies) beach sites often exhibit increased risks, as a result of the
   proliferation of uncoordinated technical interventions, related
   cascading (beach loss, spread of coastal erosion downdrift), and lock-in
   effects. This study provides guidance for the ground-rooted and
   systematic analysis of coastal risk reduction and adaptation responses
   and their drivers at the local and national scale. It could serve as a
   first basis for framing nation-wide assessments aimed at taking stock of
   recent progress in coastal risk reduction and adaptation worldwide and
   help overcome barriers to adaptation.},

Title = {A Framework for Planning and Evaluating the Role of Urban Stream
   Restoration for Improving Transportation Resilience to Extreme Rainfall
   Events},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent extreme rainfall events produced severe flooding across North
   Carolina's Coastal Plain, revealing deep vulnerabilities in many
   communities. Climate change is expected to exacerbate these problems by
   further increasing rainfall intensity and the frequency of extreme
   rainfall events. Due to the risks posed by these changing rainfall
   patterns, a shift in the approach to infrastructure planning and
   management is needed for many floodprone communities, particularly in
   regard to managing streams and floodplains in urban areas. This study
   proposes a framework for systematically evaluating stream restoration in
   combination with engineered improvements to culvert and bridge crossings
   to identify and optimize options for mitigating extreme events in urban
   areas. To illustrate the methodology, extensive hydraulic modeling was
   conducted to test four different strategies for reducing flooding along
   a channelized and armored stream, Big Ditch, located in Goldsboro, North
   Carolina, USA. The results indicate that neither floodplain restoration
   nor infrastructure modification alone could alleviate flooding along Big
   Ditch. Rather, a combination approach would be required to mitigate
   flooding, which could result in substantial benefits for storms in
   excess of the 100-year event. The results suggest that shifting to a
   multi-faceted approach to improve resiliency to extreme events could
   improve public safety and reduce future damages due to flooding.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Climate change is projected to have large impacts on natural capital and
   ecosystem services under scenarios of the IPCC. In the summer of 2016,
   elevated seawater temperatures triggered mass coral bleaching in Sekisei
   Lagoon, southern Japan. Based on data from field surveys and relevant
   websites, we mapped potential stocks of four major ecosystem services
   (fisheries production, aquarium fish production, recreational diving,
   and seaweed control) supplied by coral reef fishes before and after the
   bleaching event and predicted the possible future state of
   socio-ecological systems in the lagoon under climate change. We also
   evaluated whether current management options had mitigated the negative
   effects of extreme heating and coral bleaching on the potential stocks.
   Before the coral bleaching, the potential stock of recreational diving
   was estimated as 41.44 billion Japanese yen per year for the entire
   lagoon, while those of fisheries and aquarium fish productions were 2.10
   billion and 15.03 billion yen, respectively. After bleaching, the four
   potential stocks including seaweed control decreased. The marine park
   zone and the extermination area of crown of thorns starfish mitigated
   changes in fish species richness and the value of recreational diving
   following coral bleaching. Extreme heating and coral bleaching are
   considered to be representative of a possible future state under global
   warming, and the results suggest that even management for local
   disturbances can mitigate the interactive effect of climate change on
   the potential stocks. Additional integrative management accounting for
   climate change and local stressors would be necessary for protecting
   ecosystem services in Sekisei Lagoon.},

Abstract = {The increasing number of coastal floods in recent years in France has
   resulted in the design of new adaptation principles for the most
   endangered coastal areas. The aim of the government is to reduce the
   vulnerability of these areas by relocating property and infrastructure.
   These measures have, however, come up against considerable opposition
   from the population concerned. Using a survey of 421 inhabitants of
   Hyeres, a coastal town in the South of France, this article proposes the
   study of resistance to relocation through the creation of an index for
   resistance that incorporates attachment to place, residential mobility
   and risk perception. The results show a correlation for the index and
   distance from the sea that highlights the existence of conflicting
   interests with adaptation measures depending upon population categories.
   Key policy insights In France, although coastal flooding risk is a key
   issue in numerous populated coastal areas, coastal dwellers show little
   willingness to relocate. Resistance to relocation can be assessed
   through a composite index integrating place attachment, residential
   mobility and risk perception. Application of such an index shows a
   correlation between willingness to relocate and distance from the sea.
   Conflicts of interest with adaptation measures also depend on the age of
   the dwellers, their standard of living and on home ownership.},

Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER},
Year = {2017},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Water resources in Central Asia are scarce, so complicated issues arise
   from this. Kazakhstan is a Central Asian landlocked country, which has
   mostly closed drainage basins, characterized by endorheic lakes that do
   not drain to the oceans. These endorheic lakes are very sensitive to
   climate change and anthropogenic influences. Very few studies have been
   conducted on the hydrological cycle of the small endorheic lakes. This
   work reviews the endorheic lakes within Burabay National Nature Park
   (BNNP), Northern Kazakhstan. BNNP is a small ecozone consisting of
   terminal lakes watersheds covered by mixed forests and grasslands. These
   endorheic lakes have been drying out during the last one hundred years
   or so with the water level decrease accelerated in the past few decades.
   According to historical observations (1935-2014), on the one hand
   precipitation amounts did not significantly change, while on the other
   hand, air temperature steadily increased. The lake level decrease is
   most probably caused by a water budget deficit, with evaporation
   exceeding the precipitation inputs in the long term. The direct
   anthropogenic impact (water abstraction) plays a minor role in the
   deterioration of water levels, with most significant impacts through
   localized land-use changes such as road and building construction in the
   catchments. The future of the park's sensitive ecosystems in a changing
   climate is uncertain; therefore, BNNP requires modern ecohydrological
   monitoring methods and analysis tools to improve our understanding of
   its hydrological cycle variability, and to enable us to develop adequate
   adaptation and mitigation measures. (C) 2017 The Authors. WIREs Water

Title = {Current and future socio-ecological vulnerability and adaptation of
   artisanal fisheries communities in Peru, the case of the Huaura province},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Marine artisanal fisheries make vital contributions to food security,
   livelihoods, jobs, and income in coastal communities globally. However,
   resources vary as a result of changes in oceanographic conditions such
   as sea surface temperature or wind stress, which impacts communities and
   also makes them more sensitive to other stressors such as climate
   change. In Peru, small-scale fisheries are paramount to the country's
   economy and food security. They are also one of most globally affected
   by interannual changes and potentially impacted by climate change.
   Assessing their present and future vulnerability and finding adaptation
   strategies are key to the sustainability of the sector and the
   livelihoods of many. This study assesses the local vulnerability in the
   Huaura province, Peru, where three fishing communities of very different
   socio-economic characteristics share the same fishing ground. The region
   is very sensitive to changes associated with El Nino. We assess the
   ecological and socio-economic vulnerability using governmental and local
   information, to pinpoint the main drivers of vulnerability. We find
   stark differences between communities: Carquln shows the greatest
   dependence on artisanal fishing for income and a low adaptive capacity,
   whereas Huacho, a larger and more diversified economy, presents greater
   livelihood alternatives for the artisanal fishermen. The future
   vulnerability analysis highlights the need to implement adaptation
   measures, including: economic diversification; forms to add value to the
   artisanal fishing; sustainable management of fishing grounds; and
   actions that help manage shocks from inter annual variations, such as
   monitoring and prediction systems, but also financing mechanisms that
   could attenuate the socio-economic impacts.},

Title = {A probabilistic-based framework for impact and adaptation assessment of
   climate change on hurricane damage risks and costs},
Journal = {STRUCTURAL SAFETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {173-185},
Abstract = {This paper presents a probabilistic-based framework to assess the
   potential hurricane risks to residential construction under various wind
   speed change scenarios due to potential climate change. Every year
   hurricane (cyclone) hazards cause extensive economic losses and social
   disruption around the world. Annual hurricane damage in the United
   States (US) is around \$6 billion in recent years. Hurricane intensity
   or/and frequency may change due to the increase in sea surface
   temperature as a result of climate change. Implications of the changing
   hazard patterns on hurricane risk assessment warrants an investigation
   to evaluate the potential impact of climate change. The framework
   includes probabilistic models of hurricane occurrence and intensity and
   conditional damage state probabilities (vulnerability model) for typical
   residential construction in the US, and an assessment of the
   cost-effectiveness of various climate change adaptation strategies. A
   case study of Miami-Dade County, Florida is presented to illustrate the
   framework under various scenarios of change in maximum annual wind speed
   over 50 years. Demographic information, such as median house value and
   changes in house numbers, and distribution of houses on different
   exposure, is used to estimate the time-dependent probable damage with or
   without possible climate change induced change in wind speed. This study
   shows that climate change may have a substantial impact on the damage
   and loss estimation in coastal areas, and that certain adaptation
   strategies can cost effectively decrease the damage, even if the wind
   speed does not change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {105-119},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {While reported losses of climate-related hazards are at historically
   high levels, climate change is likely to enhance the risk posed by
   extreme weather events. Several regions are likely to be exposed to
   multiple climate hazards, yet their modeling in a joint scheme is still
   at the early stages. A multi-hazard framework to map exposure to
   multiple climate extremes in Europe along the twenty-first century is
   hereby presented. Using an ensemble of climate projections, changes in
   the frequency of heat and cold waves, river and coastal flooding,
   streamflow droughts, wildfires and windstorms are evaluated.
   Corresponding variations in expected annual exposure allow for a
   quantitative comparison of hazards described by different process
   characteristics and metrics. Projected changes in exposure depict
   important variations in hazard scenarios, especially those linked to
   rising temperatures, and spatial patterns largely modulated by local
   climate conditions. Results show that Europe will likely face a
   progressive increase in overall climate hazard with a prominent spatial
   gradient towards south-western regions mainly driven by the rise of heat
   waves, droughts and wildfires. Key hotspots emerge particularly along
   coastlines and in floodplains, often highly populated and economically
   pivotal, where floods and windstorms could be critical in combination
   with other climate hazards. Projected increases in exposure will be
   larger for very extreme events due to their pronounced changes in
   frequency. Results of this appraisal provide useful input for
   forthcoming European disaster risk and adaptation policy.},

Abstract = {Urban overheating affects the energy, health, power, survivability and
   environmental quality of cities. We calculated the magnitude of
   overheating in Sydney, Australia, at close to 9 degrees C, which causes
   a cooling penalty of up to 16\% and an increase in the indoor
   overheating levels of up to 56\%. We developed and evaluated eight heat
   mitigation scenarios based on the use of reflective surfaces, additional
   greenery, an increase in the evapotranspiration rate and several
   combinations of these factors. We estimated that mitigation can decrease
   the peak ambient temperature by up to 2.9 degrees C, reduce the maximum
   annual cooling consumption by up to 1.5 TWh, decrease the CO2 emissions
   by as much as 1.21 MT CO2, reduce indoor overheating by up to 80\%,
   decrease the heat-related morbidity by 1.07-1.49, and decrease the
   heat-related mortality anomaly by as much as 1.39 per 100,000 citizens.
   We estimated the associated water penalty range to be between 80 and 100
   Gl/year or between 13 and 16.7\% of the water consumption in Sydney. (C)

Abstract = {A climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment was
   conducted in Dominica, a Caribbean small island developing state located
   in the Lesser Antilles. The assessment revealed that the country's
   population is already experiencing many impacts on health and health
   systems from climate variability and change. Infectious diseases as well
   as food and waterborne diseases pose continued threats as climate change
   may exacerbate the related health risks. Threats to food security were
   also identified, with particular concern for food production systems.
   The findings of the assessment included near-term and long-term
   adaptation options that can inform actions of health sector
   decision-makers in addressing health vulnerabilities and building
   resilience to climate change. Key challenges include the need for
   enhanced financial and human resources to build awareness of key health
   risks and increase adaptive capacity. Other small island developing
   states interested in pursuing a vulnerability and adaptation assessment
   may find this assessment approach, key findings, analysis, and lessons
   learned useful.},

Title = {A dynamic management framework for socio-ecological system stewardship:
   A case study for the United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {225},
Pages = {32-45},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {An effective and efficient stewardship of natural resources requires
   consistency across all decision-informing approaches and components
   involved, i.e., managerial, governmental, political, and legal. To
   achieve this consistency, these elements must be aligned under an
   overarching management goal that is consistent with current and
   well-accepted knowledge. In this article, we investigate the adoption by
   the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management of an environmental
   resilience-centered system that manages for resilience of marine
   ecological resources and its associated social elements. Although the
   framework is generally tailored for this Bureau, it could also be
   adapted to other federal or non-federal organizations. This paper
   presents a dynamic framework that regards change as an inherent element
   of the socio-ecological system in which management structures, e.g.,
   federal agencies, are embedded. The overall functioning of the
   management framework being considered seeks to mimic and anticipate
   environmental change in line with well-accepted elements of
   resilience-thinking. We also investigate the goal of using management
   for resilience as a platform to enhance socio-ecological sustainability
   by setting specific performance metrics embedded in pre-defined and
   desired social and/or ecological scenarios. Dynamic management
   frameworks that couple social and ecological systems as described in
   this paper can facilitate the efficient and effective utilization of
   resources, reduce uncertainty for decision and policy makers, and lead
   to more defensible decisions on resources.},

Title = {The language of risk and the risk of language: Mismatches in risk
   response in Cuban coastal villages},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Like other Caribbean countries, Cuba has adopted policies to relocate
   populations and prohibit (re)building in coastal zones at risk of
   climate change effects. Yet residents do not uniformly see such measures
   as welfare promoting and risk reducing, and may resist relocation, even
   in places where disaster planning is respected and effective. In such
   instances, vernacular narratives reveal local understandings of threats,
   vulnerabilities, and the measures taken by the state. Drawing on the
   case of Carahatas, a coastal community in Cuba, this study contrasts
   local residents' understanding of risks with those apparent in public
   policy. Results from this extensive case study (2016-2020) reveal how
   citizens resist relocation and struggle for continuity in a context of
   marginalization. Most residents are less afraid of sea level rise than
   relocation and prefer to maintain their livelihoods and traditions.
   Local voices reflect a focus on the risks of daily life. Public
   policies-based on the adaptation-resilience framework-prioritize instead
   a longer-term approach, emphasizing safety and best use of state
   resources over maintenance of existing livelihoods, settlements, and
   social networks. Understanding vernacular explanations of risk and
   disasters is crucial to develop risk reduction policy that respond to
   people's needs and expectations.},

Title = {Integrating Biophysical and Economic Assessment: Review of Nature-Based
   Adaptation to Urban Flood Extremes},
Journal = {URBAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, the potential of nature-based solutions (NBS) has
   been recognized to support climate change adaptation, by promoting
   sustainable urban planning. Nevertheless, a wider uptake of such
   solutions in urban areas faces different challenges and barriers. A
   comprehensive mapping of available NBS impact assessment methods could
   help to accelerate this process. There is, however, a lack of
   comprehensive systematization of economic analysis. This research aims
   to provide an overview of NBS impact evaluations by assessing how the
   scientific literature integrates such economic analysis into urban
   planning adaptation. A systematic review approach has been used to
   discuss the role of NBS in climate change adaptation. This review
   presents two main stages. Firstly, it identifies the
   biophysical-economic assessment of NBS adaptation measures to reduce
   urban flood extremes in coastal cities. Secondly, the NBS approaches
   were categorized based on the biophysical benefits (in terms of
   flood-risk reduction) related to each specific solution and the
   subsequent economic evaluation of such implementations. This research
   review revealed a low-level gap of integration between climate change
   issues and NBS analysis (i.e., it is commonly used as background
   condition). Most publications provide NBS biophysical impacts
   assessment, without combining these results with economic evaluation of
   the flood damages to finally achieve the avoided cost due to the
   implementation of such solutions. This work shows the growing interest
   on further research to develop spatially integrated
   environmental-economic assessment of NBS implementation, by highlighting
   the needs and opportunities of a trans-disciplinary approach to support
   policy-making in the framework of urban climate change adaptation.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change is affecting more and more local communities, which are
   now facing different hazards; in answer to this threat, specific actions
   at the local level should be taken. The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is an
   initiative that tries to involve municipalities and communities in
   developing SECAPs, i.e., plans for sustainable energy and climate with
   the aim to develop adaptation and mitigation measures. In order to
   identify and evaluate hazards, the CoM developed a template relative to
   the current risk level and expected changes in the future. This paper
   develops a methodology to fill the template using a data driven approach
   instead of a heuristic one. The methodology was applied to the city of
   Trieste in northeast Italy and uses local weather station data and
   projections obtained from GCM-RCM models. Data were manipulated using
   different approaches for current risk levels and the Mann-Kendall test
   is proposed as a method to identify the future evolution of hazard
   intensity and frequency. The results showed that the developed approach
   could help municipalities in developing their SECAPs and in identifying
   the present and future evolution of hazards.},

Abstract = {Mangroves form part of climate-change adaptation and mitigation measures
   but themselves are affected by climate change. Xuan Thuy National Park
   (XTNP) is the largest coastal wetland ecosystem in the north of Vietnam.
   Since the 1990s, several new plantings of mangroves have been
   established in the park; the dominant species used has been Kandelia
   obovata Sheue, Liu \& Yong. In this study, the current state of an 18-22
   year old plantation was examined. Kandelia obovata remains the dominant
   mangrove species. However from the sea landward, the density of trees
   decreases from 54,764 to 4,738 trees/ha. Loss of trees is linked to
   infestations by pest species of Cerambycidae, Coleoptera and Cossidae,
   Lepidoptera. A second mangrove species, Rhizophora stylosa Griff has the
   largest number of regenerating seedlings, though there is no advanced
   regeneration of any species. The potential for natural regeneration of
   K. obovata appears to be low. Loss of forest may be linked to
   climate-change phenomena. Cyclones, lightning, typhoons, and other
   extreme weather have led to stem and branch breakage and tree death, and
   indirectly to reduced resistance to pest and disease attack, leading to
   widespread degradation and loss of capacity for natural recovery to
   occur.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies in deltas and their consequence on maritime
   baselines according to UNCLOS - the case of Bangladesh and Vietnam},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {25-33},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Mekong delta in Vietnam and the Ganges/Brahmaputra River delta in
   Bangladesh are likely to be two of the deltas worst affected by climate
   change in the course of the 21st century. Due to sea level rise, and if
   significant adaptation measures are not taken, large areas of these
   low-lying coastlines could eventually become submerged. This paper will
   explore some of the consequences that climate change and sea level rise
   can have on maritime baselines and deltaic areas, according to
   publicized charts by the States involved and to the United Nations
   Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The study will argue that
   although great changes are likely to take place at the geographical
   level, due to the complex geomorphological nature of deltas and how they
   will be affected by sea level rise, these will not necessarily translate
   into changes in maritime baselines and the classification of these areas
   according to UNCLOS. Furthermore, other forms of adaptation to sea level
   rise, such as the construction of coastal defences, could turn the
   Mekong and Ganges/Brahmaputra River deltas into ``polders{''}, with
   similar characteristics and problems as the Netherlands nowadays. (c)

Abstract = {Microalgae play a pivotal role in the regulation of Earth's climate and
   its cycles, but are also affected by climate change, mainly by changes
   in temperature, light, ocean acidification, water stratification, and
   precipitation-induced nutrient inputs. The changes and impacts on
   microalgae communities are difficult to study, predict, and manage, but
   there is no doubt that there will be changes. These changes will have
   impacts beyond microalgae communities, and many of them will be
   negative. Some actions are currently ongoing for the mitigation of some
   of the negative impacts, such as harmful algal blooms and water quality,
   but global efforts for reducing CO2 emissions, temperature rises, and
   ocean acidification are paramount for reducing the impact of climate
   change on microalgae communities, and eventually, on human well-being.

Abstract = {6Climate change is known for its complexity. The fourth IPCC assessment
   report (AR4) compiles multifaceted facts and suggestions relevant for
   decision-making. This report is thus an ideal basis for educational
   activities aimed at addressing climate change comprehensively. Teaching
   an integrated view on climate change, however, requires a proper
   teaching method in order to enable students to (1) understand crucial
   climatic processes and impacts on the Earth system, (2) comprehend core
   elements of adaptation and mitigation strategies, and (3) discuss and
   even innovate strategies for different societal actors. We designed and
   applied an approach where student working groups addressed different
   aspects of the IPCC AR4 (Governance, Ocean and Coasts, Economics and
   Renewable Energy). Each group consisted of five to nine students from
   diverse backgrounds, ranging from economics and social sciences to
   environmental scientists and physicists. The groups were supervised by
   an expert scientist. The task of the groups was to prepare a
   presentation on the group's subject suitable for an interdisciplinary
   audience. External experts gave scientific and methodological background
   information. Outcomes from this one-term course comprised video films,
   presentations and material for further outreach. Students and lecturers
   shared the invaluable life experience of the difficulties of
   interdisciplinary cooperation and how to manage them.},

Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) effect is the main problem regarding a
   city's climate. It is the main adverse effect of urbanization and
   negatively affects human thermal comfort levels as defined by
   physiological equivalent temperature (PET) in the urban environment.
   Blue and green infrastructure (BGI) solutions may mitigate the UHI
   effect. First, however, it is necessary to understand the problem from
   the degrading side. The subject of this review is to identify the most
   essential geometrical, morphological, and topographical parameters of
   the urbanized environment (UE) and to understand the synergistic
   relationships between city and nature. A four-stage normative procedure
   was used, appropriate for systematic reviews of the UHI. First, one
   climate zone (temperate climate zone C) was limited to unify the design
   guidelines. As a result of delimitation, 313 scientific articles were
   obtained (546 rejected). Second, the canonical correlation analysis
   (CCA) was performed for the obtained data. Finally, our research showed
   the parameters of the UE facilities, which are necessary to mitigate the
   UHI effect. Those are building density and urban surface albedo for
   neighborhood cluster (NH), and distance from the city center, aspect
   ratio, ground surface albedo, and street orientation for street canyon
   (SC), as well as building height, material albedo, and building
   orientation for the building structure (BU). The developed guidelines
   can form the basis for microclimate design in a temperate climate. The
   data obtained from the statistical analysis will be used to create the
   blue-green infrastructure (BGI) dynamic modeling algorithm, which is the
   main focus of the future series of articles.},

Title = {I-C-SEA Change: A participatory tool for rapid assessment of

Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {44},
Number = {8},
Pages = {718-736},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present a synoptic, participatory vulnerability assessment tool to
   help identify the likely impacts of climate change and human activity in
   coastal areas and begin discussions among stakeholders on the coping and
   adaptation measures necessary to minimize these impacts. Vulnerability
   assessment tools are most needed in the tropical Indo-Pacific, where
   burgeoning populations and inequitable economic growth place even
   greater burdens on natural resources and support ecosystems. The
   Integrated Coastal Sensitivity, Exposure, and Adaptive Capacity for
   Climate Change (I-C-SEA Change) tool is built around a series of scoring
   rubrics to guide non-specialists in assigning scores to the sensitivity
   and adaptive capacity components of vulnerability, particularly for
   coral reef, seagrass, and mangrove habitats, along with fisheries and
   coastal integrity. These scores are then weighed against threat or
   exposure to climate-related impacts such as marine flooding and erosion.
   The tool provides opportunities for learning by engaging more
   stakeholders in participatory planning and group decision-making. It
   also allows for information to be collated and processed during a
   ``town-hall{''} meeting, facilitating further discussion, data
   validation, and even interactive scenario building.},

Abstract = {Consideration of abrupt climate change has generally been incorporated
   neither in analyses of climate-change impacts nor in the design of
   climate adaptation strategies. Yet the possibility of abrupt climate
   change triggered by human perturbation of the climate system is used to
   support the position of both those who urge stronger and earlier
   mitigative action than is currently being contemplated and those who
   argue that the unknowns in the Earth system are too large to justify
   such early action. This paper explores the question of abrupt climate
   change in terms of its potential implications for society, focusing on
   the UK and northwest Europe in particular. The nature of abrupt climate
   change and the different ways in which it has been defined and perceived
   are examined. Using the example of the collapse of the thermohaline
   circulation (THC), the suggested implications for society of abrupt
   climate change are reviewed; previous work has been largely speculative
   and has generally considered the implications only from economic and
   ecological perspectives. Some observations about the implications from a
   more social and behavioural science perspective are made.
   If abrupt climate change simply implies changes in the occurrence or
   intensity of extreme weather events, or an accelerated unidirectional
   change in climate, the design of adaptation to climate change can
   proceed within the existing paradigm, with appropriate adjustments.
   Limits to adaptation in some sectors or regions may be reached, and the
   costs of appropriate adaptive behaviour may be large, but strategy can
   develop on the basis of a predicted long-term unidirectional change in
   climate. It would be more challenging, however, if abrupt climate change
   implied a directional change in climate, as, for example, may well occur
   in northwest Europe following a collapse of the THC. There are two
   fundamental problems for society associated with such an outcome: first,
   the future changes in climate currently being anticipated and prepared
   for may reverse and, second, the probability of such a scenario
   occurring remains fundamentally unknown. The implications of both
   problems for climate policy and for decision making have not been
   researched. It is premature to argue therefore that abrupt climate
   change-in the sense referred to here-imposes unacceptable costs on
   society or the world economy, represents a catastrophic impact of
   climate change or constitutes a dangerous change in climate that should
   be avoided at all reasonable cost. We conclude by examining the
   implications of this contention for future research and policy
   formation.},

Abstract = {In the face of future climate change, it is prudent to seek sustainable
   adaptation strategies to address regional and local impacts. These
   impacts are multidimensional, involving interdependencies between
   systems (weather, urban land use, agriculture, etc.) that are typically
   modeled independently. To achieve a holistic understanding and thus
   identify more effective strategies for addressing and/or mitigating
   impacts, an integrated interdisciplinary research approach is essential.
   Here we discuss the broader challenges and threats faced by regions
   encompassing large bodies of water. We illustrate with North America's
   Great Lakes region, discussing how an integrated model of atmosphere,
   land, and lake could provide critical information to inform decisions.
   We stress the need to include input from diverse stakeholders in the
   development of tools to ensure the quality and usability of impact
   assessments. Research investments toward such capabilities should engage
   multiple disciplines including atmospheric sciences, hydrodynamics,
   hydrology, and biogeochemistry as well as data analytics and modeling.
   Also, detailed measurement and documentation of urban and agricultural
   land use, lake surface temperature and ice-cover, and observations of
   energy and mass exchanges at the interfaces of atmosphere, land, and
   water are needed. We envision the development of an integrated set of
   modeling tools that will improve both the utility of weather forecasts
   and long-term climate projections of the impacts on ecosystem
   sustainability, hydrometeorological extremes, engineering design, human
   health, and socioeconomic systems. Such a modeling system can serve as a
   template for other regions with cities, large lakes, inland seas, and
   coastlines facing similar kinds of climate change impacts.},

Volume = {158},
Number = {3-4},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is the use of biodiversity and
   ecosystem services as part of a strategy to help people adapt to climate
   change. Despite the potential of EbA to provide adaptation benefits,
   there is a lack of consensus on how to measure the success of this
   approach. This paper reviews the intended adaptation outcomes and
   indicators used by ongoing and completed EbA projects and addresses the
   following questions: (a) where have EbA projects been implemented? (b)
   what activities have been conducted by EbA projects? (c) what adaptation
   outcomes are EbA projects seeking to achieve? (d) how have the impacts
   of EbA projects been measured and evaluated? and (e) what is the set of
   indicators that can capture the diversity of adaptation outcomes
   achieved by EbA? To identify the adaptation outcomes provided by EbA and
   the indicators that could be used to measure such outcomes, we reviewed
   58 EbA projects implemented globally, and obtained recommendations from
   experts on what indicators should be measured. We identified 13
   adaptation outcomes that could be achieved through EbA, such as reducing
   the loss of assets of coastal communities due to extreme events. We
   identified seven indicators to monitor the success of EbA in achieving
   adaptation outcomes. Our review suggests that there is a strong need to
   better articulate the adaptation outcomes that EbA projects seek to
   achieve, to use a common set of specific indicators to track these
   outcomes, and to fund the monitoring of long-term EbA projects.},

Abstract = {An operational limited-area ocean modelling system was developed to
   supply forecasts of ocean state out to 3 days. This system is designed
   to allow non-specialist users to locate the model domain anywhere within
   the Australasian region with minimum user input. The model is required
   to produce a stable simulation every time it is invoked. This paper
   outlines the methodology used to ensure the model remains stable over
   the wide range of circumstances it might encounter. Central to the model
   configuration is an alternative approach to implementing open boundary
   conditions in a one-way nesting environment. Approximately 170
   simulations were performed on limited areas in the Australasian region
   to assess the model stability; of these, 130 ran successfully with a
   static model parameterisation allowing a statistical estimate of the
   model's approach toward instability to be determined. Based on this,
   when the model was deemed to be approaching instability a strategy of
   adaptive intervention in the form of constraint on velocity and
   elevation was invoked to maintain stability.},

Journal = {CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {100},
Number = {2},
Pages = {234-259},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Unlike several boom-and-bust fisheries of the last century, the
   recreational saltwater bass (Paralabrax spp.) fishery in southern
   California has endured oceanographic regime cycles and nearly a century
   of increasing anthropogenic impacts. We examined regulatory changes and
   several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent time series to
   determine historical influences on the fishery and causes of dramatic
   catch declines in recent years. Our results reveal a complex
   relationship between bass abundance and harvest rules, fishery
   recruitment, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), ocean regimes, and
   fishing. Recent trends in larval abundance and lengths of harvested fish
   suggest recruitment failure occurred during the last oceanographic
   regime shift coincident with a peak in exploitation rates. We believe
   this contributed to poor fishery recruitment, associated declines in
   catch-per-unit-effort, and a depressed population since the mid-2000s.
   Although long-standing regulations and periods of optimal environmental
   conditions appear to have sustained the fishery, we recommend an
   adaptive management approach to mitigate the effects of fishing pressure
   during unfavorable ocean conditions.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise amplifies flooding from tides and storms for coastal
   communities around the globe. Although the characterization of these
   physical hazards has improved, it is people's behavior that will
   ultimately determine the impact on communities. This study adds to our
   understanding of how people may respond to various adaptation options
   and policies, using a household survey in New York City, New York,
   neighborhoods affected by Hurricane Sandy. We investigate previously
   overlooked factors that may influence intended household adaptive
   behavior, such as single-action bias, a cognitive trade-off that
   households make between adaptation options, whereby taking a small (and
   often less effective measure) may strongly discourage uptake of a more
   protective measure. Through a novel application of discrete choice
   experiments in the coastal adaptation context, we simulate plausible
   future conditions to assess potential adaptation under climatic and
   nonclimatic stressors. Our findings suggest that single-action bias
   plays a substantial role in intended coastal adaptation, whereby the
   odds of homeowners who have already implemented a modest-cost measure to
   insure and relocate in the future are 66\% and 80\% lower, respectively.
   The odds of homeowners to relocate are also similar to 1.9, similar to
   2.2, and similar to 3.1 times as great if their peers relocate, nuisance
   flooding becomes a frequent occurrence, and property values fall
   substantially, respectively. We find that renters' motivation to
   relocate is largely driven more by external issues such as crime,
   gentrification, and economic security than by flood hazard.},

Abstract = {Coastal Social-Ecological Systems (SESs) are subject to several
   stresses, including climate change, that challenge fisheries and natural
   resource management. Fishers are front-line observers of changes
   occurring both on the coast and in the sea and are among the first
   people to be affected by these changes. In this study, we perform a
   meta-analysis of observations and adaptations to climate change by
   subsistence-oriented coastal fishers extracted from a global review of
   peer-reviewed and grey literature. Fishers' observations compiled from
   across the globe indicate increased temperatures and changes in weather
   patterns, as well as coastal erosion, sea level rise and shifts in
   species range and behaviours. Coastal areas offer a wide array of
   resources for diversifying livelihoods, but climate change is reducing
   these options. Specifically, climate change could reduce the resilience
   of fishers' communities, limiting options for diversification or forcing
   fishers to abandon their houses or villages.},

Abstract = {Climate change is very basic and appears on earth. Climate change has
   become an issue that must be faced by humans today and in the future.
   One of the impacts of climate change can be found in coastal areas.
   Tsunamis and tidal floods repeatedly occur in coastal areas. One of the
   efforts to overcome sea level rise that causes tsunamis, erosion, and
   tidal flooding is mangrove forests. This study aims to determine public
   awareness of the occurrence of tidal flooding and tsunami and to find an
   easy and inexpensive way to overcome it. This research is integrated
   using the partial least square (PLS) approach and the coastal
   vulnerability index (CVI) approach to mangrove forests. The results
   showed that the awareness and assessment of the community to carry out
   mangrove forest restoration to overcome disasters caused by climate
   change must be managed and handled with a co-management approach..},

Abstract = {Research on heat waves (periods of excessively hot weather, which may be
   accompanied by high humidity) is a newly emerging research topic within
   the field of climate change research with high relevance for the whole
   of society. In this study, we analyzed the rapidly growing scientific
   literature dealing with heat waves. No summarizing overview has been
   published on this literature hitherto. We developed a suitable search
   query to retrieve the relevant literature covered by the Web of Science
   (WoS) as complete as possible and to exclude irrelevant literature (n =
   8,011 papers). The time evolution of the publications shows that
   research dealing with heat waves is a highly dynamic research topic,
   doubling within about 5 years. An analysis of the thematic content
   reveals the most severe heat wave events within the recent decades (1995
   and 2003), the cities and countries/regions affected (USA, Europe, and
   Australia), and the ecological and medical impacts (drought, urban heat
   islands, excess hospital admissions, and mortality). An alarming finding
   is that the limit for survivability may be reached at the end of the
   twenty-first century in many regions of the world due to the fatal
   combination of rising temperatures and humidity levels measured as
   ``wet-bulb temperature{''} (WBT). Risk estimation and future strategies
   for adaptation to hot weather are major political issues. We identified
   104 citation classics, which include fundamental early works of research
   on heat waves and more recent works (which are characterized by a
   relatively strong connection to climate change).},

Title = {Fishers' local knowledge on impact of climate change and anthropogenic
   interferences on Hilsa fishery in South Asia: evidence from Bangladesh},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {The anadromous fish species Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) constitutes the
   largest single fishery in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. River
   Meghna is the important habitat for Hilsa as the major breeding and
   nursing grounds are situated along this portion of the river. In this
   paper, we investigate fishers' perceptions on effect of climate change
   and anthropogenic impact on Hilsa fishery at lower Meghna. Fishers'
   ecological knowledge indicates that the stock of Hilsa is declining due
   to several adverse climatic conditions such as increased water
   temperature, salinity intrusion and low freshwater discharge from
   upstream. Fishers believe that dams and polders have immense effect on
   river sedimentation which already blockade several upward migratory
   route of Hilsa. Fishers' experience shows that intensity of coastal
   cyclone is gradually increasing, which causes severe physical and
   economical damage. The study also indicates that the major constraints
   to adopt with the change situation are low level of human capital and
   restricted access to the formal credit system. Therefore, incorporation
   of local knowledge in governmental policy formulation and public support
   to improve human skill are essential for the adaptive management.},

Title = {Vulnerability to Water Shortage Under Current and Future Water
   Supply-Demand Conditions Across US River Basins},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change, population growth, urbanization, and interactions
   thereof may alter the water supply-demand balance and lead to shifts in
   water shortage characteristics at different timescales. This study
   proposes an approach to improve the vulnerability assessments of U.S.
   river basins to the shortage at the interannual to decadal timescales by
   characterizing shifts in intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) of
   water shortage events from current (1986-2015) to future (2070-2099)
   periods. The results indicate that under the driest future climate
   projection, the frequency and intensity of over-year (D > 12 months)
   events at the monthly scale and decadal (D > 10 years) events at the
   annual scale tend to increase in the Southwest, Southern, middle Great
   Plain, and Great Lakes regions. Conversely, the frequency of interannual
   (D < 12 months) events at the monthly scale and annual (D > 1 year) and
   multi-year (D > 3 years) events at the annual scale is likely to
   increase in the West Coast regions. Besides, river basins with a higher
   rate of aridification are likely to experience more frequent over-year
   (D > 12 months) events, while river basins with a decrease in
   aridification were projected to undergo more frequent interannual (D <
   12 months) events due to an increase in the variability of extreme
   weather anomalies within a year. The findings of this study provide new
   insights to understand and characterize vulnerability to water shortage
   under current and future water supply-demand conditions and can inform
   the development of effective mitigation and/or adaptation strategies.
   Plain Language Summary Water Shortage is an inevitable and complex
   phenomenon that has plagued civilization throughout history. Future
   changes in climate and population may cause a decrease in freshwater
   availability and an increase in water demand leading to more frequent
   water shortage conditions. The enhanced characterizations of changes in
   water shortage conditions from interannual to decadal events are
   requisite to the appropriate management and planning of future water
   resources, and improved implementation of regional adaptation and
   mitigation strategies under significant shifts in water supply-demand
   balances. We proposed an approach to assess how shifts in the
   demand-supply balance can alter the intensity, duration, and frequency
   of water shortage conditions at the monthly and annual scales. The
   findings reveal that under the driest future climate projection for the
   United States river basins, prolonged water shortage conditions in drier
   basins and interannual water shortage events in wetter basins are likely
   to be the main concerns in the future and should gain more attention in
   the water resource planning and management.},

   establishing a clear connection to translate the vulnerability and risk
   assessment results into adequate target-oriented risk reduction
   measures, trying to bridge the gap between science and management for

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-68},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis tool, the Taihu
   Basin Risk Assessment System (TBRAS), is developed to perform scenario
   analysis of future flood risk changes in the Taihu Basin. The TBRAS
   integrates modules of climate modelling, hydrological and hydraulic
   modelling, dyke reliability analysis, socioeconomic analysis, and damage
   assessment. The results indicate that the TBRAS can provide a
   broad-scale simulation of the flooding processes and damage evaluation
   for the entire Taihu Basin. Future climate change by 2050 in
   precipitation alone can approximately result in four or five times of
   risk increase compared with the 2005 baseline risk. Socioeconomic
   changes alone can increase flood risk by four to six times. The paper
   reveals that, without any proactive responses, the combination of
   socioeconomic change, sea-level rise, and other climate changes can
   substantially increase the overall flood risks to 1537 times of the
   present situation. We therefore conclude that both structural and
   non-structural measures for reducing flood risks are required and
   provide a set of response options for managing and adapting future flood
   risk changes.},

Title = {The two-speed coastal climate adaptation economy in Australia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {190},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {There is increasing global concern that climate adaptation efforts are
   falling behind the increasing risks associated with climate change. A
   number of reviews have identified this general issue in multiple nations
   and jurisdictions. In Australia, it is argued here that adaptation of
   the coastal built environment is operating at two speeds: the two-speed
   adaptation economy. Large civil assets and facilities in Australia now
   mostly have adaptation plans and strategies in place; although progress
   in actual on-the-ground implementation is variable in some cases. By
   contrast, adaptation of coastal communities and settlements continues at
   a very slow pace with very few specific adaptation measures being
   implemented that were not already being implemented as business as usual
   for flood or erosion management. The reasons for these differences in
   adaptation progress is investigated here. A key outcome of the thinking
   presented here is the reinforcement of the result that adaptation of
   coastal communities is not a challenge of relocating buildings, but
   rather a challenge of incentivising and supporting communities to act.},

Abstract = {A system-level perspective of exploited marine and coastal ecosystems
   provides insight into cross-scale dynamics and potential conflicts
   between sectors operating within the same region. Such insights are a
   necessary part of adaptive management, as conflict and `surprise'
   outcomes of interactions between processes operating on different scales
   could undermine the intent of management actions taken in support of
   sustainable development. Agent-based models provide one means of
   obtaining the desired system perspective. These types of models are one
   of the few platforms that can deal with the large number of scales and
   processes that can drive the alternative states that socioecological
   systems can take. By defining individual-based approaches and both
   differential and discrete equation-based formulations as agents
   sufficient flexibility is provided to create cross-scale whole-of-system
   models that can include biophysical, social and economic drivers and
   interactions. This combination of agent types and the resulting
   flexibility has provided essential for identifying trade-offs between
   sectors, identifying ``unintended consequences{''} and supporting the
   implementation of adaptive management in the Ningaloo Reef - Exmouth
   system of Western Australia.},

Abstract = {Risk of impact of marine fishes to fishing and climate change (including
   ocean acidification) depend on the species' ecological and biological
   characteristics, as well as their exposure to over-exploitation and
   climate hazards. These human-induced hazards should be considered
   concurrently in conservation risk assessment. In this study, we aim to
   examine the combined contributions of climate change and fishing to the
   risk of impacts of exploited fishes, and the scope for climate-risk
   reduction from fisheries management. We combine fuzzy logic expert
   system with species distribution modeling to assess the extinction risks
   of climate and fishing impacts of 825 exploited marine fish species
   across the global ocean. We compare our calculated risk index with
   extinction risk of marine species assessed by the International Union
   for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Our results show that 60\% (499
   species) of the assessed species are projected to experience very high
   risk from both overfishing and climate change under a
   ``business-as-usual{''} scenario (RCP 8.5 with current status of
   fisheries) by 2050. The risk index is significantly and positively
   related to level of IUCN extinction risk (ordinal logistic regression, p
   < 0.0001). Furthermore, the regression model predicts species with very
   high risk index would have at least one in five (>20\%) chance of having
   high extinction risk in the next few decades (equivalent to the IUCN
   categories of vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered). Areas
   with more at-risk species to climate change are in tropical and
   subtropical oceans, while those that are at risk to fishing are
   distributed more broadly, with higher concentration of at-risk species
   in North Atlantic and South Pacific Ocean. The number of species with
   high extinction risk would decrease by 63\% under the sustainable
   fisheries-low emission scenario relative to the ``business-as-usual{''}
   scenario. This study highlights the substantial opportunities for
   climate-risk reduction through effective fisheries management.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the socio-ecological changes perceived by the
   X-hamlet local community in Bangka Island before and after the spread of
   large-scale fin mining and how it adapted to those changes. Using
   evidence collected by household surveys, combined with key informant
   interviews and focus group discussions, this study shows that the spread
   of fin mining activity on large and small scales were perceived
   differently by subsistence groups within this hamlet as a key driver of
   coastal ecosystem and land tenure system changes, leading to income
   uncertainty. The household economic conditions, resource availability,
   relationships, and networking are important factors influencing
   household decisions on diversifying income sources. Nonetheless, the
   lack of capital (physical, financial, human), limited skill, and low
   education levels constrained to them in diversifying their income
   sources. Thus, landless households are facing a greater challenge in
   adapting, particularly fishers who are facing ongoing fish depletion
   yields due to suction dredger and small-scale coastal mining. The
   landless fishers are potentially marginalized by engaging in mining
   activity which is an economical, socially, and environmentally
   unsustainable alternative livelihood. Therefore, future policies need to
   address those key issues for securing local's lives and livelihoods.},

Title = {APRICOIN: An Adaptive Approach for Prioritizing High-Risk Containers
   Inspections},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {18238-18249},
Abstract = {Risk evaluation of the containers remains a difficult task, often due to
   incomplete or ambiguous information on containers. In addition, the
   evaluation process needs to be adapted on an ongoing basis to cope with
   emerging risk factors. Furthermore, high-risk container inspection is
   commonly hindered by a low inspection capacity, which leads to a major
   issue: how can we prioritize the container inspection if the number of
   suspect containers exceeds the inspection capacity? Container inspection
   prioritizing may be the answer. In this paper, we propose a novel
   approach for adaptively prioritizing container inspection (APRICOIN).
   First, we enhance the container information flow to alleviate the
   problem of incomplete information by proposing an enhanced container
   descriptive. Second, we introduce the APRICOIN algorithm, which combines
   frequent pattern mining and a fuzzy logic system, to assess the
   container's risk score. The frequent pattern growth algorithm is
   proposed to retrieve the key criteria for evaluating container risk.
   This is done through mining frequent criteria sets within the historic
   data set of container inspections by customs. The mined frequent
   criteria sets are used to assess fuzzy inference rules which are
   periodically readjusted to integrate new key criteria. Thereafter, the
   fuzzy logic system uses the obtained fuzzy inference rules to calculate
   a container's risk score. Our major contribution consists of providing a
   new adaptive approach for assessing a container's risk through combining
   frequent criteria mining and fuzzy logic. An illustrative study and a
   comparison with alternative approaches are performed to validate the
   proposed algorithm.},

Abstract = {For many power generation systems, it is extremely important to control
   the likelihood as well as the consequences of potential risks during
   actual operation. Operational risks may result in substantial costs of
   repair or replacement, significant losses of power production, and
   catastrophic safety hazards to personnel or infrastructure. The
   selection of an appropriate strategy to mitigate the operational risks
   is a very complex and critical task for the offshore wind energy sector.
   In recent years, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches have
   gained momentum in this field. The aim of this paper is to propose a
   decision model based on Analytic Network Process (ANP) technique in
   order to select the best ``risk mitigation strategy{''} for offshore
   wind infrastructures. The proposed model consists of a number of
   alternatives (e.g., variation of offshore site layout, improvement of
   maintenance services, upgrading the control and monitoring systems, and
   modification in design of wind turbine sub-assemblies) among which the
   decision maker has to select, on the basis of a finite set of criteria
   (e.g., safety, added value, cost, and feasibility). The model developed
   is applied to an offshore wind farm consisting of 30 wind turbines of 2
   MW. Our findings indicate that ``improving the repair and maintenance
   services{''} is chosen to be the most cost-effective approach for
   mitigating the operational risks of offshore wind infrastructures.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change
   (CC) with higher temperatures reducing crop yields and sea level rise
   decreasing arable land supply. The Government of Bangladesh aspires to
   offer its people a comparable standard of living to that of
   middle-income countries by 2021. Bangladesh's population will reach 247
   million by 2050 and GDP is projected to grow annually by 7.9\%. With
   increasing population density, greater demand for resources, and CC
   impacts, adaptation and mitigation strategies will be required for
   agricultural output to meet growing food demand. We develop a dynamic
   computable general equilibrium model linked with a food security module
   to explore CC impacts on agriculture and food security. Although CC
   impacts had a relatively small effect on GDP, reducing it by \$29,925
   million Taka (-0.11\%) by 2030, agricultural sector impacts were felt
   more acutely, reducing output by -1.23\%, increasing imports by 1.52\%,
   and reducing total caloric consumption by 17\%, with some households
   remaining underfed due to inequitable food distribution. Evidence
   generated here can guide policy to ensure economic growth contributes to
   meeting national development and food security targets.},

Title = {Local adaptive capacity to climate change in mountainous agricultural
   areas in the eastern Mediterranean (Lebanon)},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {The potential capacity of an agricultural community to adapt to climate
   change is directly related to several indicators, mainly the initial
   state of local farmers' perceptions to climate and adaptation, the
   socio-economy, the space and biophysical characteristics, the
   institutional efficiency, and the technological aspects. Adaptive
   capacity reflects directly on the ease or difficulty of the current and
   future adaptation processes of a system. In this study, the adaptive
   capacity in mountain agriculture is weighed in 4 different zones of
   Mount-Lebanon on the East coast of the Mediterranean Sea, one of the
   most vulnerable hot spots to climate change worldwide. The assessment
   was based on a multi-criteria analysis of the key indicators of local
   adaptive capacity, assisted by a survey conducted on 378 farmers (apple
   growers) in the study area consisting of 24 villages grouped in 4
   clusters. Results show that, while presenting a variation between the 4
   clusters, the local adaptive capacity is weak and less than the average
   for the concerned area of study in general. None of the considered zones
   concurrently had the highest score for all the assessed criteria and
   each cluster had its own strong potency indicators. The overall
   comparative approach reveals that the local potential for adaptation to
   climate change in agriculture, specifically apple growing, is the
   highest in the Bcharreh cluster area compared to the three other
   clusters of Aqoura, Mayrouba and Jouar el Hoz.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Hypothetical models in the scientific literature suggest that ecosystem
   restoration and creation sites follow a smooth path of development
   (called a trajectory), rapidly matching natural reference sites (the
   target). Multi-million-dollar mitigation agreements have been based on
   the expectation that damages to habitat will be compensated within 5-10
   years, and monitoring periods have been set accordingly. Our San Diego
   Bay study site, the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, has one
   of the longest and most detailed records of habitat development at a
   mitigation site: data on soil organic matter, soil nitrogen, plant
   growth, and plant canopies for up to 10 years from a 12-year-old site.
   High interannual variation and lack of directional changes indicate
   little chance that targets will be reached in the near future. Other
   papers perpetuate the trajectory model, despite data that corroborate
   our findings. After reviewing ``trajectory models{''} and presenting our
   comprehensive data for the first time, we suggest alternative management
   and mitigation policies.},

Title = {Accelerating sustainable ocean policy: The dynamics of multiple
   stakeholder priorities and actions for oceans and human health},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The ocean is under increasing pressure from climate change, biodiversity
   loss, and further degradation through human impacts, resulting in
   unpredictable, uneven and uncertain outcomes for society including
   varied risks for human health. This calls for a shift from policies with
   a local level perspective or narrow focus to `ocean policy' that takes
   all the marine environments in their totality into consideration,
   requiring dynamic strategies and adaptive management. Oceans and Human
   Health (OHH) is emerging as one way to address such complex shifts in a
   holistic way. This requires new forms of collaboration, participation
   and joint-action by multiple stakeholders across domains. OHH presents
   an opportunity for a new way of understanding interrelationships with
   the ocean, humanising environmental crises. Through a highly
   participatory process with expert and citizen stakeholders, a
   meta-analysis of priorities and actions for sustainable ocean policy in
   Europe are presented. Causal processes that drive ocean and human health
   dynamics are highlighted and priority themes and actions from
   stakeholder discussions are presented that provide key insights for
   policy and decision-making processes. The participatory-based approach
   presented in this paper can provide the means to make these
   interdependent processes visible by offering insights to better
   understand the behaviour of complex systems, such as ocean health and
   public health. Understanding these dynamic interactions can help
   accelerate the progress of policy and management that is integrated and
   adaptive. Findings demonstrate the value for society in building
   capacity to better understand the current and future synergies and
   interlinkages between climate change, ocean health and human health and
   wellbeing.},

Title = {ATTITUDES OF GREEK UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TOWARDS ENERGY AND THE
   ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {This paper summarises the results of a survey carried out amongst the
   student population of one of the largest Greek Technological Educational
   Institutes. It explores attitudes toward the environment in general and
   then, more specifically, toward global warming and global
   warming-mitigation technologies. It also explores student understanding
   of sources of carbon dioxide and climate change-mitigation technologies,
   such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Further, it analyses
   responses to questions about willingness of respondents to pay to solve
   global warming. The data was collected in October and November of 2011
   using a structured questionnaire which was first formulated in English
   and then translated into Greek. The analysis was performed using the
   statistical package SPSS v17.0 and focused on descriptive statistics, in
   order to compare the average ratings for the different statements.
   The present study concludes that university students in Greece are
   overwhelmingly positively disposed towards the environment with the
   majority of respondents believing that protecting the environment should
   have priority over economic considerations. Students also view the
   effects of global warming as serious enough to warrant action and state
   their belief that the current generation should meet its own needs
   without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
   own. Moreover, the majority of the participants are against the
   development of nuclear energy, favoring RES (solar wind and bioenergy),
   and energy conservation technologies. However, the study has also
   identified a lack of understanding in regards to sources of carbon
   dioxide. The majority of the respondents do not seem to know that oceans
   act as sinks of CO2 emissions or that the housing stock is a significant
   contributor to this problem.},

Abstract = {To address the problems of the traditional A{*} algorithm in solving
   paths with many expansion nodes, high memory overhead, low operation
   efficiency, and many path corners, this paper improved the traditional
   A{*} algorithm by combining jump point search strategy and adaptive arc
   optimization strategy. Firstly, to improve the safety of our paths, the
   risk area of the obstacles was expanded. Then, the A{*} algorithm was
   combined with the jump point search strategy to achieve the subnode jump
   search, reducing the calculation scale and memory overhead, and
   improving search efficiency. Considering the influence of the density of
   obstacles on search efficiency, the heuristic function was enhanced
   according to the special effects of the density of obstacles. Finally,
   the redundant jump point and adaptive arc optimization strategies were
   used to shorten the path length further and enhance the initial path's
   smoothness. Simulation results showed that our algorithm outperforms
   traditional A{*} and literature algorithms in path length, security, and
   smoothness, and then was further validated and applied in large-scale
   marine environments and realistic settings.},

Title = {Paralytic Shellfish Toxins and Ocean Warming: Bioaccumulation and
   Ecotoxicological Responses in Juvenile Gilthead Seabream (Sparus aurata)},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Warmer seawater temperatures are expected to increase harmful algal
   blooms (HABs) occurrence, intensity, and distribution. Yet, the
   potential interactions between abiotic stressors and HABs are still
   poorly understood from ecological and seafood safety perspectives. The
   present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the
   bioaccumulation/depuration mechanisms and ecotoxicological responses of
   juvenile gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) exposed to paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PST) under different temperatures (18, 21, 24 degrees
   C). PST were detected in fish at the peak of the exposure period (day
   five, 0.22 mu g g(-1) N-sulfocarbamoylGonyautoxin-1-2 (C1 and C2), 0.08
   mu g g(-1) Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and 0.18 mu g g(-1)
   Gonyautoxin-5 (B1)), being rapidly eliminated (within the first 24 h of
   depuration), regardless of exposure temperature. Increased temperatures
   led to significantly higher PST contamination (275 mu g STX eq. kg(-1)).
   During the trial, fish antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide
   dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; glutathione S-transferase, GST) in both
   muscle and viscera were affected by temperature, whereas a significant
   induction of heat shock proteins (HSP70), Ubiquitin (Ub) activity
   (viscera), and lipid peroxidation (LPO; muscle) was observed under the
   combination of warming and PST exposure. The differential
   bioaccumulation and biomarker responses observed highlight the need to
   further understand the interactive effects between PST and abiotic
   stressors, to better estimate climate change impacts on HABs events, and
   to develop mitigation strategies to overcome the potential risks
   associated with seafood consumption.},

Abstract = {Transportation system performance in response to natural and man-made
   disasters is commonly referred to as resilience. Transportation system
   resilience has always been a major concern. In previous disasters, such
   as Hurricane Katrina, the resilience of intermodal transportation
   systems has proved to be a vital part of disaster response and
   restoration of the influenced area. Thus, effective methods for the
   enhancement of intermodal transportation system resilience are
   necessary. It is a well-known fact that freight transport, a key part of
   economic development, is heavily influenced by disruption of intermodal
   transportation. For this reason, the main focus of this research is
   freight transport. The objective of this paper is to propose strategies
   for improving the measure of resilience (MOR) for intermodal
   transportation system and measure their effectiveness. To accomplish
   this goal, the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which was seriously damaged in
   Hurricane Katrina, was selected as a case study. Level of Service, a
   resilience indicator easily understood by the public, was used as a
   standard for measuring MOR for the intermodal transportation system.
   Because the impact of disaster to MOR is not significant, rerouting was
   proposed as an improvement strategy and its effectiveness is evaluated
   using a simple yet efficient approach. For this study, results showed
   that rerouting is a valid method for the improvement of MOR and that
   diversion delay is significant. In the future, rerouting could be
   adopted by government agencies as an effective strategy to alleviate the
   impact of unanticipated disasters.},

Abstract = {Sustainable tourism has been defined as a type of tourism that
   incorporates the principles of sustainable development, i.e. considering
   not only the economic but also the social and environmental bottom line.
   Recently, the idea of the triple bottom line has been expanded to a
   quadniple bottom line including climatic considerations. Climate change
   is a global phenomenon that will shape the future of tourism in largely
   unknown ways. As a contributor to climate change, tourism can actively
   lower the extent of climate change through mitigation. Next to
   supply-side mitigation measures to design less energy-intensive and more
   energy-efficient tourism offers, demand-side perspectives play a
   critical role as tourists directly and indirectly contribute to the
   extent of mitigation through their consumption and behavioral practices.
   The paper is part of a PhD project contributing to the discussion on
   demand focused climate change mitigation in the vacation context. It
   explores whether there are tourists that behave more climate friendly or
   whether climate friendly behavior has to be encouraged explicitly in the
   vacation context. The former case raises the question how climate
   friendly tourists can be identified and targeted. In the latter case,
   tourism providers like to know how to encourage climate friendly
   behavior of tourists. The discussion focuses primarily on the first part
   of these questions. The author refers to the literature on the topic and
   to findings of a scoping study undertaken with tourists to the Slovenian
   coast. The aim of this paper is to stimulate discussion and further
   research in order to improve strategies for sustainable tourism.},

Title = {Stakeholder Perspectives on Opportunities and Challenges in Achieving
   Sustainable Growth of the Blue Economy in a Changing Climate},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Coastal marine environments provide livelihoods as billions of people
   around the world depend greatly on sustainability efforts in the Blue
   Economy. In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important
   Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the
   impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the
   Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder
   workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector,
   science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important
   issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy
   and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews
   with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and
   validate the most important issues identified during the first stage,
   and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants
   identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine
   environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear
   focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary
   approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the
   climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive,
   depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions
   and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the
   Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects.
   Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or
   intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater
   influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our
   study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North
   Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects
   on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and
   political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue
   Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much
   stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more
   flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the
   changing environmental, social and economic realities.},

Title = {Economic valuation of climate change-induced mortality: age dependent
   cold and heat mortality in the Netherlands},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {162},
Number = {2},
Pages = {545-562},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study examines the impacts of climate change on future mortality in
   the Netherlands and the related economic costs. Our methods account for
   changes in both cold- and heat-related mortality for different age
   classes, the time dynamics associated with temperature-related
   mortality, demographic change and the urban heat island effect. Results
   show that heat and cold impacts on mortality vary considerably between
   age classes, with older people being more vulnerable to temperature
   extremes. The sensitivity of mortality to temperature is higher on hot
   (4.6\%/degrees C) than cold (2.1\%/degrees C) days for the most
   vulnerable group (>= 80 years), and extreme temperatures have long time
   lags on mortality, especially in the cold. A main finding is that
   climate change is expected to first decrease total net mortality in the
   Netherlands due to a dominant effect of less cold-related mortality, but
   this reverses over time under high warming scenarios, unless additional
   adaptation measures are taken. The economic valuation of these total net
   mortality changes indicates that climate change will result in net
   benefits of up to euro2.3 billion using the Value of a Statistical Life
   Year and euro14.5 billion using the Value of a Statistical Life
   approaches in 2050, while this changes over time in net economic costs
   under high warming scenarios that can reach up to euro17.6 billion in
   2085. Implementing adaptation policies that reduce the negative impacts
   of warming on mortality in the heat can turn these net costs into net
   benefits by achieving a continued dominating effect of reduced mortality
   in the cold.},

Title = {Projections of salt intrusion in a mega-delta under climatic and
   anthropogenic stressors},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Rising temperatures, rapid urbanization and soaring demand for natural
   resources threaten deltas worldwide and make them vulnerable to rising
   seas, subsidence, droughts, floods, and salt intrusion. However, climate
   change projections in deltas often address climate-driven stressors in
   isolation and disregard parallel anthropogenic processes, leading to
   insufficient socio-political drive. Here, using a combination of
   process-based numerical models that integrate both climatic and
   anthropogenic environmental stressors, we project salt intrusion within
   the Mekong mega-Delta, in the next three decades. We assess the relative
   effects of various drivers and show that anthropogenic forces such as
   groundwater extraction-induced subsidence and riverbed level incisions
   due to sediment starvation can increase the salinity-affected areas by
   10-27\% compared to the present-day situation, while future sea level
   rise adds another 6-19\% increase. These projections provide crucial
   input for adaptation policy development in the Mekong Delta and the
   methodology inspires future systemic studies of environmental changes in
   other deltas. Human activities, such as groundwater extraction and
   sediment starvation, are projected to add to climatic factors like sea
   level rise to exacerbate saline water intrusion into the Mekong Delta,
   Vietnam over the next 30 years, according to process-based model
   simulations.},

Title = {Globalisation and Climate Change in Asia: the urban health impact},
Journal = {THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1339-1356},
Abstract = {Asia's economic development successes will create new policy areas to
   address, as the advances made through globalisation create greater
   climate change challenges, particularly the impact on urban health.
   Poverty eradication and higher standards of living both increase demand
   on resources. Globalisation increases inequalities and those who are
   currently the losers will carry the greatest burden of the costs in the
   form of the negative effects of climate change and the humanitarian
   crises that will ensue. Of four major climate change challenges
   affecting the environment and health, two-urban air pollution and waste
   management-can be mitigated by policy change and technological
   innovation if sufficient resources are allocated. Because of the urban
   bias in the development process, these challenges will probably register
   on policy makers' agenda. The second two major challenges-floods and
   drought-are less amenable to policy and technological solutions: many
   humanitarian emergency challenges lie ahead. This article describes the
   widely varying impact of both globalisation and climate change across
   Asia. The greatest losers are those who flee one marginal location, the
   arid inland areas, only to settle in another marginal location in the
   flood prone coastal slums. Effective preparation is required, and an
   effective response when subsequent humanitarian crises occur.},

Title = {Urban heat island mitigation in Singapore: Evaluation using
   WRF/multilayer urban canopy model and local climate zones},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mitigation and adaption measures must be designed strategically by urban
   planners, designers, and decision-makers to reduce urban heat island
   (UHI) related risks. We employed the Weather Research and Forecasting
   (WRF) model to assess UHI mitigation scenarios for the tropical city of
   Singapore during April 2016, including two heat wave periods. The local
   climate zones for Singapore were used as the land use/land cover data to
   account for the intra-urban variability. The simulations show that the
   canopy layer UHI intensity in Singapore can reach up to 5 degrees C in
   compact areas during nighttime. The results reveal that city-scale
   deployment of cool roofs can provide an overall reduction of 1.3 degrees
   C in the near-surface daytime air temperature in large lowrise areas.
   Increasing the thermostat set temperature to 25 degrees C from 21
   degrees C in city-wide buildings can potentially reduce the air
   temperature due to less (similar to 20\%) waste heat discharge from
   airconditioning units. A densification scenario considering an increase
   from approximately 7 841 people/km(2) (2016) to 9040-9,600 people/km(2)
   (2030) under the current climate leads to air temperature increase of
   1.4 degrees C, which demonstrates the importance of limiting the
   densification of less compact areas in maintaining thermal comfort in
   the future.},

Title = {Explaining communities' adaptation strategies for coastal flood risk:
   Vulnerability and institutional factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Increasing coastal flood risk has prompted a proliferation of cities
   that are adopting risk reduction and adaptation tools. This article
   inquires into what types of tools local governments tend to adopt for
   managing coastal flood risk and the factors that may be influencing
   these choices; in particular, factors related to hazard vulnerability
   and institutional capacity. Focusing on 40 diverse coastal communities
   in a study region in Canada, the study utilised data from the
   communities' Official Community Plans to characterise their approaches
   to managing coastal flood risk in terms of land use regulations,
   construction specifications, and/or structural flood protection tools.
   The data revealed considerable diversity in the portfolio of tools that
   the communities have adopted. Tool adoption was found to correlate
   strongly with hazard vulnerability; that is, communities with similar
   physical and socio-economic vulnerability conditions tended to take
   similar adaptation actions. For example, established communities with
   highly urbanised coastlines tended to rely on structural flood
   protection while suburban communities with semi-developed coastlines
   predominantly utilised land use regulations. Institutional factors such
   as resource availability and local leadership, which were
   operationalised using survey data, exhibited surprisingly little
   correlation with the types of tools that communities adopted.},

Abstract = {Progressive salinization of water and soil will be increasingly severe
   in low-lying coastal areas as climate change proceeds. Thus,
   understanding the economic impacts of salinity intrusion will be
   essential for effective adaptation planning. This paper uses econometric
   analysis to predict the impact of climate-induced increases in soil
   salinity on high-yielding-variety rice production in coastal Bangladesh.
   Findings indicate an output decline of 15.6 percent in nine subdistricts
   where soil salinity will exceed 4 deciSiemens per meter before 2050.
   Without new adaptation strategies, the predicted changes will result in
   7.7 and 5.6 percent losses in the Barisal and Chittagong regions,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {The Muslim pilgrimage or Hajj, which is one of the five pillars of
   Muslim faith, takes place outdoors in and surrounding Mecca in the Saudi
   Arabian desert. The U.S. National Weather Service defines an extreme
   danger heat stress threshold which is approximately equivalent to a
   wet-bulb temperature of about 29.1 degrees C-a combined measure of
   temperature and humidity. Here, based on results of simulations using an
   ensemble of coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models, we project
   that future climate change with and without mitigation will elevate heat
   stress to levels that exceed this extreme danger threshold through 2020
   and during the periods of 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, with increasing
   frequency and intensity as the century progresses. If climate change
   proceeds on the current trajectory or even on a trajectory with
   considerable mitigation, aggressive adaptation measures will be required
   during years of high heat stress risk.
   Plain Language Summary The Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca
   in the Saudi Arabian desert. In this study, we project an increase in
   the frequency and intensity of future extreme danger heat stress events
   in Mecca during Hajj under both business as usual and mitigation
   scenarios.},

Title = {A metric of indicators and factors for assessing livelihood
   preparedness: A systematic review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {People's livelihoods are often disrupted or decimated by natural
   hazards. Preparing for sustainable livelihood is therefore of paramount
   importance in reducing the impacts of disruptive shocks and stresses.
   Through a systematic review of literature, this paper aims to identify
   the indicators for measuring livelihood preparedness and the factors
   that influence them. Analysis of 66 included publications showed that
   existing studies published between 2000 and 2019 have largely focused on
   discussion of four indicators of livelihood preparedness: 1)
   accessibility to resources, 2) level of livelihood diversity, 3)
   individual adaptive capacity, and 4) effectiveness of individual
   disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures. These indicators form the basis
   of our proposed livelihood preparedness factor metric, which promotes
   the development of methodologies for investigating the determinants in
   context-dependent livelihood readiness assessment while highlighting the
   directions for disaster risk reduction (DRR) policymakers and
   individuals in the design and management of livelihood support
   activities for people living in hazard-prone areas.},

Abstract = {We investigated the perceived effects of salinity on farming practices,
   income, and challenges for crop production in Blang Nibong village in
   North Aceh, Indonesia. We surveyed 120 smallholder farmers chosen in
   consultation with local leaders considering their agricultural
   activities and salinity susceptibility. Farmers' perceptions of major
   crop production constraints (e.g., salinity) and potential adaptation
   strategies were assessed using open and closed questions. The study
   revealed that farmers in the study region primarily grew rain-fed rice
   using traditional monoculture. Salinity was identified as the primary
   crop production constraint by all respondents, resulting in plant
   mortality, decreased soil health and water quality, limited plant
   growth, and low yields. Additionally, salinity has reduced the arable
   area (>0.5 ha), resulting in lower total production. The implications of
   the salinity were further corroborated by the low farmers' income. In
   fact, farming activities are not contributing positively to farmers'
   income as the results revealed off-farm activities (77\%) as the main
   source of income. Based on the farmer's current activities to overcome
   salinity problems on their farms, they were clustered into adaptive and
   non-adaptive farmers. The non-adaptive group prefers to convert their
   land to pasture (81\%), whereas the adaptive group prefers to improve
   the irrigation system (77\%).},

Pages = {335-357},

Abstract = {Climate change, ocean acidification (OA) and the subsequent changes in
   marine productivity may affect fisheries and eventually the whole
   economy in the Arctic. We analysed how changes in climate and ocean pH
   under scenarios of anthropogenic CO2 emissions are likely to affect the
   economics of marine fisheries in the Arctic. We applied a Dynamic
   Bioclimate Envelope Model (DBEM) and outputs from four different Earth
   System Models (ESMs) to project future changes in the distribution and
   maximum catch potential of exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. We
   projected that total fisheries revenue in the Arctic region may increase
   by 39\% (14-59\%) by 2050 relative to 2000 under the Special Reports on
   Emission Scenario (SRES) A2. Simultaneously, total fishing costs,
   fishers' incomes, household incomes and economy-wide impacts in the
   Arctic are also projected to increase. Climate change with OA is
   expected to reduce the potential increases in catch and the economic
   indicators studied herein. Although the projections suggest that Arctic
   countries are likely to be `winners' under climate change in comparison
   with tropical developing countries, the effects of OA will lower the
   expected future benefits in the Arctic. The predicted impacts are likely
   to be conservative as we consider only the direct effects of OA on
   fishes and calcifiers, of which there are only a few in the Arctic.
   Results of this study would be useful for designing effective adaptation
   strategies to climate change and measures to mitigate the potential
   negative impacts of OA in the Arctic.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The global need for healthy and safe open spaces faces continuous
   temperature rise due to the heat island phenomenon and climate change.
   This problem requires new strategies for improving the habitability of
   open spaces (indoor and outdoor conditions in buildings). These
   techniques include reducing solar radiation, reducing the temperature of
   surrounding surfaces, and reducing the air temperature. The radiant
   solutions are essential for outdoor comfort, both in summer and in
   winter. They are easy to integrate into open spaces. This study explores
   a new concept of radiant solutions adapted for outdoor spaces. The
   solution was evaluated in a test cell to obtain its thermal behaviour in
   different operation conditions. Solutions were optimised for operating
   in a cooling regimen since it has been identified that the demands for
   comfort in open spaces in hot climates during the most severe summer
   months are more pronounced. Experimental results have allowed getting an
   inverse model to analyse the thermal behaviour of the solution. The
   inverse model achieved high precision in its estimations. Also, it
   facilitated knowing the radiant and convective effects. Only the radiant
   heat flux is relevant in open spaces with a low level of air
   confinement. Finally, the discussion describes the application of the
   proposed model. The model allows the replicability of the
   solution-creating new designs (integration) or evaluating into different
   operating conditions of the system. This discussion demonstrates the
   high level of knowledge acquired in the characterisation of the solution
   studied.},

Title = {CLIMATE CHANGE MEETS THE LAW OF THE HORSE},

Abstract = {The climate-policy debate has only recently turned its full attention to
   adaptation how to address the impacts of the climate change that we have
   already begun to experience and that will likely increase over time.
   Legal scholars have in turn begun to explore how the many different
   fields of law will and should respond. During this nascent period, one
   overarching question has gone unexamined: How will the legal system as a
   whole organize around climate change adaptation? Will a new, distinct
   field of climate adaptation law and policy emerge, or will legal
   institutions simply work away at the problem through unrelated,
   self-contained fields, as in the famous Law of the Horse? This Article
   is the first to examine that question comprehensively, to move beyond
   thinking about the law and climate change adaptation to consider the law
   of climate change adaptation.
   Part I of the Article lays out our methodological premises and approach.
   Using a model we call Stationarity Assessment, Part I explores how legal
   fields are structured and sustained based on assumptions about the
   variability of natural, social, and economic conditions, and how
   disruptions to that regime of variability can lead to the emergence of
   new fields of law and policy. Case studies of environmental law and
   environmental justice demonstrate the model's predictive power for the
   formation of new, distinct legal regimes.
   Part II applies the Stationarity Assessment model to the topic of
   climate change adaptation, using a case study of a hypothetical coastal
   region to demonstrate the potential for climate change impacts to
   disrupt relevant legal doctrines and institutions. We find that most
   fields of law appear to be capable of adapting effectively to climate
   change. In other words, without some active intervention, we expect the
   law and policy of climate change adaptation to follow the path of the
   Law of the Horse a collection of fields independently adapting to
   climate change rather than organically coalescing into a new and
   distinct field.
   Part III explores why, notwithstanding this conclusion, it may still be
   desirable to seek a different trajectory. Focusing on the likelihood of
   systemic adaptation decisions with perverse and harmful results, we
   identify the potential benefits offered by intervening to shape a new
   and distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy. Part IV then
   identifies the contours of such a field, exploring the distinct purposes
   of reducing vulnerability, ensuring resiliency, and safeguarding equity.
   These features provide the normative policy components for a law of
   climate change adaptation that would be more than just a Law of the
   Horse. This new field would not replace or supplant any existing field,
   however, as environmental law did with regard to nuisance law, and it
   would not be dominated by substantive doctrine. Rather, like the field
   of environmental justice, this new legal regime would serve as a
   holistic overlay across other fields to ensure more efficient,
   effective, and just climate adaptation solutions.},

Abstract = {Woody species' requirements and environmental sensitivity change from
   seedlings to adults, a process referred to as ontogenetic shift. Such
   shifts can be increased by climate change. To assess the changes in the
   difference of temperature experienced by seedlings and adults in the
   context of climate change, it is essential to have reliable climatic
   data over long periods that capture the thermal conditions experienced
   by the individuals throughout their life cycle. Here we used a unique
   cross-European database of 2,195 pairs of resurveyed forest plots with a
   mean intercensus time interval of 37 years. We inferred macroclimatic
   temperature (free-air conditions above tree canopies-representative of
   the conditions experienced by adult trees) and microclimatic temperature
   (representative of the juvenile stage at the forest floor, inferred from
   the relationship between canopy cover, distance to the coast and
   below-canopy temperature) at both surveys. We then address the
   long-term, large-scale and multitaxa dynamics of the difference between
   the temperatures experienced by adults and juveniles of 25 temperate
   tree species. We found significant, but species-specific, variations in
   the perceived temperature (calculated from presence/absence data)
   between life stages during both surveys. Additionally, the difference of
   the temperature experienced by the adult versus juveniles significantly
   increased between surveys for 8 of 25 species. We found evidence of a
   relationship between the difference of temperature experienced by
   juveniles and adults over time and one key functional trait (i.e. leaf
   area). Together, these results suggest that the temperatures experienced
   by adults versus juveniles became more decoupled over time for a subset
   of species, probably due to the combination of climate change and a
   recorded increase of canopy cover between the surveys resulting in
   higher rates of macroclimate than microclimate warming. Synthesis. We
   document warming and canopy-cover induced changes in the difference of
   the temperature experienced by juveniles and adults. These findings have
   implications for forest management adaptation to climate change such as
   the promotion of tree regeneration by creating suitable species-specific
   microclimatic conditions. Such adaptive management will help to mitigate
   the macroclimate change in the understorey layer.},

Abstract = {Tourism is a major industry that can lead to economic gains as well as
   to degraded environment and social infrastructure. Tourism has the
   potential to destroy the available common environmental resources
   through overuse and poor management practices, as limited information
   disclosure and poor monitoring of actions encourage the perpetuation and
   extension of environmental problems. Based on the adaptive resource
   management paradigm for addressing problems related to the use of the
   commons, this paper suggests a methodology for the development of a
   management tool that can provide island hotels with a continuous flow of
   timely, relevant, accurate and objective information on the
   environmental impact of critical corporate activities. The tool, named
   the destination environmental scorecard (DES), draws on activity-based
   management concepts and can help local hotel SMEs measure and compare
   their performance against certain standards and thus conduct operations
   in a responsible and measurable way to the benefit of both business
   financial performance and regional sustainability. The paper presents
   the DES operational characteristics and the potential benefits from its
   implementation. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP

Title = {A Generalized Spatial Measure for Resilience of Microbial Systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {The emergent property of resilience is the ability of a system to return
   to an original state after a disturbance. Resilience may be used as an
   early warning system for significant or irreversible community
   transition; that is, a community with diminishing or low resilience may
   be close to catastrophic shift in function or an irreversible collapse.
   Typically, resilience is quantified using recovery time, which may be
   difficult or impossible to directly measure in microbial systems. A
   recent study in the literature showed that under certain conditions, a
   set of spatial-based metrics termed recovery length, can be correlated
   to recovery time, and thus may be a reasonable alternative measure of
   resilience. However, this spatial metric of resilience is limited to use
   for step-change perturbations. Building upon the concept of recovery
   length, we propose a more general form of the spatial metric of
   resilience that can be applied to any shape of perturbation profiles
   (for example, either sharp or smooth gradients). We termed this new
   spatial measure ``perturbation-adjusted spatial metric of resilience{''}
   (PASMORE). We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed metric using
   a mathematical model of a microbial mat.},

Abstract = {Societies have adapted to climate and environmental variability
   throughout history. However, projected climate change poses multiple
   risks to mariculture because of the increased frequency of environmental
   threats that lie outside the realm of present day experience. Adaptive
   capacity evaluated in this study is a characteristic that would reflect
   mariculture industries ability to anticipate and respond to these
   changes, and to minimize, cope with, and recover from the consequences
   and take advantage of new opportunities arising from change. Drawing on
   a survey to 90 mussel mariculture companies in Chiloe-Chile, we have
   characterized the way the industry has adapted and recovered from
   specific stressors in productive capacity, namely; reduced mussel growth
   rates and reduced larval supply. We additionally assess determinants of
   the mussel industry's willingness to invest in building capacity to
   anticipate changes through analysing mussel aquaculture companies'
   assets to draw upon in times of need (capital; access to credit), the
   flexibility to change strategies, the companies' perception of the
   industry's social organization to act collectively (social capital), and
   their response to hypothetical scenarios regarding shocks in productive
   capacity. Results show heterogeneity in production decisions when facing
   environmental stressors. Results also show that the industry adapts in
   heterogeneous ways and that financial assets and social capital drive
   willingness to invest in adaptive capacity. Understanding past
   adaptation strategies and the willingness of the industry to invest in
   anticipating stressors allows us to begin exploring the consequences of
   new stressors. Importantly, as Chile and other countries are developing
   adaptation plans to face the multiple stressors of climate change,
   information about stakeholders' existing adaptation strategies and their
   determinants is becoming a critical bottleneck to inform these processes
   and assure they are in line with stakeholder needs and interest. While
   we use the Chilean mussel industry as a working example, the approach
   presented can inform other countries/regions wishing to explore the
   adaptive capacity of their aquaculture sectors.},

Title = {A new stochastic gain adaptive energy management system for smart
   microgrids considering frequency responsive loads},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Islanded microgrids as flexible, adaptive and sustainable smart cells of
   distribution power systems should be operated in accordance to both
   techno-economic purposes. Motivated by this need, the microgrid
   operators are in charge to elevate the active accommodation of both
   demand-side and supply-side distributed energy resources. To that end,
   in this paper, a new flexible frequency dependent energy management
   system is proposed through which distributed generators have time
   varying droop controllers with a gain-adaptive strategy. Besides to cope
   economically with uncertainty arise frequency excursions, a new,
   comfort-aware and versatile frequency dependent demand response program
   is mathematically formulated and conducted to the energy management
   system. It is aimed to co-optimize the microgrid energy resources such a
   way the day-ahead operational costs are managed subject to a secure
   frequency control portfolio. The presented model is solved using a
   two-stage stochastic programming and by a tractable efficient mixed
   integer linear programming approach. The simulation results are derived
   in 24-h scheduling time horizon and implemented on a typical test
   microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed hourly gain assignment and
   frequency responsive load management program has been verified
   thoroughly by analyzing the results. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Assessment of coastal vulnerability for extreme events},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The necessity to protect coastal regions from sea-level rise (SLR) and
   extreme events demands a rigorous assessment of coastal vulnerability.
   The intergovernmental panel for climate change (IPCC) predicts that
   climate change will severely impact the coastal region, river systems,
   and ur-ban infrastructures. The changing climate is observed to be
   increasing the frequency and magni-tude of extreme hydrometeorological
   conditions, such as storm surges that adversely affect coastal areas by
   flood inundation. This study emphasizes the need to use extreme events
   and so-cio-economic data to evaluate the Coastal Vulnerability Index
   (CVI) for planning and adaptation measures. Therefore, the present study
   utilizes spatially varying surge heights for improved esti-mation of the
   CVI, unlike the constant surge heights considered in the previous
   studies. For coastal adaptation measures, synthetic cyclones of
   different return periods, such as 20-, 50-and 100-year, are simulated
   using a hydrodynamic model to represent a range of risk and
   vulnerabil-ity in the estimated CVI. The proposed methodology for
   calculating the CVI is demonstrated by considering the Chennai coast in
   the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The use of spatial distribution of storm
   surges from hydrodynamic simulations makes the CVI more realistic. Such
   thorough assess-ments utilizing high-resolution CVI maps can help
   policymakers suggest appropriate measures for specific coastal zones,
   which are more devastatingly affected by shoreline erosion, SLR and
   storm surge. The vulnerability assessment indicates that great care is
   needed in the planning and adap-tation of the coastal ecosystem to
   extreme events for the safety and well-being of coastal popula-tions and
   infrastructures.},

Title = {Mathematical Modelling of Climate Change and Variability in the Context

Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The current climate change, unlike previous ones, is caused by human
   activity and is characterized by an unprecedented rate of increase in
   the near-surface temperature and an increase in the frequency and
   intensity of hazardous weather and climate events. To survive, society
   must be prepared to implement adaptation strategies and measures to
   mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This requires, first of
   all, knowledge of how the climate will change in the future. To date,
   mathematical modelling remains the only method and effective tool that
   is used to predict the climate system's evolution under the influence of
   natural and anthropogenic perturbations. It is important that
   mathematics and its methods and approaches have played a vital role in
   climate research for several decades. In this study, we examined some
   mathematical methods and approaches, primarily, mathematical modelling
   and sensitivity analysis, for studying the Earth's climate system,
   taking into account the dependence of human health on environmental
   conditions. The essential features of stochastic climate models and
   their application for the exploration of climate variability are
   examined in detail. As an illustrative example, we looked at the
   application of a low-order energy balance model to study climate
   variability. The effects of variations in feedbacks and the climate
   system's inertia on the power spectrum of global mean surface
   temperature fluctuations that characterized the distribution of
   temperature variance over frequencies were estimated using a sensitivity
   analysis approach. Our confidence in the obtained results was based on
   the satisfactory agreement between the theoretical power spectrum that
   was derived from the energy balance model and the power spectrum that
   was obtained from observations and coupled climate models, including
   historical runs of the CMIP5 models.},

Abstract = {The present study assessed climate change vulnerability in agricultural
   sector of low-lying Sagar Island of Bay of Bengal. Vulnerability indices
   were estimated using spatially aggregated biophysical and socio-economic
   parameters by applying principal component analysis and equal weight
   method. The similarities and differences of outputs of these two methods
   were analysed across the island. From the integration of outputs and
   based on the severity of vulnerability, explicit vulnerable zones were
   demarcated spatially. Results revealed that life subsistence agriculture
   in 11.8\% geographical area (2829 ha) of the island along the western
   coast falls under very high vulnerable zone (VHVZ VI of 84-99\%) to
   climate change. Comparatively higher values of exposure (0.53 +/- 0.26)
   and sensitivity (0.78 +/- 0.14) subindices affirmed that the VHV zone is
   highly exposed to climate stressor with very low adaptive capacity (ADI=
   0.24 +/- 0.16) to combat vulnerability to climate change. Hence, food
   security for a population of > 22 thousands comprising > 3.7 thousand
   agrarian households are highly exposed to climate change. Another 17\%
   area comprising 17.5\% population covering 20\% villages in
   north-western and eastern parts of the island also falls under high
   vulnerable (VI= 61\%-77\%) zone. Findings revealed large spatial
   heterogeneity in the degree of vulnerability across the island and thus,
   demands devising area specific planning (adaptation and mitigation
   strategies) to address the climate change impact implications both at
   macro and micro levels.},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation is one of the main strategies to address
   global climate change. The least developed countries and the small
   island states that lack financial resources to adapt to climate change
   are the most vulnerable nations to climate change. Although it would be
   more economical to adapt to climate change compared to the anticipated
   damage of not doing so, the demand for capital is estimated to range to
   hundreds of billions. The crucial question is how to manage investments
   to adapt to climate change globally. This study provides an overview of
   existing international provisions on climate finance for adaptation. It
   includes provisions through international financial institutions, United
   Nations agencies, bilateral and multilateral channels, and the private
   sector. It also explores how private sector finance can be further
   attracted to invest in climate change adaptation.},

Abstract = {Tourism is critical source of financing for conservation in Africa.
   South African National Parks (SANParks) raises in excess of 80\% of
   their own funds through tourism revenue. SANParks has a culture of
   co-learning between scientists and conservation managers through a
   process known as strategic adaptive management (SAM). Despite the
   critical role that tourism plays in SANParks, it has, until recently,
   not been formally incorporated in the SAM process. Moreover, SANParks
   recently adopted a new responsible tourism policy to guide the
   development and management of tourism across all national parks. The new
   policy calls for tourism that supports biodiversity conservation, is
   environmentally efficient and socially responsible. In 2011, SANParks
   initiated a tourism research programme to support the incorporation of
   tourism in SAM and to provide enabling information for the
   implementation of the responsible tourism policy. This article
   summarised the development of the tourism research programme in SANParks
   and its key research themes.},

Title = {Health impact of climate change in cities of middle-income countries:
   the case of China},
Journal = {BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-24},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: This review examines the human health impact of climate
   change in China. Through reviewing available research findings under
   four major climate change phenomena, namely extreme temperature, altered
   rainfall pattern, rise of sea level and extreme weather events, relevant
   implications for other middle-income population with similar contexts
   will be synthesized.
   Sources of data: Sources of data included bilingual peer-reviewed
   articles published between 2000 and 2018 in PubMed, Google Scholar and
   China Academic Journals Full-text Database.
   Areas of agreement: The impact of temperature on mortality outcomes was
   the most extensively studied, with the strongest cause-specific
   mortality risks between temperature and cardiovascular and respiratory
   mortality. The geographical focuses of the studies indicated variations
   in health risks and impacts of different climate change phenomena across
   the country.
   Areas of controversy: While rainfall-related studies predominantly focus
   on its impact on infectious and vector-borne diseases, consistent
   associations were not often found.
   Growing points: Mental health outcomes of climate change had been
   gaining increasing attention, particularly in the context of extreme
   weather events. The number of projection studies on the long-term impact
   had been growing.
   Areas timely for developing research: The lack of studies on the health
   implications of rising sea levels and on comorbidity and injury outcomes
   warrants immediate attention. Evidence is needed to understand health
   impacts on vulnerable populations living in growing urbanized cities and
   urban enclaves, in particular migrant workers. Location-specific
   climate-health outcome thresholds (such as temperature-mortality
   threshold) will be needed to support evidence-based clinical management
   plans and health impact mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable
   communities.},

Title = {Resilience and Adaptive Capacity of the Swan Coastal Plain Wetlands},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {An estimated 90\% of the Swan Coastal Plain (SCP) wetlands, located in
   southwestern Australia, have been lost because of infilling or drainage.
   This loss continues despite the well-known causes, which include
   nutrient enrichment; the invasion of exotic flora and fauna; loss of
   fringing vegetation; and altered hydrological regimes caused by
   groundwater abstraction; urbanization; and a drying climate. Further
   loss is expected with climate change exacerbating the undesirable
   ecosystem changes of remaining wetlands. In this study, we consider
   these wetlands as examples of social-ecological systems (SES) which are
   characterized by a close interaction of the ecosystem with the social
   system. We take the theory of resilient SES as a starting point to
   identify the adaptive capacity and resilience of the wetlands. We argue
   that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation
   processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We explore
   incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that
   policy responses arise across multiple scales and levels of jurisdiction
   and institution. By applying the theoretical framework of resilience to
   the SCP wetlands, we identified (un)desired ecosystem states of wetlands
   (hydrology and ecology) through different set of policy actions. Our
   results show that current wetland management is inadequate to maintain
   the ecosystem's functioning. We recommend cross-jurisdictional
   collaboration and the use of conceptual eco-hydrological models to
   depict gradual ecological change and types of regime shifts (thresholds,
   hysteresis, and irreversible changes). The different adaption options
   inform decision-makers to adequately adapt wetland management practices
   when uncertainty in ecosystem responses exist. Empirical data on how
   multiple jurisdictions operate and decide could help to further support
   decision-making. With this research we aim to narrow the science-policy
   interface which depends on corresponding cross-jurisdictional and
   institutional responses to coordinate wetland management policies and
   actions.},

Title = {A typology of natural resource use for livelihood impact assessments in
   Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {59-68},
Abstract = {The vulnerability of less developed regions is exacerbated by a lack of
   information to inform appropriate adaptation planning. We addressed this
   challenge in the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa (Nusa Tenggara Barat
   Province, Indonesia) by combining multiple sources of knowledge to
   develop a typology of natural resource use by communities of the
   province. This enabled an assessment of future impacts of drivers of
   change such as population growth and climate change. The typology was
   developed by cluster analysis of an inventory of the use of ecosystem
   goods and services (EGS) by the 105 rural subdistricts in the province.
   The data were largely elicited from expert knowledge, augmented by a
   rapid rural appraisal of communities' marine resource use in Sumbawa.
   Exploratory analysis of existing secondary data on livelihoods and land
   use provided context and skeleton data, which were developed further by
   experts. Overall, 82 EGS were identified from nine terrestrial, coastal,
   marine and freshwater habitats. EGS included livestock, cropping,
   forestry, wildlife hunting, fishing, aquaculture, mining, water (for
   drinking and agriculture) and tourism. The typology comprised seven
   types that captured 42\% of the variation in the data matrix. The types
   were moderately spatially aggregated and showed some congruence with
   administrative (district) boundaries. We discuss the implications of the
   results for planning livelihood adaptation strategies, and out-scaling
   these among subdistricts of matching types. (C) 2015 CSIRO. Published by

Pages = {132-140},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {P>Rising sea temperatures cause mass coral bleaching and threaten reefs
   worldwide. We show how maps of variations in thermal stress can be used
   to help manage reefs for climate change. We map proxies of chronic and
   acute thermal stress and develop evidence-based hypotheses for the
   future response of corals to each stress regime. We then incorporate
   spatially realistic predictions of larval connectivity among reefs of
   the Bahamas and apply novel reserve design algorithms to create reserve
   networks for a changing climate. We show that scales of larval dispersal
   are large enough to connect reefs from desirable thermal stress regimes
   into a reserve network. Critically, we find that reserve designs differ
   according to the anticipated scope for phenotypic and genetic adaptation
   in corals, which remains uncertain. Attempts to provide a complete
   reserve design that hedged against different evolutionary outcomes
   achieved limited success, which emphasises the importance of considering
   the scope for adaptation explicitly. Nonetheless, 15\% of reserve
   locations were selected under all evolutionary scenarios, making them a
   high priority for early designation. Our approach allows new insights
   into coral holobiont adaptation to be integrated directly into an
   adaptive approach to management.},

Abstract = {Balstrom, T. and Kirby, J., 0000. A GIS-based screening workflow for
   coastal storm surge impact assessments and mitigation action
   consideration. Journal of Coastal Research, 00(0), 000-000. Coconut
   Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. A GIS-based screening workflow is
   presented, providing first overviews of storm surge-induced inundation
   impacts along coastlines and where to consider mitigative action. The
   modeling is based on analysis of a hydro-conditioned digital terrain
   model (DTM) in Esri's ArcGIS Pro environment targeting undergraduate
   students, professional municipality planners, federal agencies, and
   more. Unlike existing commercial inundation modeling software, this
   application works in a simplified timeless setting on steady-state surge
   levels. This is accomplished only at the cost of not predicting when a
   specific targeted location is inundated. In return, fast computations
   are obtained. First, it is demonstrated how the DTM is turned into a
   hydro-conditioned terrain model, DHyMSea, protecting surges from
   entering land where sluices, highwater flaps, etc., are present. Second,
   the inundation screening is initiated for a user-defined number of sea
   levels. The outputs are individual raster layers for each level showing
   inundation extents and depths. Also, outputs are produced for each
   modeled level to back trace where the inundation came from. Third, a
   combined raster shows the minimum surge level to inundate any cell in
   the DHyMSea. Fourth, when considered where to raise protecting dikes,
   they can be digitized and have their elevation values stamped onto the
   DHyMSea. Finally, the inundation scenarios can be re executed to
   evaluate the mitigation impact; if necessary, the dikes' locations and
   elevation properties can be reconsidered, and the workflow re-executed
   once more. The workflow has proven successful in first assessments of
   inundation threats where sea levels are expected to rise significantly
   over the coming decades. Additionally, the workflow has proven
   successful in quality assessments of a DTM. To demonstrate the
   workflow's capabilities, storm surge consequences for the greater
   Copenhagen region's coastline in Denmark are discussed for inundation
   scenarios ranging from 1.0 m to 3.9 m above sea level in steps of 0.1 m.},

Abstract = {Infrastructure systems in coastal areas are exposed to episodic flooding
   exacerbated by sea-level rise stressors. To enable assessing the
   long-term resilience of infrastructure to such chronic impacts of
   sea-level rise, the present study created a novel complex system
   modeling framework that integrates: (i) stochastic simulation of
   sea-level rise stressors, based on the data obtained from downscaled
   climate studies pertaining to future projections of sea level and
   precipitation; (ii) dynamic modeling of infrastructure conditions by
   considering regular decay of infrastructure, as well as structural
   damages caused by flooding; and (iii) a decision-theoretic modeling of
   infrastructure management and adaptation processes based on bounded
   rationality and regret theories. Using the proposed framework and data
   collected from a road network in Miami, a multiagent computational
   simulation model was created to assess the long-term cost and
   performance of the road network under various sea-level rise scenarios,
   adaptation approaches, and network degradation effects. The results
   showed the capabilities of the proposed computational model for robust
   planning and scenario analysis to enhance the resilience of
   infrastructure systems to sea-level rise impacts.},

Abstract = {The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction emphasizes four
   principles: understanding risk; strengthening governance; investing in
   resilience; and building back better. Parametric insurance, offered to
   nations, provides a financial platform to pool and transfer risk from
   the regional to the global marketplace. The Caribbean Ocean Assets
   Sustainability faciliTy (COAST) expands upon the prior success of
   parametric insurance by providing a new platform to more fully link
   policy and technology with the aim of increasing disaster resilience.
   COAST focuses upon the nexus among food and nutrition security, the
   health of the ocean, and the occurrence of severe weather in the
   Caribbean Sea. The benefits of COAST - linking the technologies
   highlighted in the Climate-Smart Agriculture Sourcebook and the goals of
   the Caribbean Community Common Fisheries Policy - are examined using
   ghost fishing and spiny lobster as an example. This study points to the
   potential of using finance to provide a platform to empower technology
   to increase resilience in the face of a changing climate. (C) Published

Abstract = {Warming of the global climate is now unequivocal and its impact on
   Earth' functional units has become more apparent. Here, we show that
   marine ecosystems are not equally sensitive to climate change and reveal
   a critical thermal boundary where a small increase in temperature
   triggers abrupt ecosystem shifts seen across multiple trophic levels.
   This large-scale boundary is located in regions where abrupt ecosystem
   shifts have been reported in the North Atlantic sector and thereby
   allows us to link these shifts by a global common phenomenon. We show
   that these changes alter the biodiversity and carrying capacity of
   ecosystems and may, combined with fishing, precipitate the reduction of
   some stocks of Atlantic cod already severely impacted by exploitation.
   These findings offer a way to anticipate major ecosystem changes and to
   propose adaptive strategies for marine exploited resources such as cod
   in order to minimize social and economic consequences.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the resilience of social-ecological systems of small
   rural coastal communities in Atlantic Canada, we used different
   methodologies to not only increase awareness and understanding of what
   is climate change, but also to enhance public engagement and find
   solutions that are more appropriate to these communities. This entailed,
   for example, integrating scientific and existing knowledge. Communities
   need to be a part of planning and governance in order to identify the
   most important impacts and response measures. Local governance, from
   local service districts to municipal and support from the provincial
   government, are also considered essential in order to improve resilience
   in the study region. It is necessary to have both short-term (emergency)
   plans in effect as well as longer term planning for improved adaptation
   to increasing major storms. Adaptation measures have to consider any
   physicosocial aspects of hazards, with social responses integrated into
   physical and environmental hazard-proofing initiatives. Other
   suggestions are included here based on lessons learned from the
   research.},

Abstract = {This chapter analyzes the effects of wave energy converter farms on
   storm-induced coastal flooding under three sea-level rise scenarios:
   present situation, optimistic projection and pessimistic projection. For
   that, the Delft3D-Wave and XBeach-G models were jointly apply to a
   gravel-dominated coast in southern Spain. The results show that the wave
   farm induces redutions, for the three scenarios, in breaking wave
   heights (about 10\% and 25\% under westerly and easterly storms,
   respectively) and total run-up values (8\% and 10\%, respectively). This
   leads to reduction in flooded cross-shore distances and dry beach areas.
   The decreases in flooded dry beach areas for the three sea-level rise
   scenarios are between 1400 and 3900 m(2) under south-westerly storms,
   and between 2100 and 3400 m(2) under south-easterly storms. Therefore,
   wave farms are efficient management strategies to mitigate coastal
   flooding even under sea-level rise conditions.},

Abstract = {Increasing air temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels may affect the
   distribution of invasive species. Whereas there is wide knowledge on the
   effect of global change on temperate species, responses of tropical
   invasive species to these two global change drivers are largely unknown.
   We conducted a greenhouse experiment on Terminalia catappa L.
   (Combretaceae), an invasive tree species on Brazilian coastal areas, to
   evaluate the effects of increased air temperature and CO2 concentration
   on seed germination and seedling growth on the island of Santa Catarina
   (Florianopolis, Brazil). Seeds of the invasive tree were subjected to
   two temperature levels (ambient and +1.6 degrees C) and two CO2 levels
   (ambient and 650 ppmv) with a factorial design. Increased temperature
   enhanced germination rate and shortened germination time of T. catappa
   seeds. It also increased plant height, number of leaves and above-ground
   biomass. By contrast, increased atmospheric CO2 concentration had no
   significant effects, and the interaction between temperature and CO2
   concentration did not affect any of the measured traits. Terminalia
   catappa adapts to a relatively broad range of environmental conditions,
   being able to tolerate cooler temperatures in its invasive range. As T.
   catappa is native to tropical areas, global warming might favour its
   establishment along the coast of subtropical South America, while
   increased CO2 levels seem not to have significant effects on seed
   germination or seedling growth.},

Title = {The adaptive strategies of yaks to live in the Asian highlands},
Journal = {ANIMAL NUTRITION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {249-258},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The yak (Bos grunniens), an indigenous herbivore raised at altitudes
   between 3,000 and 5,000 m above sea level, is closely linked to more
   than 40 ethnic communities and plays a vital role in the ecological
   stability, livelihood security, socio-economic development, and ethnic
   cultural traditions in the Asian highlands. They provide the highlanders
   with meat, milk, fibres, leather and dung (fuel). They are also used as
   pack animals to transport goods, for travel and ploughing, and are
   important in many religious and traditional ceremonies. The Asian
   highlands are known for an extremely, harsh environment, namely low air
   temperature and oxygen content and high ultraviolet light and winds.
   Pasture availability fluc-tuates greatly, with sparse pasture of poor
   quality over the long seven-month cold winter. After longterm natural
   and artificial selections, yaks have adapted excellently to the harsh
   conditions: 1) by genomics, with positively selected genes involved in
   hypoxia response and energy metabolism; 2) anatomically, including a
   short tongue with a weak sense of taste, and large lung and heart; 3)
   physiologically, by insensitivity to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction,
   maintaining foetal haemoglobin throughout life, and low heart rate and
   heat production in the cold season; 4) behaviourlly, by efficient
   grazing and selecting forbs with high nutritional contents; 5) by low
   nitrogen and energy requirements for maintenance and low methane
   emission and nitrogen excretion, namely, `Low-Carbon' and `Nitrogen
   Saving' traits; 6) by harboring unique rumen microbiota with a distinct
   maturation pattern, that has co evolved with host metabolism. This
   review aims to provide an overview of the comprehensive adaptive
   strategies of the yak to the severe conditions of the highlands. A
   better understanding of these strategies that yaks employ to adapt to
   the harsh environment could be used in improving their production,
   breeding and management, and gaining benefits in ecosystem service and a
   more resilient livelihood to climate change in the Asian highlands. (c)

Abstract = {Due to extremely high rates of evaporation and low precipitation in the
   Persian Gulf, discharges from desalination plants (DPs) can lead to
   ecological stresses by increasing water temperatures, salinities, and
   heavy metal concentrations, as well as decreasing dissolved oxygen
   levels. We discuss the potential ecological impacts of DPs on marine
   organisms and propose mitigating measures to reduce the problems induced
   by DPs discharges. The daily capacity of DPs in the Persian Gulf exceeds
   11 million m(3) per day, which is approximately half of global daily
   freshwater production; multistage flash distillation (MSF) is the
   dominant desalination process. Results from field and laboratory studies
   indicate that there are potentially serious and chronic threats to
   marine communities following exposure to DP discharges, especially
   within the zoobenthos, echinodermata, seagrasses, and coral reefs. DP
   discharges can lead to decreases in sensitive species, plankton
   abundance, hard substrate epifauna, and growth rates of seagrasses.
   However, the broad applicability of any one of these impacts is
   currently hard to scale because of the limited number of studies that
   have been conducted to assess the ecological impacts of DP discharge on
   Persian Gulf organisms. Even so, available data suggest that
   appropriately sited, designed, and operated DPs combined with current
   developments in impingement and entrainment reduction technology can
   mitigate many of the negative environmental impacts of DPs.},

Title = {Differing marine animal biomass shifts under 21st century climate change

Abstract = {Under climate change, species composition and abundances in
   high-latitude waters are expected to substantially reconfigure with
   consequences for trophic relationships and ecosystem services. Outcomes
   are challenging to project at national scales, despite their importance
   for management decisions. Using an ensemble of six global marine
   ecosystem models we analyzed marine ecosystem responses to climate
   change from 1971 to 2099 in Canada's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under
   four standardized emissions scenarios. By 2099, under business-as-usual
   emissions (RCP8.5) projected marine animal biomass declined by an
   average of -7.7\% (+/- 29.5\%) within the Canadian EEZ, dominated by
   declines in the Pacific (-24\% +/- 24.5\%) and Atlantic (-25.5\% +/-
   9.5\%) areas; these were partially compensated by increases in the
   Canadian Arctic (+26.2\% +/- 38.4\%). Lower emissions scenarios
   projected successively smaller biomass changes, highlighting the
   benefits of stronger mitigation targets. Individual model projections
   were most consistent in the Atlantic and Pacific, but highly variable in
   the Arctic due to model uncertainties in polar regions. Different
   trajectories of future marine biomass changes will require
   regional-specific responses in conservation and management strategies,
   such as adaptive planning of marine protected areas and species-specific
   management plans, to enhance resilience and rebuilding of Canada's
   marine ecosystems and commercial fish stocks.},

Title = {Assessment of temperature optimum signatures of corals at both
   latitudinal extremes of the Red Sea},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Rising ocean temperatures are pushing reef-building corals beyond their
   temperature optima (T-opt), resulting in reduced physiological
   performances and increased risk of bleaching. Identifying refugia with
   thermally resistant corals and understanding their thermal adaptation
   strategy is therefore urgent to guide conservation actions. The Gulf of
   Aqaba (GoA, northern Red Sea) is considered a climate refuge, hosting
   corals that may originate from populations selected for thermal
   resistance in the warmer waters of the Gulf of Tadjoura (GoT, entrance
   to the Red Sea and 2000 km south of the GoA). To better understand the
   thermal adaptation strategy of GoA corals, we compared the temperature
   optima (T-opt) of six common reef-building coral species from the GoA
   and the GoT by measuring oxygen production and consumption rates as well
   as photophysiological performance (i.e. chlorophyll fluorescence) in
   response to a short heat stress. Most species displayed similar T-opt
   between the two locations, highlighting an exceptional continuity in
   their respective physiological performances across such a large
   latitudinal range, supporting the GoA refuge theory. Stylophora
   pistillata showed a significantly lower T-opt in the GoA, which may
   suggest an ongoing population-level selection (i.e. adaptation) to the
   cooler waters of the GoA and subsequent loss of thermal resistance.
   Interestingly, all T-opt were significantly above the local maximum
   monthly mean seawater temperatures in the GoA (27.1 degrees C) and close
   or below in the GoT (30.9 degrees C), indicating that GoA corals, unlike
   those in the GoT, may survive ocean warming in the next few decades.
   Finally, Acropora muricata and Porites lobata displayed higher
   photophysiological performance than most species, which may translate to
   dominance in local reef communities under future thermal scenarios.
   Overall, this study is the first to compare the T-opt of common
   reef-building coral species over such a latitudinal range and provides
   insights into their thermal adaptation in the Red Sea.},

Title = {Adaptive strategy biases in engineered ecosystems: Implications for
   plant community dynamics and the provisioning of ecosystem services to
   people},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Plant communities in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) such as
   biofilters play an integral role in ecosystem services provisioning,
   such that many design manuals now feature plant lists that guide
   vegetation selection. 2. This study looks at the implications of those
   lists for biofilter plant communities and their services, focusing on
   (1) how plants are selected across US climate zones, (2) whether
   selected plants exhibit adaptive strategy biases (i.e. towards
   competitive, stress tolerant or ruderal strategies that might impact
   ecosystem services provisioning) and (3) whether human-induced selection
   or natural climatic processes underly any biases revealed. 3. Our
   results suggest that biofilter plant strategies are significantly biased
   towards stress tolerance or competitiveness (depending on the climate
   zone) and away from ruderalness relative to the broader pool of native
   and wetland-adapted native species. 4. Competitive bias was evident in
   humid-continental climates and stress-tolerant bias in hot coastal/arid
   climates, with some degree of anti-ruderal bias present across all
   zones. 5. These biases are correlated with human concerns related to
   water availability and climate (water conservation; p < 0.05,
   irrigation; p < 0.1, climate extremes; p < 0.1). They do not appear to
   reflect strict climatological limits (i.e. limits that are independent
   of preferences or design constraints imposed by people) because they are
   not also evident for native plants. 6. The benefits and costs of
   relaxing these biases are discussed, focusing on the implications for
   water quality, hydrologic, and cultural services provisioning and the
   dynamicity of GSI ecosystems, particularly their capacity to
   self-repair, a prerequisite for the development of self-sustaining GSI.},

Title = {A 25-Year Study of the Population Dynamics of a Harvested Population of
   Sika Deer on Kyushu Island, Japan},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations have damaged habitats,
   agricultural crops, and commercial forests in many parts of the world,
   including Asia, Europe, northern America, and New Zealand. Population
   management of sika deer is an important task in those areas. To better
   understand large-scale management and improve management efficiency, the
   authors estimated spatio-temporal changes of density distribution and
   population dynamics of a managed population of sika deer on Kyushu
   Island (approximately 36,750 km(2)), Japan. The authors estimated these
   changes by using fecal pellet count surveys conducted from 1995 to 2019
   and results from a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model. No
   decreasing trend of populations were observed at the island and
   prefectural scales, even though the management goal has been to reduce
   the population by half, and harvesting on the island increased annually
   until it reached about 110,000 sika deer in 2014. A possible explanation
   for the stable population dynamics is that the population used to
   determine the harvest number under the prefectural management plan was
   originally underestimated. This study highlights not only the
   difficulties of wide-area management of sika deer but also three
   important factors for successful management: reducing the risk of
   management failure, using an adaptive management approach, and
   appropriate management scale.},

Abstract = {This article presents governance and institutional strategies for
   climate-induced community relocations. In Alaska, repeated extreme
   weather events coupled with climate change-induced coastal erosion
   impact the habitability of entire communities. Community residents and
   government agencies concur that relocation is the only adaptation
   strategy that can protect lives and infrastructure. Community relocation
   stretches the financial and institutional capacity of existing
   governance institutions. Based on a comparative analysis of three
   Alaskan communities, Kivalina, Newtok, and Shishmaref, which have chosen
   to relocate, we examine the institutional constraints to relocation in
   the United States. We identify policy changes and components of a
   toolkit that can facilitate community-based adaptation when
   environmental events threaten people's lives and protection in place is
   not possible. Policy changes include amendment of the Stafford Act to
   include gradual geophysical processes, such as erosion, in the statutory
   definition of disaster and the creation of an adaptive governance
   framework to allow communities a continuum of responses from protection
   in place to community relocation. Key components of the toolkit are
   local leadership and integration of social and ecological well-being
   into adaptation planning.},

Abstract = {Tribal communities in the United States, particularly in coastal areas,
   are being forced to relocate due to accelerated rates of sea level rise,
   land erosion, and/or permafrost thaw brought on by climate change.
   Forced relocation and inadequate governance mechanisms and budgets to
   address climate change and support adaptation strategies may cause loss
   of community and culture, health impacts, and economic decline, further
   exacerbating tribal impoverishment and injustice. Sovereign tribal
   communities around the US, however, are using creative strategies to
   counter these losses. Taking a human rights approach, this article looks
   at communities' advocacy efforts and strategies in dealing with climate
   change, displacement, and relocation. Case studies of Coastal Alaska and
   Louisiana are included to consider how communities are shaping their own
   relocation efforts in line with their cultural practices and values. The
   article concludes with recommendations on steps for moving forward
   toward community-led and government-supported resettlement programs.},

Title = {Adapted hydropower-driven water supply system: assessment of an
   underground application in an Indonesian karst area},
Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {259-278},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Populated karst landscapes can be found all over the world, although
   their natural boundary conditions mostly lead to distinct challenges
   regarding a sustainable water supply. Especially in developing and
   emerging countries, this situation aggravates since appropriate
   technologies and water management concepts are rarely available. Against
   this background, the interdisciplinary, German-Indonesian joint project
   ``Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Indonesia'', funded by
   the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), focused on
   the development and exemplary implementation of adapted techniques to
   remedy the partly severe water scarcity in the region Gunung Sewu. This
   karst area, widely known as ``Java's poorhouse'', is located on the
   southern coast of Java Island and distinctly suffers from the mentioned
   constraints. Under the aegis of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
   (KIT), the conceptual and technical achievements of the ``IWRM
   Indonesia'' joint research project are characterized by a high potential
   for multiplication not only for karst areas but also for non-karst
   regions. One of the project's major accomplishments is the erection of
   an innovative hydropower-driven water supply facility located in a karst
   cave 100 m below ground and continuously supplying tens of thousands of
   people with fresh water. Referring to the plant's innovative character
   and the demanding conditions on-site, the implementation was a highly
   iterative process leading to today's autonomous operation by an
   Indonesian public authority. Based on the experiences gained during
   design, construction, operation and monitoring phase, this paper
   introduces an implementation approach for adapted technologies as well
   as a comprising technical and economical assessment of the plant's
   operation.},

   Broads Wetland Case Study},
Journal = {INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {719-725},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The dynamic nature of environmental change in coastal areas means that a
   flexible ``learning by doing{''} management strategy has a number of
   advantages. This article lays out the principles of such a strategy and
   then assesses an actual planning and management process focused on
   climate change consequences for the Broads wetland on the East coast of
   England. The management strategy focused on the concept of ecosystem
   services (stocks and flows) provided by the coastal wetland and the
   threats and opportunities posed to the area by sea level rise and other
   climate change impacts. The analysis explores the process by which an
   adaptive management plan has been formulated and coproduced by a
   combination of centralized (vertical) and stakeholder social network
   (horizontal) arrangements. The process values where feasible the
   ecosystem services under threat and prioritizes response actions.
   Coastal management needs a careful balance between strategic
   requirements imposed at a national scale and local schemes that affect
   regional and/or local communities and social networks. These networks
   aided by electronic media have allowed groups to engage more rapidly and
   effectively with policy proposals. However, successful deliberation is
   conditioned by a range of context specific factors, including the type
   of social networks present and their relative competitive and/or
   complementary characteristics. The history of consultation and dialogue
   between official agencies and stakeholders also plays a part in
   contemporary deliberation processes and the success of their outcomes.
   Among the issues highlighted are the multiple dimensions of nature's
   value; the difficulty of quantifying some ecosystem service changes,
   especially for cultural services; and the problem of ``stakeholder
   fatigue{''} complicating engagement arrangements. (C) 2016 SETAC},

Title = {Social media within digitalisation for coastal resilience: The case of
   coastal fisheries in Minamisoma, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Attention to digitalisation as a resilience strategy for coastal
   communities is growing. However, it is critical that digital
   technologies and approaches are not forced on localities to enable
   national or regional sustainability goals, and that communities are
   engaged and empowered in digital approaches to support resilience on
   their own terms. This is especially so in a coastal context, where
   marginality may be greater and where communities may already face
   multiple pressures. In response, we look at how one particular form of
   digital technology - social media - may support resilience-building for
   Minamisoma, a fishing community facing complex and ongoing environmental
   and socio-economic challenges following the 2011 nuclear disaster. We
   find that social media offers a channel for some community members in
   Minamisoma to (re)construct a sense of pride and identity through
   engagement with fisheries, seafood and the coastal landscape, and to
   challenge negative external per-ceptions of their locality. Yet we
   caution that whilst social media as one digital approach is a valuable
   repository for pride and identity, it may not be so useful for assessing
   broader consumer or societal trends upon which the economic
   revitalisation of a coastal community trading on fisheries and tourism
   may depend. Nonetheless, we conclude that within a wider suite of
   digitalisation measures, social media can support coastal actors to
   sustain a narrative of resilience locally, and continually engage with
   those in other locations. This may be especially important in the face
   of ongoing environmental challenges, where communities face multiple
   setbacks over time.},

Abstract = {China is amongst the countries most severely affected by coastal and
   marine disasters. In this study, the annual variation and geographic
   distribution of the direct economic losses and fatalities caused by
   rapid onset coastal and marine disasters in China have been analysed.
   This Was based on a collection of historical documents and official
   records. The five main hazards include Storm surges, rough seas, sea
   ice, red tides and green tides. The results show that: (1) Storm surges
   caused the most economic losses (92\% of the total); (2) At national
   scale, direct economic losses induced by coastal and marine disasters
   fluctuated with no clear trend; the number of fatalities per year
   declined, and in relative terms both economic losses and fatalities
   decreased dramatically throughout time; (3) Substantial heterogeneity
   exists across the 11 provincial-level administrative regions in terms of
   the spatial pattern and temporal trends of coastal and marine hazards,
   exposure, vulnerability and observed impacts. Guangthou, Fujian,
   Zhejiang and Hainan provinces experienced the highest direct economic
   losses and fatalities due to repeated typhoon-induced storm surges. The
   decline in adverse impacts caused by hazards is due to substantial
   progress in coastal and marine disaster prevention and migration in
   China, largely thanks to institutional measures, plus adaptation and
   mitigation actions at both national and regional levels. Coastal China
   still faces growing risks due to socio-economic development, climate
   change, as well as subsidence and new emerging marine disasters (e.g,
   green tides). Further management needs to promote integrated solutions
   across socio-economic development, disaster risk reduction and
   environmental conservation in coastal regions. This should happen at
   national and international levels as `disasters can affect neighboring
   countries, and their marine environments and socid-ecological systems.
   Lessons may be learnt from countries experiencing similar problems over
   the long-term. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A number of sea water desalination technologies have been developed
   during the last several decades. Although these techniques are promising
   options for freshwater augmentation in coastal establishments and
   islands, they may have certain impacts to the environment. To safeguard
   a sustainable use of desalination technology, the impacts of the
   desalination facility should be identified and mitigated by means of an
   environmental impact assessment study as well as by environmental
   management plans (EMPs). The EMP should include tables answering
   questions like who is responsible from what and when and, which
   precautions will be taken and where these precautions should be
   implemented. This study aims to analyze the potential environmental
   impacts of desalination plants and propose measures mitigating their
   negative impacts. In the article, components of a desalination system,
   i.e. open intake, pretreatment, membrane desalination system, outfall
   with diffuser, and transfer pipeline, are identified as first. Waste
   disposal, air quality, noise, traffic, flora and fauna, water quality,
   and visual amenity are listed as principal issues affected from both
   construction works and operation. Finally, measures in order to prevent
   or minimize those adverse effects to acceptable levels are assessed.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the response by the United States
   political-military sector to climate change through the lens of
   securitisation theory. Research undertaken used mixed content analysis
   techniques to systematically examine more than 2,000 speech-acts,
   policies, doctrinal articles and other publications between 2003 and
   2013. Particular attention was paid to the speech-acts of prominent
   persons in command and leadership appointments as well as major climate
   programme and initiatives of the United States Navy (USN). The case
   study reveals that climate security first appeared as a concern during
   the George W. Bush Administration, though it was not a major factor. In
   early 2008 the Bush Administration released the National Defense
   Authorisation Act (NDAA) that directed the US military to undertake a
   sweeping examination of climate impacts on its operations. A key
   component of this was the inclusion of climate change in the 2010
   National Security Strategy and Quadrennial Defense Review. It also laid
   wider foundations, bringing climate security to greater prominence in
   the US military at a time that segued with the ascension of the Obama
   Administration and its more activist climate agenda. The US Navy-the
   service most at risk from sea-level rise, natural disasters and with
   increased operational opportunities in the Arctic-adopted a proactive
   approach to climate change that included prominence in the speech-acts
   of USN leaders and via publication of several adaptation and mitigation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Monitoring by local community managers tightens the adaptive management
   cycle by linking management more closely with its evaluation, so
   management actions become more responsive to the field situation. Local
   community volunteers, usually fishers, managing coral reef protected
   areas in the Philippines used simple methods (e.g. snorkeling fish
   visual census) to periodically monitor and evaluate reef protection
   together with professional marine biologists. Except for estimates of
   hard coral, data collected by local volunteers were not significantly
   correlated with data collected by biologists (specifically abundance
   estimates of sand, major reef fish carnivores, and fish herbivores).
   Community-collected fish data generally have higher variance and show
   higher abundances than biologist-collected data. Nonetheless, though the
   data was less precise, the locally based monitoring identified or
   confirmed the need for management actions that were generic in nature
   (e.g. stronger enforcement, organizational strengthening, etc.). The
   locally based monitoring also encouraged cooperation among stakeholders
   and prompted a management response. Little time and financing is
   required after initial establishment and replication has been
   increasing. However, sustainability depends upon the communities'
   perceived added-value of undertaking the monitoring and input from a
   paid and/or more committed local person (e.g. government) who
   occasionally conducts monitoring himself/herself and supervises the
   community monitoring. Management impact depends heavily upon good
   integration with active management interventions outside the monitoring
   effort per se.},

Abstract = {Climate change is affecting fishing communities across Bangladesh. While
   work has been undertaken to investigate the nature of these impacts,
   understanding how fishers perceive climate change at a local level,
   especially within developing countries, is crucial. This paper presents
   the results of a three-year study of the contextual determinants and
   dimensions of artisanal fishing community perceptions about climate
   change in coastal Bangladesh. Results of this study indicate that
   geographic characteristics, socio-economic status, worldviews,
   tradition, observations and disaster experiences are important
   determinants for shaping fishers' perceptions about climate change.
   Fishers also demonstrate a long-standing tradition of risk adaptation
   strategies, but do not link them to climate change. We argue that these
   perceptions provide ideas for how to form appropriate climate responses
   at local levels not only in Bangladesh but other developing countries.},

Abstract = {The Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL) is part of Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon in
   Portugal, which is classified as a Special Protection Area under the
   European Habitats and Birds Directives. This part of the system,
   corresponding to the confluence of the Vouga River with the lagoon, is
   very important culturally and socioeconomically for the local
   communities, taking place several human activities, especially
   agriculture. To prevent salt water intrusion from the Ria de Aveiro into
   agriculture fields, a floodbank was initiated in the 90's. In frame of
   ongoing changes in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics, the existing floodbank
   will be now extended, introducing further changes in the ecological
   dynamics of the BVL and its adjacent area. As a consequence, the water
   level in the floodbank down-stream side is expected to rise, increasing
   the submersion period in tidal wetlands, and leading to coastal squeeze.
   The aim of this study is to apply an ecosystem based-management approach
   to mitigate the impacts on biodiversity resulting from the management
   plan. To do so, we have modelled the implications of the changes in
   several hydrological and environmental variables on four saltmarsh
   species and habitats distribution, as well as on their associated
   ecosystem services, both upstream and downstream of the floodbank. The
   ecosystem services of interest were prioritized by stakeholders'
   elicitation, which were then used as an input to a spatial
   multi-criteria analysis aimed to find the best management actions to
   compensate for the unintended loss of biodiversity and ecosystem
   services in the BVL. According to our results, the main areas to be
   preserved in the BVL were the traditional agricultural mosaic fields;
   the freshwater courses and the subtidal estuarine channels. By combining
   ecology with the analysis of social preferences, this study shows how
   co-developed solutions can support adaptive management and the
   conservation of coastal ecosystems. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Osmoregulatory mechanisms have been investigated in different groups of
   bacteria. Nevertheless, the molecular processes of deep-sea
   microorganism in response to salt stress have not been investigated. In
   this study, the temporal gene expression patterns of the deep-sea
   bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 in response to high salinity
   stress were evaluated through whole-genome microarray analysis. A total
   of 35, 13, and 19 genes were differentially expressed after WP3 was
   exposed to high salinity stress for 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively.
   Only five genes were identified as commonly differentially expressed.
   The hierarchical clustering analysis of the gene expression patterns
   revealed that WP3 uses common adaptive strategies to cope with the
   multiple environmental stresses. The results of this study provide the
   first glimpse into the changes in global gene expression in benthic
   bacterium under high salt stress. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All sights

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts on marine environments have been somewhat
   neglected in climate change research, particularly with regard to their
   social dimensions and implications. This paper contributes to addressing
   this gap through presenting a UK focused mixed-method study of how
   publics frame, understand and respond to marine climate change-related
   issues. It draws on data from a large national survey of UK publics (N =
   1,001), undertaken in January 2011 as part of a wider European survey,
   in conjunction with in-depth qualitative insights from a citizens' panel
   with participants from the East Anglia region, UK. This reveals that
   discrete marine climate change impacts, as often framed in technical or
   institutional terms, were not the most immediate or significant issues
   for most respondents. Study participants tended to view these climate
   impacts `in context', in situated ways, and as entangled with other
   issues relating to marine environments and their everyday lives. Whilst
   making connections with scientific knowledge on the subject, public
   understandings of marine climate impacts were mainly shaped by personal
   experience, the visibility and proximity of impacts, sense of personal
   risk and moral or equity-based arguments. In terms of responses, study
   participants prioritised climate change mitigation measures over
   adaptation, even in high-risk areas. We consider the implications of
   these insights for research and practices of public engagement on marine
   climate impacts specifically, and climate change more generally. (C)

Journal = {FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Climate change is impacting natural ecosystems and the services they
   provide at an unprecedented rate, yet management is not keeping pace
   with radical ecosystem transformations. Management in marine systems is
   primarily designed to regulate fishing pressures, which may be of
   limited use in addressing large-scale climate impacts. The
   Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) is a flexible, novel framework that gives
   managers a way to structure and plan how to respond to radical
   shifts/transformations in ecosystems. We present marine case studies of
   broad scale impacts and outline how the responses may fit into the RAD
   concept. We use the RAD framework to address the collapse of the kelp
   forest in northern California and examine how potential policy guiding
   restoration strategies can be organised. We conclude that the response
   to most marine ecosystem transformations has been to use the resist
   strategy that includes adaptive management, and we suggest that for the
   kelp forests in California the resist strategy provides the best option
   for moving forward. The RAD framework will be useful for marine
   ecosystem transformations in which systems have reached their tipping
   points and now require novel restoration tools and thinking as we face
   climate change stressors and an unpredictable future.},

Abstract = {This review study examines the state of meteorological drought over
   Africa, focusing on historical trends, impacts, mitigation strategies,
   and future prospects. Relevant meteorological drought-related articles
   were systematically sourced from credible bibliographic databases
   covering African subregions in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries
   (i.e. from 1950 to 2021), using suitable keywords. Past studies show
   evidence of the occurrence of extreme drought events across the
   continent. The underlying mechanisms are mostly attributed to complex
   interactions of dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms. The resultant
   impact is evidenced in the decline of agricultural activities and water
   resources and the environmental degradation across all subregions.
   Projected changes show recovery from drought events in the west/east
   African domain, while the south and north regions indicate a tendency
   for increasing drought characteristics. The apparent intricate link
   between the continent's development and climate variability, including
   the reoccurrence of drought events, calls for paradigm shifts in policy
   direction. Key resources meant for the infrastructural and technological
   growth of the economy are being diverted to develop coping mechanisms to
   adapt to climate change effects, which are changing. Efficient service
   delivery to drought-prone hotspots, strengthening of drought monitoring,
   forecasting, early warning, and response systems, and improved research
   on the combined effects of anthropogenic activities and changes in
   climate systems are valuable to practitioners, researchers, and
   policymakers regarding drought management in Africa today and in the
   future.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament is concerned about the lack of information on
   the relevance of nine million Europeans engaged in marine recreational
   fishing (MRF), committing Member States to encourage environmental and
   socioeconomic sustainability of the sector. The objective of this paper
   is to provide recommendations to guide research actions and management
   policies, based on the case of Spain, a key country because its complex
   administrative regimen and the intensive use of its coasts, including
   900,000 recreational fishers. A review of the state of the knowledge was
   performed to identify research gaps, while governance challenges were
   identified in an International Symposium on MRF. In the last two decades
   research on MRF was remarkable (139 publications). However, public
   investment in research ((sic)2.44 million in the same period) should be
   improved to cover knowledge gaps on socioeconomic relevance, on impacts
   on vulnerable species and on implications of global warming. The license

Abstract = {Information on future climate change considering regional
   characteristics is necessary to establish adaptation strategies for
   global warming. We investigated the seasonal characteristics of future
   climate projections over Japan and surroundings (JPN) in the late 21st
   century, focusing especially on the source of uncertainty, based on two
   ensembles of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
   and the Meteorological Research Institute atmospheric general
   circulation model (MRI-AGCM) global warming simulations. The ensemble
   mean surface air temperature increase over JPN is lower than that over
   the East Asian land region (EAS), reflecting the continent-ocean
   contrast, whereas quantitative changes in future precipitation depend on
   the ensembles. The CMIP5 mean atmospheric circulation around JPN weakens
   in winter and summer, while the future seasonal march tends to be
   delayed in the northern part of JPN during spring and autumn.
   Significant CMIP5 inter-model correlations are detected between the JPN
   climate projections and future circulation anomalies - e.g. the ensemble
   members simulating the westerly/southeasterly wind anomaly tend to
   project hotter/wetter future summers. The high-resolution MRI-AGCM
   projection is consistent with the CMIP5 inter-model correlations when
   the future change in typhoon-associated precipitation is removed,
   indicating typhoon simulations can substantially influence future
   projections.},

   intensification of coastal flood hazard},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Global warming is expected to drive increasing extreme sea levels (ESLs)
   and flood risk along the world's coastlines. In this work we present
   probabilistic projections of ESLs for the present century taking into
   consideration changes in mean sea level, tides, wind-waves, and storm
   surges. Between the year 2000 and 2100 we project a very likely increase
   of the global average 100-year ESL of 34-76 cm under a
   moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario and of 58-172 cm under a
   business as usual scenario. Rising ESLs are mostly driven by thermal
   expansion, followed by contributions from ice mass-loss from glaciers,
   and ice-sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Under these scenarios ESL
   rise would render a large part of the tropics exposed annually to the
   present-day 100-year event from 2050. By the end of this century this
   applies to most coastlines around the world, implying unprecedented
   flood risk levels unless timely adaptation measures are taken.},

Abstract = {Brazil hosts the largest expanse of tropical ecosystems within protected
   areas (PAs), which shelter biodiversity and support traditional human
   populations. We assessed the vulnerability to climate change of 993
   terrestrial and coastal-marine Brazilian PAs by combining indicators of
   climatic-change hazard with indicators of PA resilience (size, native
   vegetation cover, and probability of climate-driven vegetation
   transition). This combination of indicators allows the identification of
   broad climate-change adaptation pathways. Seventeen PAs (20,611 km(2))
   were highly vulnerable and located mainly in the Atlantic Forest (7
   PAs), Cerrado (6), and the Amazon (4). Two hundred fifty-eight PAs
   (756,569 km(2)), located primarily in Amazonia, had a medium
   vulnerability. In the Amazon and western Cerrado, the projected severe
   climatic change and probability of climate-driven vegetation transition
   drove vulnerability up, despite the generally good conservation status
   of PAs. Over 80\% of PAs of high or moderate vulnerability are managed
   by indigenous populations. Hence, besides the potential risks to
   biodiversity, the traditional knowledge and livelihoods of the people
   inhabiting these PAs may be threatened. In at least 870 PAs, primarily
   in the Atlantic Forest and Amazon, adaptation could happen with little
   or no intervention due to low climate-change hazard, high resilience
   status, or both. At least 20 PAs in the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and
   Amazonia should be targeted for stronger interventions (e.g.,
   improvement of ecological connectivity), given their low resilience
   status. Despite being a first attempt to link vulnerability and
   adaptation in Brazilian PAs, we suggest that some of the PAs identified
   as highly or moderately vulnerable should be prioritized for testing
   potential adaptation strategies in the near future.},

Title = {NEGOTIATING RACISM: THE VOICES OF ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIAN POST-GRADUATE

Abstract = {Purpose - Recent research into the nature and impact of racial
   discrimination directed at Aboriginal Australian children and youth has
   revealed how such a stressor can negatively impact upon varying physical
   health, emotional well-being and education outcomes. Despite the
   strength of these findings for identifying need for action, such
   research has been largely limited by either a lack of consideration as
   to the potentially complex nature of racism targeting Aboriginal
   Australians or alternatively offering little in identifying sources of
   resiliency for Aboriginal Australian students. It is the purpose of this
   investigation to identify the voices of high-achieving Aboriginal
   Australian post-graduate students with regard to their experiences of
   racism, how they may have coped with racism and their advice to future
   generations of Aboriginal youth.
   Methodology - A series of in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted
   with seven Aboriginal Australian PhD students within an Australian
   University. The interviews were designed to capture the perceptions,
   experiences and coping strategies used when faced with racism. The data
   was carefully and repeatedly scrutinized for emerging themes that were
   shared by the majority of participants.
   Findings - Numerous themes emerged with issues pertaining to the
   veracity of racism and conceptualizations of racism across
   historical/cross-generational, contemporary, verbal, physical,
   institutional, cultural, political, electronic, personal,
   reverse/internalized and collective/group dimensions. In addition, the
   negative impact of racism was identified, but more importantly, a series
   of interrelated positive coping responses (e.g. externalization of
   racism, social support) were voiced.
   Implications - The implications of these results attest to the need to
   understand the many faces of racism that may still be experienced by
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders today. In addition, the coping
   strategies identified may be seen as valuable agents of resiliency for
   future generations of Aboriginal youth.},

Abstract = {Policy measures regarding adaptation to climate change include efforts
   to adjust socio-economic and ecologic systems. Colombia has undertaken
   various measures in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation
   since becoming a party of the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and a party of the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995.
   The first national communication to the UNFCCC stated how Colombian
   agriculture will be severely impacted under different emission scenarios
   and time frames. The analyses in this document further support that
   climate change will severely threaten the socioeconomics of Colombian
   agriculture. We first query national data sources to characterize the
   agricultural sector. We then use 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM)
   outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural production may be
   affected by climate change, and show the expected changes to years
   2040-2069 ({''}2050{''}) under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2)
   and the overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100. We
   then evaluate expected changes within different regions and measure the
   proportion of area affected within each crop's distributional range. By
   2050, climatic change in Colombia will likely impact 3.5 million people,
   14 \% of national GDP corresponding to agriculture, employment of 21 \%
   of the population, agro-industries, supply chains, and food and
   nutritional security. If no adaptation measures are taken, 80 \% of
   crops would be impacted in more than 60 \% of their current areas of
   cultivation, with particularly severe impacts in high value perennial
   and exportable crops. Impacts also include soil degradation and organic
   matter losses in the Andes hillsides; likely flooding in the Caribbean
   and Pacific coasts; niche losses for coffee, fruit, cocoa, and bananas;
   changes in prevalence of pests and diseases; and increases in the
   vulnerabilities of non-technically developed smallholders. There is,
   however, still time to change the current levels of vulnerability if a
   multidisciplinary focus (i.e., agronomic, economic, and social) in
   vulnerable sectors is undertaken. Each sub-sector and the Government
   need to invest in: (1) data collection, (2) detailed, regionally-based
   impact assessments, (3) research and development, and (4) extension and
   technology transfer. Support to vulnerable smallholders should be given
   by the state in the form of agricultural insurance systems
   contextualized under the phenomenon of climate change. A national
   coordination scheme led by (but not restricted to) the Ministry of
   Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) with the contributions of
   national and international institutions is needed to address
   agricultural adaptation.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The resilience of coastal social- ecological systems may depend on
   adaptive responses to aquaculture disease outbreaks that can threaten
   wild and farm fish. A nine- year study of parasitic sea lice
   (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from
   Pacific Canada indicates that adaptive changes in parasite management on
   salmon farms have yielded positive conservation outcomes. After four
   years of sea lice epizootics and wild salmon population decline,
   parasiticide application on salmon farms was adapted to the timing of
   wild salmon migrations. Winter treatment of farm fish with
   parasiticides, prior to the out- migration of wild juvenile salmon, has
   reduced epizootics of wild salmon without significantly increasing the
   annual number of treatments. Levels of parasites on wild juvenile salmon
   significantly influence the growth rate of affected salmon populations,
   suggesting that these changes in management have had positive outcomes
   for wild salmon populations. These adaptive changes have not occurred
   through formal adaptive management, but rather, through multi-
   stakeholder processes arising from a contentious scientific and public
   debate. Despite the apparent success of parasite control on salmon farms
   in the study region, there remain concerns about the long- term
   sustainability of this approach because of the unknown ecological
   effects of parasticides and the potential for parasite resistance to
   chemical treatments.},

Title = {Understanding policy and technology responses in mitigating urban heat
   islands: A literature review and directions for future research},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Policy and technology responses to increased temperatures in urban heat
   islands (UHIs) are discussed in a variety of research; however, their
   interaction is overlooked and understudied. This is an important
   oversight because policy and technology are often developed in isolation
   of each other and not in conjunction. Therefore, they have limited
   synergistic effects when aimed at solving global issues. To examine this
   aspect, we conducted a systematic literature review and synthesised 97
   articles to create a conceptual structuring of the topic. We identified
   the following categories: (a) evidence base for policymaking including
   timescale analysis, effective policymaking instruments as well as
   decision support and scenario planning; (b) policy responses including
   landscape and urban form, green and blue area ratio, albedo enhancement
   policies, transport modal split as well as public health and
   participation; (c) passive technologies including green building
   envelopes and development of cool surfaces; and (d) active technologies
   including sustainable transport as well as energy consumption, heating,
   ventilation and air conditioning, and waste heat. Based on the findings,
   we present a framework to guide future research in analysing UHI policy
   and technology responses more effectively in conjunction with each
   other.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper addresses housing problems of coastal areas in
   Bangladesh and investigates container-modular-housing (CMH) as a
   potential sustainable solution that establishes a resilient community.
   Design/methodology/approach Primary data highlight the underlying
   challenges of coastal-housing developed by monitoring the day-to-day
   operations of the community and conducting interviews with community
   members. Secondary data came from existing literature on coastal-housing
   rules and regulations, CMH and similar ideas. The study used a
   hypothetical CMH cluster design, with three primary objectives in mind:
   future settlement re-arrangement, economic sustainability and
   environmental sustainability. To achieve the objectives, the research
   used a comparative examination of the current constructed form and CMH,
   as well as a computer-aided simulation approach. Findings Primary
   findings encompass issues of a given coastal area, including surrounding
   site studies, sustainability and resiliency demands due to broad
   exposure to the natural calamities. Driving toward a ``CMH{''} based
   home design has the ability to create strategies for a resilient and
   sustainable community development while taking three primary objectives
   into account. Research limitations/implications A pilot project is
   needed to analyze the socio-cultural impact and overall construction
   feasibility. Practical implications This research could be implemented
   to transform an informal construction system into a technical,
   resilient, sustainable architectural and engineering solution to build
   resilient communities. Originality/value Numerous research projects have
   focused on the environmental sustainability of CMH. However, this study
   focuses on construction sustainability considering three major aspects
   which are yet to be addressed.},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems are divided into three major groups: boreal,
   temperate, and tropical. These can be subdivided according to the
   particularities of each type due to its relative location (littoral,
   mountain, etc.), climatic conditions, or even geological substrate.
   Climate change affects each type of forest ecosystem differently.
   However, it seems to affect temperate forests in Mediterranean-type
   climate regions more intensely. These regions are located over several
   continents, with major impacts of increased temperature during summer
   and decreased precipitation during winter. This situation affects
   Mediterranean forest ecosystems by increasing the risk of fires, which
   arise more frequently and are more severe. In addition, the emergence of
   pests and the spread of invasive species are well-known problems
   affecting these ecosystems. All of these conditions contribute to losses
   of productivity and biodiversity. To avoid the destruction of forest
   resources, and since Mediterranean-type climate regions are considered
   climate change hot spots with increased vulnerability to disturbances,
   the implementation of adaptive forest management models could contribute
   to increasing the resilience of such forests, which could also
   contribute to mitigating climate change.},

Abstract = {This study presents an event-based storyline framework to assess the
   influence of future climatic and socioeconomic conditions on coastal
   flood impacts to critical infrastructure. The framework combines
   well-established quantitative methods of sea level rise, coastal
   inundation, and critical infrastructure (CI) physical damage assessments
   into an integrated modelling approach. We apply our approach to
   re-imagine three historic events: storm Xaver, storm Xynthia , and a
   storm surge event along the coast of Emilia Romagna (Italy). Our results
   indicate that northern Germany would benefit mostly from coordinated
   adaptation action to reduce the flood impact, whereas the southwestern
   coast of France would find the highest damage reduction through
   asset-level `autonomous' adaptation action. Our approach helps to
   improve the scientific understanding of how coastal flood risk are
   assessed and best managed, and forces a distillation of the science into
   an accessible narrative to support policymakers and asset owners to make
   progress towards more climate-resilient coastal communities.},

Abstract = {Assisted colonization as an adaptation strategy to conserve or restore
   biodiversity in the face of climate change deservedly evokes
   controversy. Assisted colonization is perceived by some as a last option
   for conserving endangered species and by others as a risky and unwise
   management effort due to current gaps of knowledge. Based on the pros
   and cons of the recent debate, we show that the current discussion
   mainly focuses on the assisted colonization of rare and endangered
   species beyond their natural range of distribution. We suggest that a
   more useful approach for the conservation of endangered species could
   occur by focusing on the relevant foundation or keystone species, which
   ensure ecosystem integrity for a multitude of dependent species by
   governing the habitat structure and microclimate of the site. Examples
   of foundation species include dominant tree species in forests or
   dominant corals in coral reefs. For a given conservation or restoration
   need (e.g. conservation of rare species), we recommend the assisted
   colonization of pre-adapted ecotypes of the relevant foundation species
   from climates similar to future expectations for the target site. This
   approach could lead to climate-safe habitats for endangered species with
   minimal adverse effects on recipient ecosystems.},

Title = {Phytoplankton responses to adaptive management interventions in
   eutrophic urban estuaries},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {693},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Upstream anthropogenic perturbations can dramatically affect estuarine
   water quality, especially in small systems where water retention times
   are high. Management of these modified ecosystems often requires direct
   interventions to prevent detrimental long-term effects. The heavily
   urbanized and temporarily dosed Zandvlei Estuary in South Africa has a
   long history of anthropogenic manipulation, and therefore acts as an
   ideal case-study to gauge reactive management practices. Continued
   deterioration of estuarine water quality and ecological functioning
   prompted the adoption of an adaptive management approach. Subsequent
   management interventions to increase salinity variability and nutrient
   removal included the (1) adoption of a mouth management plan, (2)
   regular harvesting of submerged vegetation, and (3) removal of flow
   obstructions. Physico-chemical and nutrient monitoring data (2010-2018)
   were assessed to document the response of phytoplankton to these
   interventions. Time-series analysis indicated an upward trend in
   salinity throughout the estuary. This corresponded with a temporal
   decline in phytoplankton biomass levels and was supported by model
   results that highlighted a strongly inverse relationship with salinity.
   The frequency of high-biomass events (>80 mu g Chl-a l(-1)) also
   declined in each of the designated estuarine zones. In April 2012, an
   extensive harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Prymnesium parvum
   (Prymnesiophyceae) was recorded (similar to 530 mu g Chl-a l(-1)) in the
   estuary, culminating in hypoxic conditions (O-2 < 2 mg l(-1)) and fish
   kills. However, the subsequent mechanical breaching of the mouth has
   prevented reoccurrences of P. parvum. Similarly, more saline conditions
   arising from increased marine connectivity reduced the abundance of the
   previously dominant Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae classes. The
   overall improvement in water quality validates the efficacy of
   management interventions aimed at restoring and conserving ecosystem
   functionality. Yet, these efforts are a deviation from natural estuarine
   functioning and thus a `catchment to coast' approach that incorporates
   upstream nutrient mitigation measures is needed to achieve sustainable
   long-term management objectives. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This study aims to explore climate change induced socio-economic
   vulnerability of mangrove-dependent communities in the Indus Delta. We
   evaluate the linkages between vulnerability indicators by relating a
   community perceptions with observed and projected climate change
   scenarios. In evaluating these linkages, some key questions are
   considered such as: what are the likely socio-economic drivers
   contributing to community's sensitivity? Are these drivers impacting the
   community and how much is the community's coping potential to climate
   change? What are the key adaptation options necessary for increasing the
   community's resilience? This study is carried out in a coastal town
   (Keti Bandar), which is located in the Indus delta. This region is
   highly sensitive to declining fresh water flows, changing climate and
   meager socio-economic resources of local population. We have used the
   Composite Vulnerability Index (CVI) approach in order to draw a general
   picture of the community's vulnerability under a changing climate in
   Keti Bandar. The data for three CVI components (exposure, sensitivity
   and adaptive capacity) are collected at household level through
   questionnaire-based survey in six villages, however for exposure,
   secondary data is also acquired. Our assessment shows that these coastal
   communities, either engaged with the fishery or agriculture sector, are
   not only exposed, but are also highly sensitive to climate change driven
   threats. Moreover, lack of access to basic facilities, inadequate income
   diversification, and low education levels are negatively affecting the
   adaptive capacity of the entire local population. However, the
   communities' nature of dwelling, their strong family networks, and their
   ability to migrate contribute positively to their adaptive capacity. (C)

Title = {Rethinking urban heat stress: Assessing risk and adaptation options
   across socioeconomic groups in Bonn, Germany},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With climate change and socioeconomic trends expected to exacerbate the
   risk of urban heat stress, implementing adaptation measures is paramount
   to limit adverse impacts of heat on urban inhabitants. Identification of
   the best options needs to be based on sound, localised assessments of
   risk, understood as the interaction of hazard, exposure and
   vulnerability. Yet a review of the literature reveals that minimal
   research to date considers the perceived impacts of heat among urban
   residents. Based on a household survey in Bonn, Germany, this paper
   adopts an integrated approach to assess how different socioeconomic
   groups are affected by heat stress and explores the connections between
   perceived impacts of heat and indicators of exposure and vulnerability
   across groups. Results indicate that all socioeconomic groups are at
   risk of urban heat stress, though to differing extents and for different
   reasons. Exposure was found to be lowest in groups typically considered
   to be of higher risk, such as older respondents, who at the same time
   have the highest susceptibility. Students and other younger respondents,
   on the other hand, face comparably high exposure and have the lowest
   coping and adaptive capacities. At the same time, each group has its own
   capacities with the potential to mitigate risk. The study shows that
   urban inhabitants beyond ``classic risk groups{''} usually addressed in
   literature and policy are affected by heat stress in ways that may not
   be accounted for in current urban policy.},

Title = {The Influence of Forums and Multilevel Governance on the Climate
   Adaptation Practices of Australian Organizations},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {To date, there are few regulations and policies relating to climate
   change in Australia. Uncertainty about the timing, structure, and
   potential impact of proposed legislation such as a national carbon
   abatement scheme, is leading to planning delays across the country. To
   assist with these policy uncertainties, organizations can embed
   themselves in multilevel governance frameworks that inform, structure,
   and facilitate strategic development, planning, and action. As part of
   these networks, organizational representatives also engage in formal and
   informal forums, a type of interorganizational relationship, which can
   include industry task forces, policy development committees, interagency
   groups, and specific climate change committees. Forums constitute an
   additional level of governance that influences decision making.
   The patterns of relationships within these multilevel governance
   frameworks are examined in this paper, with a focus on the forum level
   of organizational cooperation. Specifically, we investigate the type of
   forums operating and their role in supporting organizational responses
   to climate change. A series of interviews and focus groups were
   conducted in two study areas, the Swan Canning region of Western
   Australia and the Hunter / Central Coast region of New South Wales. The
   results indicate that organizations participate in a diverse range of
   forums. Further, forums appear to play a key role in the everyday
   business of organizations by enhancing their ability to plan and address
   a range of issues, including those associated with climate change. In
   addition the research highlights some of the barriers and drivers for
   the development and implementation of climate adaptation practices that
   emerge from forum discussions. For example, a lack of government
   guidance in interpreting climate change policy was described as a
   barrier yet access to the knowledge and expertise of participants was
   highlighted as a potential driver. The paper discusses how an ability to
   create new forums and utilize existing nonclimate related forums assists
   organizations in addressing climate change impacts. We contend that
   forums constitute a level of governance deeply embedded in
   organizational practice that influences both their capacity and
   motivation to undertake climate adaptation. Our findings suggest that
   research investigating the rules that govern forums and the structural
   properties of the networks in which they are embedded is required to
   further understand the role of multilevel governance in shaping
   organizational responses to climate change.},

Abstract = {Green infrastructure is well recognized as a key urban climate
   mitigation strategy. In line with this, and following a central

   demonstrates the basis for an alternative approach. Based on a ``new'

   thermal comfort simulations of representative local climate zones (LCZ)
   show that improvements in current green space policy are possible. We
   enumerate a rational basis for specifying green space targets per local
   area based on contextual realities as captured by the LCZ approach. Such
   a nuanced approach to mitigate the human comfort consequences of
   inadvertent urban growth is not only more contextually appropriate but
   also enhances the feasibility of achieving the intended goal of urban

Abstract = {The threat of release of methane sequestered in the circumpolar Arctic
   regions of the world creates the possibility of triggering additional
   feedback effects from the terrestrial and the deep ocean systems which
   could potentially add large amounts of carbon (C) into the atmosphere.
   This paper analyses the implications for C mitigation policy under the
   threats of a substantial permafrost methane release. Several insights
   emerge from the analysis. First, the presence of non-linear feedbacks
   creates a bifurcation zone in the C emissions-stock space, on one side
   of which large accumulations of atmospheric C materialize leading to
   significant damages. Second, the bifurcation line does not have a steep
   slope, implying that it would be possible to avoid falling on the wrong
   side of this zone even if the current atmospheric stock of C were higher
   than what they are today. Third, when the release of permafrost C is
   uncertain, there is benefit in reducing anthropogenic C more than what
   would be optimal under a certain release of the same. Fourth, higher
   abatement cost scenarios do not necessarily imply significantly reduced
   abatement efforts. On the contrary, abatement efforts, which are only
   reduced marginally under this scenario, ensure that long run carbon path
   is stabilized. This is done in order to avoid incurring substantial
   costs of abatement in the future when non-linear feedback effects kick
   in.},

Abstract = {Climate change makes the tourism industry vulnerable, as many of its
   resources will be heavily impacted by its effects. Coastal destinations
   are likely to be the most affected by rising sea levels and extreme
   weather events, calling for a sociospatial analysis of the dynamics of
   peripheral coastal tourism communities. Using a production of space
   framework, we describe how tourism space is produced and (re)produced in
   two Canadian communities located along the St. Lawrence River estuary:
   Tadoussac and Notre-Dame-du-Portage. A case study methodology including
   observation, semistructured interviews, and discourses analysis is
   applied to deconstruct the sociospatial process of climate change
   adaptation. The main findings stress the importance of discourse and
   land tenure strategies used by different stakeholders. Managers of
   publicly owned land tend to make environmental strategies (green
   infrastructure) central to their adaptation strategies, whereas private
   land owners tend to use man-made interventions (grey infrastructure) and
   closing space strategies to protect and enhance their land values in
   response to the increasing threat and evidence of climate change
   impacts. The results call for further research that takes the social
   processes of value creation embedded in land tenure and land markets
   into account.},

Title = {Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific
   assessment},

Abstract = {Black carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's
   climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a
   unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an
   evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its
   inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative
   in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms:
   direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice
   clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated
   with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both
   microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources
   are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid
   fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass.
   Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods
   are 7500 Gg yr(-1) in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to
   29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black
   carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of
   almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era
   (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is
   +0.71 W m(-2) with 90\% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m(-2).
   Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting
   the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W
   m(-2). Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid
   adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying
   climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of
   industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing
   mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m(-2)
   with 90\% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m(-2). Thus, there is a
   very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of
   co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We
   estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W
   m(-2), is the second most important human emission in terms of its
   climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is
   estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also
   emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate.
   Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the
   framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived
   co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are
   included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and
   biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (-0.50 to
   +1.08) W m(-2) during the first year after emission. For a few of these
   sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels,
   warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from
   these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling).
   When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter,
   are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era
   climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich
   sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m(-2) with 90\% uncertainty
   bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m(-2)).
   The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources
   are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud
   interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In
   prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science
   factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and
   implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of
   black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the
   feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the
   large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative
   processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to
   improve future climate forcing estimates.},

Title = {Influence of climate change on summer cooling costs and heat stress in
   urban office buildings},

Volume = {144},

Abstract = {Indoor climatic conditions are strongly influenced by outdoor
   meteorological conditions. It is thus expected that the combined effect
   of climate change and the urban heat island effect negatively influences
   working conditions in urban office buildings. Since office buildings are
   particularly vulnerable to overheating because of the profound internal
   heat gains, this is all the more relevant. The overheating in office
   buildings leads to elevated cooling costs or, because additional work
   breaks are required by legislation in some countries, productivity
   losses. We have developed a methodology incorporating urban climate
   modelling and building energy simulations to assess cooling costs and
   lost working hours in office buildings, both for current-day and future
   climate, extending towards the end of the twenty-first century. The
   methodology is tailored to additionally assess the impact and benefits
   of adaptation measures, and it is designed to be transferable from one
   city to another. Results for a prototype building located in three
   different European cities (Antwerp, Bilbao and London) illustrate the
   challenge in keeping Western-European office buildings comfortable until
   the end of the twenty-first century without adaptation measures, and the
   beneficial effect of adequate adjustments. The results further
   illustrate the large decreases in cooling costs (up to 30\%) caused by
   the introduction of (external) shading and increased night-time
   ventilation in actively cooled buildings, and the improvements in
   working conditions in free-running buildings caused by moving workers to
   cooler locations and splitting workdays in morning and evening shifts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The Marine Environment Protection Committee has introduced the Energy
   Efficiency Existing Ship Index, which will enter into force in 2023, to
   reduce emissions from existing ships. Since many existing ships do not
   comply with the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index requirements,
   certain mitigation measures must be applied to reduce carbon dioxide
   emissions. In this study, an analysis of slow steaming for fulfilling
   these requirements is carried out using the example of containerships
   built until 2016 employing the analytic model. The required speed
   reduction for ships which do not meet the Energy Efficiency Existing
   Ship Index requirements is quantified, and the potential problems
   related to long-term sailing with reduced speed are highlighted. The
   relationship between ship speed and fuel consumption for Post Panamax,
   Post Panamax Plus, and Very Large Containership fleets is analysed. The
   obtained results highlight the significance of potential implementation
   issues of each mitigation measure to achieve sustainable growth of the

Abstract = {On both local and global scales, the expectation of climate
   change-related adverse impacts and changing human vulnerabilities
   presents a new challenge for the public health sector's adaptation. Our
   aim is to present ``transfrontier{''} learning as one of the effective
   case-and place-specific options towards adapting to climate change
   consequences.
   Human societies and nature have always adjusted to climate variability
   and extreme weather events, but climate change is moving climate
   conditions outside the range of past human experiences. Although climate
   change will create advantages for some regions and subpopulations, it
   will adversely affect ecosystems, water resources, energy,
   transportation, population health, public security, and other sectors.
   Like other parts of the world, the province of Quebec (Canada) has not
   been spared by negative impacts related to these recent climate change
   conditions. For Quebecer public health professionals, climate change is
   a significant threat in learning to adapt to its negative effects on
   human health. These range from the direct effects of average warming and
   urban heat islands, ozone air pollution, wildfires, summer/winter
   storms, and UV exposures to the indirect effects resulting from changes
   in water supply or in vector-borne diseases. In particular, climate
   change affects mental and physical health trough modifications in the
   frequency, intensity and duration of extreme meteorological events.
   While the frequency of extreme cold events is expected to decrease, heat
   waves are increasing. Depending on the effectiveness and extent of
   adaptation options, heat-related morbidity and mortality could increase
   over coming decades. Another set of major impacts is related to warmer
   air temperatures and higher atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations,
   increasing pollen production and lengthening the pollen season.
   Faced with such major and varied effects, preparedness is crucial in
   public health. Two key messages are here highlighted: (1) a
   ``transfrontier{''} vision of ecoLearning and knowledge
   transfer/translation is needed. We cannot satisfy ourselves with
   sectorial approaches in helping societies to adapt to climate change
   because of the complex interactions between these climatic changes and
   non-climatic factors such as demographics, economics, land use, and
   technology; (2) a sustained effort to educate actors from various
   sectors (health professionals and decision-makers; the public sector;
   the private sector; non-governmental organizations) and to inform the
   adult population, especially the younger generations, is crucial to
   promote a behavioural change.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},

Volume = {1},

Pages = {53-59},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change will pose new challenges to conserving Earth's natural
   ecosystems, due to incremental changes in temperature and weather
   patterns, and to increased frequency and intensity of extreme climate
   events. Addressing these challenges will require pragmatic conservation
   actions informed by site-specific understanding of susceptibility to
   climate change and capacity of societies to cope with and adapt to
   change. Depending on a location's environmental susceptibility and
   social adaptive capacity, appropriate conservation actions will require
   some combination of: (1) large-scale protection of ecosystems; (2)
   actively transforming and adapting social-ecological systems; (3)
   building the capacity of communities to cope with change; and (4)
   government assistance focused on de-coupling communities from dependence
   on natural resources. We apply a novel analytical framework to examine
   conservation actions in five western Indian Ocean countries, where
   climate-mediated disturbance has impacted coral reefs and where adaptive
   capacity differs markedly. We find that current conservation strategies
   do not reflect adaptive capacity and are, therefore, ill prepared for
   climate change. We provide a vision for conservation policies that
   considers social adaptive capacity that copes with complexities of
   climate change better than the singular emphasis on government control
   and the creation of no-take areas.},

Abstract = {New terminology is needed for the assessment of wetland restoration
   projects, focusing on progress towards ecological goals rather than the
   yes/no alternative of success versus failure. Mitigation projects should
   be evaluated based on `compliance' of specific mitigation criteria.
   Peer-reviewed assessments of wetland restoration projects have focused
   on appropriate parameters (topographic, hydrologic, soil, vegetation,
   and animal components); however, for the most part, they have evaluated
   small, newly restored wetlands over the short-term with little repeated
   sampling. Future assessments should focus on understanding problems at a
   particular site by identifying cause-effect mechanisms. We review a case
   study from San Diego Bay where detailed assessments led to the
   identification of problems and subsequent management alternatives. We
   also recommend the use of two novel approaches: experimentation and the
   evaluation of ecosystem resiliency to unplanned disturbances. These
   assessments will provide a better understanding of ecosystem functioning
   and enhance current comparisons of natural and restored systems. A
   stronger science base for wetland restoration and adaptive management do
   not guarantee that restoration targets will be reached; however, these
   approaches will identify the causes of problems and allow us to predict
   whether or not restoration targets can be leached in a timely manner.

Abstract = {The Nueces River System has been subject to adaptive management since
   construction of the Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1982. A special condition
   required the City of Corpus Christi to provide not less than 185 million
   cubic meters (151,000 ac-ft) of water per year to the Nueces Estuary
   through a combination of spills, releases, and return flows to maintain
   ecological health and productivity of living marine resources. However,
   no releases were made and salinities in Nueces Bay increased to
   hypersaline conditions during the drought period of 1988-1990 and the
   estuary was inverted where fresher water entered the delta on high
   tides. In contrast, the bay historically supported populations of shrimp
   and oysters generally requiring salinities in the range of 10-20 ppt.
   Beginning in May 1990, the Texas Water Commission issued a series of
   Orders requiring the City to meet the special conditions contained in
   their water right permit and provide for freshwater inflows to the
   estuary. Since 1990, a series of restoration activities, monitoring and
   experimental studies, and Order amendments has resulted in a stakeholder
   driven process that increased environmental health while providing a
   sustainable water supply to the region. However, with climate change and
   continued development, more changes are likely to occur in the future.
   The lesson learned is that the goal of achieving consensus can occur
   with a blend and balance of science and a stakeholder decision process.},

Title = {Seabird bycatch mitigation trials in artisanal demersal longliners of
   the Western Mediterranean},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {High numbers of seabirds are killed annually worldwide in longline
   fisheries. In the Mediterranean, this mortality is seriously affecting
   the viability of seabird populations, in particular of the three endemic
   shearwaters. Even so, there is currently no specific seabird mitigation
   requirements for the longline fleet operating in this area. From 2013 to
   2014, we assessed the efficiency and practical applicability of four
   mitigation measures on artisanal demersal longliners targeting European
   hake (Merluccius merluccius) in the western Mediterranean: night
   setting, tori line, weighted lines and artificial baits. We performed
   fifty-two pairs of experimental (with the tested mitigation measure) and
   control settings (without any measure), and compared their effects on
   seabird interactions and fish catches. In addition, we estimated the
   longline sink rates and the seabird access area to baited hooks in
   different longline configurations. Night setting reduced bycatch risk
   without affecting target and noncommercial fish catches. The tori line
   may have reduced the bycatch risk by displacing bait attacks beyond the
   end of the line, but at this distance shearwaters could still access to
   the baits and the streamers did not deter birds under calm wind
   conditions. Weighted lines increased sink rate, but it resulted in only
   a minor reduction of the seabird access window to baited hooks and led
   to some operational problems during the setting. Artificial baits
   substantially reduced commercial catches. Moreover, the seabird access
   to the baited hooks was influenced by the longline configuration, the
   setting speed and the relative position to the floats and weights. So
   far, night setting stands out as the best mitigation measure for
   reducing bycatch levels without compromising target catches in demersal
   longliners. Ideally, these results should be confirmed in longliners
   targeting species other than European hake.},

Title = {A rising tide of adaptation action: Comparing two coastal regions of
   Aotearoa-New Zealand},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {Diverse and contested local interests and the complexity of climate
   change make adaptation to climate change risks at the coast challenging.
   Even in similar settings, adaptation experiences and prospects can
   differ markedly. Why? This paper provides empirical evidence of
   comparative adaptation experiences in two regions of Aotearoa-New
   Zealand the Coromandel Peninsula and the Hawke's Bay coast. We
   critically examine how local barriers and enablers influence the
   trajectory of adaptation in two regions that face similar risks, have
   essentially the same institutional architecture, and yet have had very
   different adaptation experiences. We investigate the situational
   differences and similarities, and their implications for adaptation in
   each region. We found that the evolution of adaptation is shaped by the
   perceptions of the actors, especially local authority leaders, and
   opportunities that arise at a context-specific point in time. Such
   perceptions and opportunities can amount to barriers in one location and
   enablers in another. Growing concern about coastal hazard risk,
   improving levels of trust and legitimacy, community engagement, and
   collaborative governance were key to innovative long-term adaptation
   planning in the Hawke's Bay but their absence has led to short-term
   business as usual practices in the Coromandel. Yet even in the latter
   case, change is underway and longer-term adaptation planning is
   commencing. We conclude that there is a `rising tide' of adaptation
   action in the face of escalating climate risk - with long-term planning
   and local action triggered by cumulative hazard experience and / or
   extreme events that raise public concern and make climate change salient
   to local community members and leaders. Both local and regional
   interests and concerns shape local response appetites. Proactive, local
   authority-led engagement and long-term strategic planning are
   foundational for mobilizing effective adaptation responses. Enabling
   national policy, guidance and institutional provisions are key to
   prompting and sustaining such efforts, and to facilitating broad
   consistency in locally appropriate responses. Notwithstanding efforts to
   foster locally appropriate but nationally aligned adaptation responses,
   our research shows that coastal communities and their local authorities
   follow pathways consistent with local risk appetites, understanding
   about climate change, and the political will and capacity of local
   government to mobilize key governance actors around long-term strategic
   planning.},

Title = {Examining legal and regulatory barriers to climate change adaptation in
   the coastal zone of the United States},
Journal = {COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of key legal and regulatory instruments
   in the United States that impact climate adaptation planning. The
   analysis is framed within a social-institutional context, meaning the
   legal-regulatory environment is viewed from the perspective of the
   practices and norms that are created through existing laws and policies.
   Those norms and practices are then compared to current best practices
   for coastal climate adaptation to determine if and where divergence
   between recommended best practices and existing policy structures
   occurs. The results of this analysis suggest key policy instruments
   cumulatively act as barriers to adopting climate change assessment
   recommendations in coastal regions. The main causes for this disconnect
   between information and action seem to be historical path dependence,
   clear counter-incentives favoring coastal development, and multiple
   narratives of climate change, all of which diminish a unified public
   demand for coastal adaptation. Enumerated lessons presented from this
   analysis can be used as conceptual starting points when thinking about
   translating assessments of climate change into public action. In
   particular, the social-institutional framework provides an analytical
   construct for gaining insight into how existing legal and regulatory
   instruments influence adoption of proposed adaptation strategies,
   including highlighting when divergence between existing and proposed
   policies occurs.},

Title = {Colonial dynamics limit climate adaptation in Oceania: Perspectives from
   the Marshall Islands},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the island states of Oceania, colonial power dynamics profoundly
   shape climate vulnerability and response. Largely as a result of their
   colonial history, island nations are dependent on outside funders to
   adapt to climate change, reproducing colonial subordination by depriving
   island states of sovereignty over their adaptation strategies. We
   empirically demonstrate the sovereignty-depriving effects of the current
   adaptation process through a case study from the Republic of the
   Marshall Islands (RMI). Recent scholarship suggests that, without swift
   and large-scale adaptation, RMI will be uninhabitable by mid-century,
   threatening a population-scale forced migration. Our research indicates
   that Marshallese leaders are committed to adapting in place in order to
   preserve national identity and sovereignty, but they view reliance on
   external funding as a major barrier to implementing the measures that
   could enable RMI to survive in the face of climate change. Marshallese
   decision-makers in this study perceive that aid institutions discount
   the existential implications of failing to pursue aggressive adaptation,
   assuming instead that migration is inevitable, economically rational,
   and even desirable. Such a proposal is particularly painful given the
   history of forced migration in RMI caused by U.S. nuclear weapons
   testing there. These neocolonial dynamics not only deprive island states
   of sovereignty over their adaptation strategies but also threaten
   permanent abrogation of national sovereignty and selfdetermination
   through loss of a habitable territory. To uphold global commitments to
   decolonization and human rights, our research indicates the need to
   return sovereignty over climate adaptation decision-making to affected
   states.},

Abstract = {Effective translation of the viral genome during the infection cycle
   most likely enhances its fitness. In this study, we reveal two different
   strategies employed by cyanophages, viruses infecting cyanobacteria, to
   enhance their translation efficiency. Cyanophages of the T7-like
   Podoviridae family adjust their GC content and codon usage to those of
   their hosts. In contrast, cyanophages of the T4-like Myoviridae family
   maintain genomes with low GC content, thus sometimes differing from that
   of their hosts. By introducing their own specific set of tRNAs, they
   appear to modulate the tRNA pools of hosts with tRNAs that fit the viral
   low GC preferred codons. We assessed the possible effects of those viral
   tRNAs on cyanophages and cyanobacterial genomes using the tRNA
   adaptation index, which measures the extent to which a given pool of
   tRNAs translates efficiently particular genes. We found a strong
   selective pressure to gain and maintain tRNAs that will boost
   translation of myoviral genes when infecting a high GC host, contrasted
   by a negligible effect on the host genes. Thus, myoviral tRNAs may
   represent an adaptive strategy to enhance fitness when infecting high GC
   hosts, thereby potentially broadening the spectrum of hosts while
   alleviating the need to adjust global parameters such as GC content for
   each specific host.},

Abstract = {High energy waves intensify the impacts of sea level rise and threaten
   coastal communities, requiring measures to prevent harmful consequences.
   Vulnerability assessments using NOAA's assessment guide were performed
   in a high wave environment, accounting for the impacts of sea level rise
   on coastal inundation, longshore transport, benthic habitat as well as
   on beach users and homeowners. This case study of the North Shore region
   of Oahu, Hawai'i' uses multi-criteria evaluation and cost-benefit
   analysis based on vulnerabilities, impacts, and protective actions such
   as shoreline hardening, beach nourishment and dunes, vegetative cover,
   and elevation or relocation of structures. Geomorphology and natural
   habitats dramatically affect coastal exposure in high energy wave
   environments. The most viable adaptation strategies include expansion of
   artificial reefs in benthic habitat dominated areas while the vegetative
   cover and beach nourishment are most appropriate in developed locations
   and surf tourism areas. Suitable adaptation strategies were determined
   based on differences in the biophysical environment and community
   perceptions. The value of this approach lies in both a generalized
   method for compiling and analyzing large amounts of data as well as
   customizing the proposed framework to identify crucial elements
   necessary for effective adaptation to sea level rise in high-energy wave
   environments.},

Abstract = {The marine environment is affected by climate change in many ways but it
   is also affected by the separate problem of ocean acidification (OA).
   Anthropogenic carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the ocean causes
   changes in ocean chemistry including an increase in acidity. Fisheries
   and shellfish industries, which are vital livelihoods for some
   communities have already been affected by OA. As there has been little
   research conducted to examine public risk perceptions of this issue, the
   aim was to explore this through a survey (N = 954) carried out in the
   UK. The survey explored a range of psychological factors including
   concern, place attachment, and environmental identity that are known to
   influence risk perceptions. A regression analysis found that more
   concerned participants had stronger environmental identities and higher
   levels of knowledge about OA. As predicted, they also felt more attached
   to the ocean and felt more negative about OA. It was clear that place
   attachment and environmental identity were important factors and thus
   should not be neglected when developing risk communications,
   particularly for this unfamiliar risk issue. As unfamiliar and complex
   risks such as OA are becoming more prevalent and must be communicated
   successfully in a world full of conflicting information, it is important
   to consider how OA is perceived by the public and how this can inform
   policy decisions in future. If major mitigation and adaptation
   strategies are adopted by policymakers the success of these will also
   ultimately require society to accept them.},

Title = {Improving Development Outcomes and Reducing Disaster Risk through
   Planned Community Relocation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The idea of relocation as a transformative disaster risk reduction,
   climate adaptation, and development strategy follows the assumption that
   relocation reduces the vulnerability of communities. Yet, it is unclear
   whose and what kind of vulnerability is reduced through relocation, and
   which factors are important in determining the success of relocation
   efforts as strategies for development, climate change adaptation (CCA),
   and disaster risk reduction (DRR). Temporary and short distance
   relocation is highly likely to achieve increased resilience by reducing
   exposure, but relocation to a new area and new communities brings a
   range of issues. CCA and DRR use different timescales and focal points
   regarding relocation: CCA focuses on future mass permanent relocation
   and the subsequent potential loss of cultures and identities mainly due
   to projected sea level rise. The DRR community focuses on temporary
   relocation as a way to reduce exposure to a range of hazards, although
   it is also involved in permanent movement as a transformative way to
   reduce risk and enhance development. We explore these differences in
   this paper, with examples mainly from the Pacific Small Island
   Developing States where past relocations have been numerous. Better
   understanding and articulation of the underlying assumptions and
   preferences in CCA, DRR, and development discourses on planned community
   relocation could provide a richer context for future planning and
   dealing with both slow-onset and sudden disasters.},

Abstract = {The article reports projection of malaria by 2030 using A1B scenario of
   PRECIS model basically derived from HadRM3. Malaria scenario has been
   defined in terms of opening of months of malaria transmission based on
   minimum required temperature and relative humidity for baseline
   (1961-1990) and by 2030. Detailed analysis has been done for four
   vulnerable sectors, viz. Himalayan region, northeast, the Western Ghats
   and coastal region. Some parts of Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and
   Arunachal Pradesh are likely to open transmission windows in new
   districts with increase in 4-6 months category of transmission. In the
   northeastern states, intensity of transmission is projected to increase
   from 7-9 months to 10-12 months. The Western Ghats is projected to be
   affected to a minimum, whereas in the east coastal districts, reduction
   in transmission months is likely due to increased temperature. As
   malaria transmission dynamics is multi-factorial, driven by agricultural
   practices, water availability, urbanization, migration, socioeconomic
   conditions and intervention measures, projections based on climatic
   parameters alone should not be viewed with certainty rather they are for
   guidelines for preparedness in vulnerable areas and strengthen health
   infrastructure, effective health education and use of best available
   tools of intervention to cope with the threat of climate change.},

Abstract = {Political leaders in numerous nations argue for an upper limit of the
   global average surface temperature of 2 K above the pre-industrial
   level, in order to attempt to avoid the most serious impacts of climate
   change. This paper analyzes what this limit implies in terms of
   radiative forcing, emissions pathways and abatement costs, for a range
   of assumptions on rate of ocean heat uptake and climate sensitivity. The
   primary aim is to analyze the importance of ocean heat uptake for
   radiative forcing pathways that temporarily overshoot the long-run
   stabilization forcing, yet keep the temperature increase at or below the
   2 K limit. In order to generate such pathways, an integrated
   climate-economy model, MiMiC, is used, in which the emissions pathways
   generated represent the least-cost solution of stabilizing the global
   average surface temperature at 2 K above the pre-industrial level. We
   find that the level of overshoot can be substantial. For example, the
   level of overshoot in radiative forcing in 2100 ranges from about 0.2 to
   1 W/m2, where the value depends strongly and positively on the effective
   diffusivity of heat in the oceans. Measured in relative terms, the level
   of radiative forcing overshoot above its longrun equilibrium level in
   2100 is 20\% to 60\% for high values of climate sensitivity (i.e., about
   4.5 K) and 8\% to 30\% for low values of climate sensitivity (i.e.,
   about 2 K). In addition, for cases in which the radiative forcing level
   can be directly stabilized at the equilibrium level associated with a
   specific climate sensitivity and the 2 K limit, the net present value
   abatement cost is roughly cut by half if overshoot pathways are
   considered instead of stabilization of radiative forcing at the
   equilibrium level without an overshoot.},

Abstract = {This study explores the dilemma of whether to rebuild or relocate from
   the areas devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Since disasters
   represent the discernible manifestation of other complex coastal
   hazards, they offer a window of opportunity to engage residents in the
   dialogue on relocation as sometimes the most effective risk reduction
   strategy. The following research evaluates attitudes towards relocation
   and willingness to consider buyout among 46 surveyed households located
   in highly-affected communities five months after Sandy. It also gauges
   perceptions of coastal risks and recovery concerns as drivers of
   relocation, the level of support for different adaptation strategies,
   and preferences related to the relocation process itself on how and
   where to relocate and with what type of assistance. Responses indicate
   that, even though residents prefer structural solutions to address
   coastal hazards, they are not fully opposed to the possibility of
   relocation mostly for personal health and safety reasons.},

Abstract = {The West African coast is vulnerable to natural hazards and human
   interventions. Although various measures have been taken at different
   scales, mostly at the local level, there is a need to improve management
   at the regional level. We examine these actions and possible solutions
   from different perspectives and provide conclusions and recommendations
   on the integration of solutions to improve coastal management. From
   North West Mauritania to across the Gulf of Guinea a system of coastal
   zoning that can be managed holistically is encouraged. The development
   of holistic planning is seen as a sustainable approach to management
   that seeks to link users/processes together rather than focus on a
   single particular issue and solution. Strengthening, monitoring,
   promoting the observation network and generalising open data
   centralisation and exchange for a better understanding of coastal
   dynamics and pressures is encouraged. There is a need for capacity
   building, expertise and federative actions. Furthermore, the need to
   identify and involve not only stakeholders, but also communities and
   scientists with multilevel inputs. All must agree on coordinated plans
   to achieve stakeholder objectives, using an approach adapted to the
   multi-spatial scale (e.g at the scale of sediment cells, integrating
   from the sources of sediment in river basins to their redistribution
   along the coast, perturbed by climate changes and anthropic stresses),
   so that only regional solutions are appropriate and will be effective.
   These must follow sustainable strategies with a multi-temporal sequenced
   solution and anticipate changes, or adaptive solutions using solutions
   in synergy with different time frames as well as managing natural and
   human systems responsibly. A plan that considers changes in coastal
   systems and anticipates impacts and adapts plans accordingly will be
   key.},

   increase in temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and plant canopy
   growth would increase incidence of Botrytis bunch rot in grapes. Rains
   and cloudy weather just before harvest can increase post-harvest
   spoilage in all the fruits. Wind and insect scarring affect fruit
   quality and fruit become unmarketable. Evaporative cooling of fruit on
   trees through sprinklers and Sunburn protectant spray can reduce sunburn
   in apple,that is, 0.2\% sunburn in treated fruit as compared to 10.8\%
   in control. Frost damages have been reported in Aonla and Ber due to
   unusual low temperatures in northwest India. After chilling temperatures
   at maturity, postharvest losses in avocado have increased. In mandarins
   grown under higher temperatures, color development is poor with less
   acidity while rains and hailstorms during maturity increased postharvest
   losses. Rains have increased losses in acid lime due to rotting and
   splitting. With increasing temperature due to climate change, cold chain
   has become unavoidable and it is must. Higher market standards of
   importing countries may also lead to wastage as produce that does not
   meet size, shape or appearance criteria has to be disposed of at throw
   away prices. Airfreighted fruit has more carbon footprint and may face
   trade-barrier and sea-freight protocols need to be developed. Green and
   ecofriendly postharvest technologies will help mitigate warming impact.
   Changing conditions demand orientation of postharvest strategy to
   improve infrastructure to reduce losses and increase availability of
   produce. Utilization of damaged fruit, strengthening of processing
   infrastructure, and cottage scale and home scale processing need to be
   strengthened. Several issues about postharvest research, policy and
   development need rethinking and action in the face of climatic change
   that are going to affect our lives in coming decades.},

Abstract = {To build 21st century sustainable cities, officials are installing
   alternative infrastructure technologies to reduce atmospheric
   environmental problems such as the urban heat island (UHI). The purpose
   of this study is to further our understanding of how ground-level UHI
   mitigation strategies in compact urban areas impact air temperatures.
   The term `cool pavement' refers to both reflective and porous pavements.
   While cool pavements are identified as UHI mitigation strategies, we
   evaluated their in-situ effectiveness on air and surface temperatures.
   Using a case-control research design, we measured the impact of these
   pavements on air temperature relative to conventional asphalt in alleys.
   In locations where high vertical walls constrained the release of solar
   radiation, reflective pavements increased air temperatures. In two
   neighborhoods, reflective concrete increased daytime 3-meter air
   temperatures by 0.9 degrees C and 0.5 degrees C respectively and had no
   influence on nighttime temperatures. Unlike reflective pavement, porous
   pavements permit percolation and may contribute to cooling through
   evaporation. However, our research illustrated that porous asphalt and
   porous concrete increased maximum daytime air temperatures by 0.8
   degrees C and 0.5 degrees C and did not lower nighttime air
   temperatures. While porous concrete pavers had significantly warmer
   midday air temperatures, it was the only cool pavement strategy to yield
   lower early evening air temperatures relative to conventional asphalt.
   Even immediately after rain events, the air temperatures above the
   porous pavements were not significantly cooler. This research
   demonstrates our need to evaluate real world installations of cool
   pavement to determine their actual impact on decreasing summertime
   temperatures. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Nonlinear effects of climate change on phosphorus stability in wetlands:
   Concept and estimation},

Year = {2007},

Abstract = {Effects of climate change on ecosystems like freshwater wetlands cannot
   be understood without focusing research on getting sense of
   vulnerability and resiliency at the systemic level, involving tipping
   points, rapid changes in events and states, because of the
   interdependency of various components that are subject to nonlinear
   changes even though they may exert significant inertia to short-term
   hydro-climatic fluctuations. Depending on resilience, threshold and lag
   times, hydro-climatic changes brought upon by global climate change may
   cause nonlinear and/or irreversible changes in phosphorus (P) dynamic,
   and instigate P enrichment in freshwater wetlands. Thus, the studies of
   the influence of expected global climate change and its direct and
   indirect effects on bioavailability/stability of organic P in wetlands
   are in critical need to help manage or increase the resilience of
   wetland ecosystem against any abrupt or irreversible changes that may
   adversely affect the ecosystem and its services. Phosphorus dynamic in
   freshwater wetland system is likely to behave nonlinearly due to
   expected changes in temperature, and sediment/soil and water acidity and
   redox status because of global climate change in the decades to come,
   thereby freshwater wetland, a sensitive ecosystem that plays critical
   role ranging from water quality management to atmospheric CO2 removal,
   could face irreversible or hysteretic adverse changes. The overall
   objectives of this paper are to provide consolidated information on
   identification and estimation of any nonlinear behaviors in the
   stability/bioavailability of various P forms, which are present in water
   columns, detritus and soils/sediments, at different levels of stressors
   in light of changing global climate. Addressing how stable organic P is,
   and at what threshold level and lag time would organic P behave
   nonlinearly and release back into the water column, in turn, exacerbate
   eutrophic conditions, are crucial. Learning the resilience, threshold
   level and lag times allows us to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of
   our technological advances and policies that may help us to cope with
   nonlinear impacts of global climate change on ecosystems such as
   wetlands. The relationships developed between P mobilization processes,
   stressors' levels and lag time can provide invaluable insights for the
   formulation of management strategies that could increase resilience in
   freshwater wetlands, which may be subjected to nonlinear ecological
   responses.},

Abstract = {In an effort to modernize training, the United States Navy and Marine
   Corps have placed an emphasis on identifying effective, learner-centric
   instructional methods. One avenue is to apply individualized training
   techniques, such as adaptive sequencing to flashcard-based study, a
   popular tool used for independent study. Therefore, the goal of this
   research was to compare two adaptive sequencing methods to identify the
   most efficient and effective approach for long-term retention.
   Participants learned armored vehicle identification in one of three
   conditions, 1) Adaptive Response-Time Based-Sequencing (ARTS), which
   uses accuracy and reaction time to prioritize flashcards adaptively, 2)
   Leitner, which uses accuracy to create decks and prioritize flashcards
   adaptively, and 3) Random, which was the control condition that
   sequenced the flashcards randomly. We found no differences between the
   three conditions in terms of learning efficiency and delayed learning
   gains. However, we found that participants in the Leitner condition
   completed training significantly faster those in the other conditions.
   After controlling for in-training measures, we found participants in the
   Leitner condition had the lowest delayed learning gains and there were
   no significant differences between the ARTS and Random conditions. These
   data suggest that the ``efficiency{''} associated with the Leitner
   condition translated to the worst long-term retention. Additionally,
   neither adaptive approach outperformed the random sequencing condition,
   suggesting that random sequencing may provide its own spacing due to the
   number of cards in the deck. More research is needed to determine
   whether adaptive sequencing provides added value as an adaptive approach
   for single-session flashcard study.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This study assessed the combined influences of climate change and
   urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat
   island (SUHI) in the Bangkok metropolitan region (BKK) and Ho Chi Minh
   City metropolitan area (HCM) during 1990-2020. We found climate change
   evidence from trends and variations of temperature extremes in both
   cities throughout the past three decades, especially for the significant
   upward trends of nighttime temperature in HCM (0.23 - 0.3 degrees
   C/decade). These cities have been undergoing rapid urbanization, in
   which HCM has a higher urbanization rate with an annual growth rate of
   8.03\%/year against BKK (4.26\%/year). Landscape metrics have rapidly
   shifted towards urban aggregation and green space fragmentation along
   with urbanization. A peer comparison shows that BKK holds a greater
   urban size and LST intensity, while HCM leads in urban growth and SUHI
   magnitude. These changes jointly contribute to climbing SUHI intensity,
   especially the dramatic influence of surface changes. Yet, temperature
   extremes also play an indispensable role in regulating SUHI magnitude,
   in which the impact in HCM is considerable compared to the effect in
   BKK. The research findings provide crucial information for both cities -
   where incorporation of climate change resilience strategies and SUHI
   mitigation into the master plans for livable cities are recommended.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Insights from traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of the marine
   environment are difficult to integrate into conventional science
   knowledge (CSK) initiatives. Where TEK is integrated into CSK at all, it
   is usually either marginalized or restricted to CSK modes of
   interpretation, hence limiting its potential contribution to the
   understanding of social-ecological systems. This study uses
   semi-directive interviews, direct observations, and structured
   open-ended questionnaires (n = 103) to explore TEK of marine ecological
   changes occurring within the Mafia Island Marine Park, Tanzania, and
   factors contributing to these changes. It illuminates TEK insights that
   can be valuable in parallel with CSK to provide a more nuanced
   understanding of ecological changes. In some areas, fishers observed
   coral reef growth, increased fish abundance, and increased sea
   temperatures, whereas in others, they reported decreases in sea level,
   coral cover, fish abundance, catch composition, catch quantities, and
   fish size. They associated these changes with interrelated factors
   emanating from environmental processes, conservation outcomes, marketing
   constraints, population dynamics, and disappearance of cultural
   traditions. Utilizing TEK without restricting it to CSK modes of
   interpretation has the potential to improve CSK initiatives by promoting
   complementarity and mutual enrichment between the two kinds of
   knowledge, thereby contributing new insights that may enhance adaptive
   management and resilience in social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Grounds for a safety level approach in the development of long-lasting
   regulations based on costs to reduce fatalities for sustaining
   industrial fishing vessel fleets},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {113},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Industrial Fishing is a hard and dangerous working environment which, in
   terms of fatalities, often transcends other working domains. Therefore,
   how safety at sea regulatory measures applied to fishing vessels have
   reduced the risk of fatalities remains to be a key question. This
   research focuses on assessing the societal risks to establish whether
   the current situation is acceptable in the EU and in the rest of the
   world. It estimates the necessary risk reductions that must take place
   for the safety measures in the EU to be cost and benefit effective after
   their implementation. This paper also examines the gap to allow to
   measure risk reductions for a safety level approach, calculates the
   current safety level and identifies a way for developing effective
   safety measures to contribute towards the sustainability of industrial
   fishing vessels. The paper concludes that, although the fatalities per
   industrial fishing vessel per year in the EU have been reduced due to
   the introduction of new industrial fishing vessels, the current
   situation is not yet acceptable. There is a need for standardised
   accident reporting and analysis of information to measure risk
   reductions in terms of fatalities and to develop suitable risk models
   for long lasting and measurable regulations.},

Title = {Making space for experiential knowledge in climate change adaptation?
   Insights from municipal planning officers in Bohol, Philippines},

Abstract = {Climate change is a global phenomenon that has multiple local effects on
   people and places. Yet, climate change knowledge often travels
   uncomfortably across scales and needs constant re-interpretation as it
   is applied in different spatial contexts. This requires the examination
   of how scientific and local knowledge about climate change travel across
   social systems and shape local meanings and adaptive actions on climate
   change. Using an interpretive social science analysis of environmental
   change, this study investigates development planning as a key boundary
   object for handling both kinds of knowledge and explores experiential
   knowledge of climate change held by planning officers from the coastal
   landscape of the island province of Bohol, Philippines. Drawing upon
   face-to-face interviews, mental maps, and planning documents review,
   main results first characterise three experiential ways of knowing about
   climate change across spaces of lived experiences and spaces of maps and
   plans. Then, we show how planners engage with climate change adaptation
   by combining national, techno-scientific and local, on-the-ground ways
   of knowing, offering a venue in which experiential knowledge on climate
   change is used for building planning significance and making more
   grounded accounts of adaptation moving forward in planning policy and
   practice.},

Abstract = {Global warming and climate change are extreme weather phenomena that
   lead to an exponential increase in destructive hurricanes causing severe
   flooding and critical damage to infrastructure systems in coastal
   cities. It is critical to explore and adopt innovative and effective
   resilient design strategies such as Safe-to-Fail for infrastructure
   systems to reduce disaster damages. This study aims to (1) collect the
   Safe-to-Fail strategies from literature and aggregate them; and (2)
   evaluate the aggregated Safe-to-Fail criteria to determine the most
   suitable criteria for reinforcing infrastructure resilience in coastal
   cities. This study utilized a multi-criterion decision-making tool
   Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the resulting weights indicate
   that the highest-ranked criterion is Redundancy (38.88\%), followed by
   Resource efficiency (24.35\%), Adaptability (24.21\%), and
   Multifunctionality (12.55\%). The findings of this research facilitate
   the implementation of Safe-to-Fail infrastructure systems to mitigate
   flood risks and support decision-makers in selecting resilient flood
   solution alternatives, particularly for coastal cities.},

Title = {Addressing fisheries bycatch in a changing world},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Fisheries bycatch is a threat to species of marine megafauna across the
   world's oceans. Work over the past several decades has greatly advanced
   our understanding of the species affected, the magnitude and the spatial
   extent of bycatch. In the same time period, there have been substantial
   advances in the development of mitigation strategies and best practices
   to reduce bycatch. In this paper, we take stock of bycatch knowledge and
   science to address the critical question ``Where do we go from here?{''}
   First, we review the current state of global bycatch science, including
   bycatch rate estimation and biological effects of bycatch, and bycatch
   mitigation practices and gear. We then identify knowledge gaps as well
   as socio-cultural constraints that hamper effective knowledge transfer
   or implementation, and discuss emerging transdisciplinary approaches to
   address these issues. Finally, we discuss the need to consider bycatch
   in a changing ocean and socio-cultural context where species,
   ecosystems, and people are responding to multiple stressors and dynamic
   conditions. As the field of bycatch research moves into the twenty-first
   century, a new perspective is needed to develop responsive strategies
   that effectively address the shifting ecological, social, cultural, and
   economic contexts of the global bycatch seascape.},

Title = {A review on the climate-induced depletion of Iran's aquifers},
Journal = {STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT},
Abstract = {Few studies have examined the impact of climate change on groundwater
   resources worldwide, especially in developing countries. The objective
   of this study is to review the effects of climate change on groundwater
   resources in Iran in order to assess the present conditions and
   challenges and future directions. To this end, the related studies,
   especially the peer-reviewed national and international articles, were
   surveyed. Only the responses of 40 aquifers have been estimated toward
   climate change in Iran, such that a large gap occurs in this
   perspective. This is in reference to the alluvial aquifers, and even
   fewer studies have evaluated the impact of climate change on hard-rock
   and karst groundwater systems despite their being highly vulnerable to
   the existing stresses. The conducted studies are primarily small-scale,
   and inadequate research has been conducted on the effect of climate
   change on aquifers at national and even regional scales. The impact of
   climate change on groundwater quality and coastal aquifers has not
   hitherto been adequately assessed. An ever-increasing temperature and
   ever-decreasing precipitation over the country have been forecasted,
   resulting in induced stresses on aquifers, including the decline of
   groundwater level, storage and recharge. If the current managerial
   approaches are maintained, the failure threshold of most aquifers will
   certainly be exceeded, making the looming crisis of water in Iran even
   worse. Finally, it is recommended to reevaluate the groundwater
   management policies across the country thoroughly and, thence, propose
   and execute the new adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Heat deficit mitigation strategies for elevated rail stations in cold
   regions of China based on thermal comfort assessment},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {228},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The elevated station of rail transit is different from the conventional
   underground stations; such buildings are complex in space form. In the
   cold region in winter, the elevated station is greatly affected by the
   outdoor climate environment, and passengers feel cold, so it is urgent
   to improve its thermal environment. In this paper, taking the Xi'an rail
   transit elevated stations in China as the research objects, the internal
   environment investigation and thermal comfort assessment of the elevated
   station were carried out by using subjective survey questionnaire
   combined with field monitoring. The thermal design temperature in
   elevated stations in winter in cold areas was determined by calculating
   change process of passengers' heat deficit rate (HDR). And then the heat
   deficit mitigation strategy of elevated stations in winter in cold areas
   was put forward, and the rationality and reliability of the strategy
   were verified Through the corresponding simulation. The field
   measurement results show that the temperature of the investigated
   stations is lower than the threshold of cold sensation, and the air flow
   rate is significant. The temperature of side station is lower than that
   of island station. The questionnaire results show that passengers who
   want to reduce the wind speed generally vote for the temperature to
   increase simulta-neously. By analysing the change of thermal deficit
   rate in the whole process of passengers entering the station, it is
   found that for two kinds of stations in the platform layer the heat
   deficit rate reaches a peak, which is-50.7 W/m2 and-53.2 W/m2,
   respectively. It is found that the appropriate temperature range to meet
   the re-quirements of thermal comfort should be 14.8 degrees C-20.8
   degrees C. The simulation results indicated that the temperature in
   platform can be raised from the current 3.6 degrees C-6.8 degrees C-11.3
   degrees C-13.6 degrees C by using the fully enclosed platform combined
   with thermal insulation system proposed. In order to reach to the
   minimum requirement of 14.8 degrees C in the station in winter, the
   station temperature can be further improved by optimizing the enclosure
   structure or installing additional air conditioning system to reach the
   comfort requirement. This study provides reliable basic data for the
   mitigation of heat deficit and developing a standard design for elevated
   stations.},

Title = {Humanity Can Still Stop Climate Change by Implementing a New
   International Climate Agreement and Applying Radical New Technology},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is a broad consensus worldwide that anthropogenic climate change
   is a scientific fact. Likewise, the fact is that the UN's efforts to
   address climate change over the last 28 years have not been successful
   enough. It is evident that the global average temperature is on the rise
   (1.1 degrees C above pre-industrial levels in 2019). A particular
   concern comes from the fact that the Paris Agreement on keeping
   increases in the global average temperature to below +2 degrees C is an
   unenforceable ambition, since the focus is more on consequences than
   causes. In addition, economic policies regarding global taxes, as well
   as adaptation and mitigation measures, are questionable, as there is no
   evidence that changes in the climate system will proceed at the same
   rate in the coming years. This paper proposes an engineering approach
   that considers all relevant aspects of the climate change problem and
   proposes a new policy, named the ``Climate New Deal{''}. It deals with:
   (i) Reorientation from a high-carbon economy to a green economy; (ii)
   The intensive use of radically new technology, e.g., ``Seawater Steam
   Engine{''} technology for the simultaneous production of thermal and
   electric energy and drinking water; and (iii) The intensive use of
   energy efficient technologies and RES technologies, especially in
   transport.},

Title = {Incorporating uncertainty and risk into decision making to reduce
   nitrogen inputs to impaired waters},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {249},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {This article aims to understand decision making under uncertainty and
   risk, with a case study on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Decision makers need
   to consider imperfect information on the cost and effectiveness of
   advanced nitrogen-removing on-site wastewater treatment systems as
   options to mitigate water quality degradation. Research included
   modeling nitrogen load reduction to impaired coastal waters from seven
   treatment system technologies and eliciting expert knowledge on their
   costs. Predictions of nitrogen load removal and cost for each technology
   incorporated variation in effectiveness and uncertainty in household
   water use, costs, and expert confidence in costs. The predictions were
   evaluated using the Pareto efficiency concept to reveal tradeoffs
   between cost and effectiveness. The stochastic dominance index was used
   to identify preferred technologies for risk-averse decision making,
   assuming no further learning is possible. Lastly, the predictions were
   combined into a cost-effectiveness metric to estimate the expected
   payoff of implementing the best treatment system in the face of
   uncertainty and the expected payoff of learning which treatment systems
   are most cost-effective over time. The expected value of perfect
   information was calculated as the difference between the expected
   payoffs. Three technologies revealed Pareto efficient tradeoffs between
   cost and effectiveness, whereas one technology was the preferred
   risk-averse option in the absence of future learning. There was a high
   expected value of perfect information, which could motivate adaptive
   management on Cape Cod. This research demonstrated decision analysis
   methods to guide future research and decision making toward meeting
   water quality objectives and reducing uncertainty.},

Title = {Small islands, valuable insights: systems of customary resource use and
   resilience to climate change in the Pacific},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Understanding how social-ecological systems are and can be resilient to
   climate change is one of the world's most crucial problems today. It
   requires knowledge at local and global scales, the integration of
   natural and social sciences, and a focus on biocultural diversity. Small
   Pacific Islands and the knowledge-practice-belief systems of their
   peoples have a long history of resilience to environmental variability
   and unpredictability, including in areas with marginal habitats and with
   periodic, severe disturbance (e.g., drought, flood, storms, and
   tsunami). We review the state of research on these knowledge systems as
   it pertains to resilience and adaptation, and we highlight critical
   research needs to address the interrelated areas of: (1) local-scale
   expertise and observations of change with regard to weather,
   life-history cycles, and ecological processes; (2) customary resource
   management institutions and practices (i.e., with agroforests and the
   nearshore marine environment); and (3) the roles of leaders, social
   institutions, and social networks in the context of disturbance and
   change. We conclude that these knowledge systems can contribute
   high-resolution observations, benchmark data, and insights into
   practices that enhance resilience and adaptive capacity in integrated
   terrestrial and marine systems. Community-based and participatory
   approaches can complement and ground-truth climate models and direct
   culturally appropriate resource management, research, and adaptation
   measures. Although most islands in the Pacific are small, their
   knowledge systems include valuable insights on seasonal cycles,
   ecological processes, and the management of biocultural diversity that
   are relevant at a broad scale for understanding resilience and
   adaptability to the social-ecological effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {The research aims (1) knowing the adaptation ability of coastal peoples
   in Kalama Island, Tatoareng District Sangihe Island Regency to climate
   change that occurs; (2) analyze the impact caused by climate change on
   the fisheries sector in Kalama Island, Tatoareng District Sangihe Island
   Regency, and (3) adaptation strategies undertaken by coastal peoples,
   especially for fishermen in Kalama Island in the face of climate change.
   The research method applied is a qualitative descriptive survey method.
   This research was conducted in Kalama Island where the population in
   Tatoareng district that located in Kalama Island was 200 families with
   reference to the research variables namely: people adaptation and
   climate change. Furthermore, data collection techniques are carried out
   by observation, questionnaire and documentation. While the data analysis
   technique is carried out qualitatively by recapitulating the answers,
   compiling the respondent's presentation table, the description and
   interpretation of the data that has been tabulated and then concluding
   the results of the research data. The results showed that coastal
   communities in the island of Tatoareng who are generally fishermen felt
   that climate change was happening lately, indicated by the answer that
   most of the coastal communities as a whole were still unable to develop
   strategies to adapt to climate or weather changes such as wind, bulk
   rain and waves. Information that received by the community is still very
   lacking with the condition of the remote island, so they have very
   little information in real time from printed or electronic media.
   Physically, Kalama Island experienced several problems such as the
   presence of coastal abrasion due to the coastal conditions that have
   experienced physical degradation along the coast of Kalama Island.},

Title = {Integrating Teaching and Learning with Inter-Disciplinary Action
   Research in Support of Climate Resilient Urban Development},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The capital cities of the South Pacific are experiencing rapid
   urbanisation pressures as increasing numbers of people migrate to the
   primary cities either in search of employment and greater access to
   healthcare and education, or as a consequence of environmental `push'
   factors. However, the limited capacity of municipal Governments to
   respond to the scale and pace of change is leading to a growth of
   informal settlements in peri-urban locations. Factors of exposure,
   sensitivity, and adaptive capacity combine to make these informal
   settlements the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards. In response to
   this critical urban resilience agenda, this paper looks at how
   participatory action research is providing inter-disciplinary scientific
   support for the implementation of urban resilience and climate actions
   in Honiara, Solomon Islands. Adaptation measures involve a combination
   of hard and soft actions; as well as activities designed to strengthen
   local capacity to respond to contemporary resilience challenges.
   Addressing the adaptive capacity component, this paper also highlights
   the opportunities for Australian universities to integrate teaching and
   learning with action research to achieve a substantive real-world impact
   in the Pacific region, as well as illustrating the capacity
   strengthening benefits that can be achieved through sustained engagement
   and collaborative partnerships with local organisations.},

Title = {Social dilemmas, policy instruments, and climate adaptation measures:
   the case of green roofs},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Green roofs contribute to both climate change adaptation and mitigation.
   Promoting green roofs is thus a key element in urban strategies to
   address climate change. How to actually promote green roofs, however,
   has so far proven elusive: attempts to link specific policy instruments
   to a more or less successful diffusion of green roofs have been few and
   far between. The present paper relies on institutional economics to
   advance the present understanding of the link between policy instruments
   and green roofs. It argues that different green roofs are confronted
   with different social dilemmas, and thus require different policy
   instruments. Specifically, small green roofs face a free-rider problem,
   which is best addressed through regulations and incentives. Large green
   roofs face instead a collective action problem, which is best addressed
   through communications and network-building. This perspective is tested
   empirically through a comparative analysis of 18 global cities on the
   forefront in the promotion of green roofs. The policy instruments
   observed in these cities match with the theoretical expectations laid
   down in the paper. Implications emerge for both policy and research.},

Title = {Implementation of Nature-Based Solutions for Hydro-Meteorological Risk
   Reduction in Small Mediterranean Catchments: The Case of Portofino
   Natural Regional Park, Italy},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) are usually defined as complementary or
   alternative solutions to ``grey infrastructures{''} (traditionally made
   with cement) aimed at conserving and regenerating the functionality of
   natural and semi-natural ecosystems. The research to date shows a
   considerable potential of NBS to address the current challenges related
   to climate change and geo-hydrological risks. Despite significant
   interest in NBS by researchers and practitioners, knowledge concerning
   their practical implementation, monitoring, and evaluation is still
   lacking. This is particularly true for large-scale NBS. The present
   paper discusses how such solutions can be implemented in the context of
   hydro-meteorological risk reduction in small Mediterranean catchments
   with a strong tourist vocation. The work presented here is situated
   within the RECONECT Project (Regenerating ECOsystems with Nature-based
   solutions for hydro-meteorological risk rEduCTion), which aims to
   contribute to a European reference framework on NBS by demonstrating,
   upscaling, and replicating large-scale NBS in rural and natural areas.
   The Italian case study of RECONECT is the Portofino Natural Regional
   Park, which represents a unique natural landscape element with high
   ecologic, social, and economic (touristic) value, which is threatened by
   a range of geo-hydrological hazards, such as flash floods,
   hyper-concentrated floods, shallow landslides, rockfalls, and storm
   surges. This paper also presents details of NBS interventions in two
   pilot catchments (San Fruttuoso and Paraggi) visited by thousands of
   tourists throughout the year. It addresses some of the key aspects
   related to monitoring meteorological and hydrological processes, as well
   as remote sensing activities (i.e., LiDAR surveys), which are necessary
   for the identification of critical-instability areas along waterways and
   the reconstruction of dry stone walls. Lastly, a discussion of relevant
   mitigation and adaptation strategies that are potentially replicable at
   national and international levels is also provided.},

Title = {Geophysical investigation for seawater intrusion in the high-quality
   coastal aquifers of India: a review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Around the globe, seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer is a
   significant problem. Excessive groundwater extraction because of
   population growth, industrialization, tourism, and other anthropogenic
   activities and geogenic processes initiates and accelerates this
   problem. The contaminated groundwater impacts the health, economic
   activities, and social and cultural development of coastal regions. This
   work aims to explore the current status and a holistic comprehending
   review of geophysical studies applied to delineate the seawater
   intrusion in the high-quality coastal aquifers in India, as well as its
   origin and causes, mitigation strategies, and recent advancements in
   geophysical techniques to access the qualitative and quantitative
   properties of the complex aquifer system. In the future, it is
   recommended to do a detailed subsurface imaging of the entire coastal
   belt of India to decipher the lateral and vertical variation of the
   lithological conditions and seawater intrusion in space and time with
   improved/advanced geophysical techniques, which can lead toward
   sustainable development.},

Title = {Scopes of community participation in development for adaptation:
   Experiences from the Haor region of Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {51},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the disaster-context, adaptation is considered as the process of
   changing status with effective strategies for reducing disaster risks
   and enhancing resilience. Planning approaches for adaptation often
   merges with socioeconomic development, applying a top-down, technocratic
   rational paradigm. Whereas the bottom-up process of planning encourages
   communities to participate for sharing the power of decision making,
   incorporating its knowledge, ideas, and concerns. Particularly in
   developing countries, non-governmental organization (NGO)s,
   collaborating with communities and governmental organizations, conduct
   community development projects. The community reactions towards these
   projects and condition of community participation in their planning
   process are needed to be evaluated to develop a better understanding
   about the scope of community participation in the local level
   development activities for reducing future risks.
   This case study based research, employing qualitative tools, studies two
   settlements in the Haor region of Bangladesh to investigate NGO-driven
   development projects and their planning process through the lens of
   community participation. The region is a vast tectonic depression where
   its inhabitants live with significant seasonal flood risks,
   accommodating themselves on constructed islands.
   The empirical evidences are evaluated to identify levels of community
   participation and it has been found as ritualistic in most of the cases,
   where the community concerns and demands are ignored through convincing
   them, manipulating their ideas and providing therapies. It also does not
   often allow to empower the community to take control over the project,
   which is considered as necessary in a disaster context to coincide
   adaptation with development, aiming to enhance community resilience.},

Title = {Modelling the Impact of Climate Change on Coastal Flooding: Implications
   for Coastal Structures Design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the present work, the impact of climate change on coastal flooding is
   investigated through a set of interoperable models developed by the
   authors, following a modular modelling approach and adapting the
   modelling sequence to two separate objectives with respect to inundation
   over large-scale areas and coastal protection structures' design. The
   modelling toolbox used includes a large-scale wave propagation model, a
   storm-induced circulation model, and an advanced nearshore wave
   propagation model based on the higher order Boussinesq-type equations,
   all of which are presented in detail. Model capabilities are validated
   and applications are made for projected scenarios of climate
   change-induced wave and storm surge events, simulating coastal flooding
   over the low-lying areas of a semi-enclosed bay and testing the effects
   of different structures on a typical sandy beach (both in northern
   Greece). This work is among the few in relevant literature that
   incorporate a fully non-linear wave model to a modelling system aimed at
   representing coastal flooding. Results highlight the capabilities of the
   presented modelling approach and set the basis for a comprehensive
   evaluation of the use of advanced modelling tools for the design of
   coastal protection and adaptation measures against future climatic
   pressures.},

Title = {Comparative assessment of various heat island mitigation measures},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {162-170},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With the rapid intensification of urban heat islands worldwide, measures
   for its mitigation are gaining attention. Some of the most popular
   measures are based on employing evaporative cooling, altering the
   surfaces' albedo or making use of shading. In this paper, we numerically
   investigate the influence of each of these three methods on the comfort
   of a pedestrian in a typical urban street canyon. The environmental
   conditions in the urban street canyon are obtained from a detailed
   microclimatic model, and serve as input for a comfort model based on the
   Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Simulations are conducted for
   average summer conditions, taken from a typical meteorological year
   (TMY), and for heat wave (HW) conditions. The results show that
   evaporative cooling can considerably reduce the air temperature and the
   mean radiant temperature, but that the corresponding increase in vapor
   pressure limits the net gain in comfort. Shading results in
   significantly reduced surface temperatures, in addition to decreasing
   the intensity of direct solar irradiation, both leading to an increased
   comfort sensation. Increasing the local albedo of urban surfaces also
   leads to lower surface temperatures, but does not affect the amount of
   direct solar irradiation, explaining the lower comfort gain compared to
   shading. The cooling effect of all methods proved to increase during a
   HW in comparison to a TMY. These observations show that the
   effectiveness of mitigation measures highly depends on the climatic
   conditions and demonstrate the potential of microclimatic models to
   determine the optimal combination of measures for a given context. (C)

Title = {Insight into the genome and brackish water adaptation strategies of
   toxic and bloom-forming Baltic Sea Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The Baltic Sea is a shallow basin of brackish water in which the spatial
   salinity gradient is one of the most important factors contributing to
   species distribution. The Baltic Sea is infamous for its annual
   cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Nodularia spumigena, Aphanizomenon
   spp., and Dolichospermum spp. that cause harm, especially for
   recreational users. To broaden our knowledge of the cyanobacterial
   adaptation strategies for brackish water environments, we sequenced the
   entire genome of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, a species occurring not
   only in freshwater environments but also in brackish water. Comparative
   genomics analyses revealed a close association with Dolichospermum sp.
   UHCC 0090 isolated from a lake in Finland. The genome closure of
   Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315 unraveled a mixture of two subtypes in the
   original culture, and subtypes exhibited distinct buoyancy phenotypes.
   Salinity less than 3 g L-1 NaCl enabled proper growth of Dolichospermum
   sp. UHCC 0315, whereas growth was arrested at moderate salinity (6 g L-1
   NaCl). The concentrations of toxins, microcystins, increased at moderate
   salinity, whereas RNA sequencing data implied that Dolichospermum
   remodeled its primary metabolism in unfavorable high salinity. Based on
   our results, the predicted salinity decrease in the Baltic Sea may favor
   toxic blooms of Dolichospermum spp.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {292-299},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study carried out in late 2013 for the French Ministry of Ecology,
   Sustainable Development and Energy (MEDDE), aims primarily to make a
   situational analysis of the awareness and consideration level of the UHI
   constraints, by organizations that influence on the location and the
   design of building hosting sensitive people to high temperature
   (nursery, retirement homes). This assessment was performed by a national
   survey which was conducted in 10 French cities which are likely to be
   affected by the phenomenon of UHI, among 75 local stakeholders who were
   likely to be involved in the choice of construction or location of this
   kind of establishment. The UHI mitigation and adaptation practices
   applied in each city have also been analyzed. These practices are mainly
   vegetation (green spaces, green screens and roofs) and specific coatings
   on facades and roofs (variation of radiative properties by using
   different colors and materials). Among the other main conclusions of
   this investigation, it appears that only 11\% of the total panel
   questioned considers UHI in decisions and only 17\% of the influential
   stakeholders believe that there has been an evolution in their decision
   making since the introduction of the PNACC plan in France. These most
   influential stakeholders in the decision-making process are the
   designers (prime contracting: thermal and design engineering, architect,
   etc.). To complete this study, some operational suggestions are proposed
   to improve the consideration of UHI constraints in decision process,
   concerning the implementation or the refurbishment of the targeted
   building. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Impacts of ocean acidification in a warming Mediterranean Sea: An
   overview},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mediterranean Sea fisheries supply significant local and international
   markets, based largely on small pelagic fish, artisanal fisheries and
   aquaculture of finfish (mainly seabass and seabream) and shellfish
   (mussels and oysters). Fisheries and aquaculture contribute to the
   economy of countries bordering this sea and provide food and employment
   to coastal communities employing ca 600,000 people. Increasing
   temperatures and heat wave frequency are causing stress and mortality in
   marine organisms and ocean acidification is expected to worsen these
   effects, especially for bivalves and coralligenous systems. Recruitment
   and seed production present possible bottlenecks for shellfish
   aquaculture in the future since early life stages are vulnerable to
   acidification and warming. Although adult finfish seem able to withstand
   the projected increases in seawater CO2, degradation of seabed habitats
   and increases in harmful blooms of algae and jellyfish might adversely
   affect fish stocks. Ocean acidification should therefore be factored
   into fisheries and aquaculture management plans. Rising CO2 levels are
   expected to reduce coastal biodiversity, altering ecosystem functioning
   and possibly impacting tourism being the Mediterranean the world's most
   visited region. We recommend that ocean acidification is monitored in
   key areas of the Mediterranean Sea, with regular assessments of the
   likely socio-economic impacts to build adaptive strategies for the
   Mediterranean countries concerned. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The management of freshwater stored in coastal aquifers involves
   decisions regarding not only the sustainable utilization and exploration
   of optimal coastal groundwater resources but also the designing of
   optimal strategies for controlling seawater intrusion (SI).
   Simultaneously optimizing pumping operation, the extent of SI, and
   design of mitigation measures is a challenging task because mitigating
   SI has become imperative for groundwater management of coastal aquifers.
   This study proposed a simulation-optimization framework (SWT-NPTSGA) to
   search Pareto-optimal solutions for estimating the optimal pumping and
   artificial recharge schemes under complicated SI constraints. The
   SWT-NPTSGA is based on a combination of a new hybrid multi-objective
   evolutionary algorithm, the niched Pareto tabu search combined with a
   genetic algorithm, and the numerical variable-density groundwater flow
   and transport model. Three different management scenarios, pumping only,
   injection only, and combined pumping and injection (P\&I), were designed
   in a synthetic application to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed
   methodology. The results showed that the P\&I scenario could generate
   comprehensive information for multi-objective decision-making. The SI
   mitigation measures by artificial recharge could offer the most
   groundwater supply and the least area of seawater intrusion. The
   optimization results showed the potential feasibility of the proposed
   methodology for managing groundwater resources and controlling SI in
   coastal aquifers.},

Abstract = {A major challenge in modern biology is to understand extinction risk
   from climate change across all realms. Recent research has revealed that
   physiological tolerance, behavioral thermoregulation, and small
   elevation shifts are dominant coping strategies on land, whereas
   large-scale latitudinal shifts are more important in the ocean.
   Freshwater taxa may face the highest global extinction risks.
   Nevertheless, some species in each realm face similar risks because of
   shared adaptive, dispersal, or physiological tolerances and abilities.
   Taking a cross-realm perspective offers unique research opportunities
   because confounding physical factors in one realm are often
   disaggregated in another realm. Cross-realm, across taxa, and other
   forms of climate change biology synthesis are needed to advance our
   understanding of emergent patterns of risk across all life.},

Abstract = {The US Country Studies Program (US CSP) is parr of the United States'
   contribution to the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
   Change (UNFCCC) by providing financial and technical support to
   developing and economically transitional countries to carry out their
   country studies in order to address issues on climate change The Country
   Studies results will be the scientific and technical bases for planning
   their climate change national action plans which will be implemented for
   future national communications and will eventually be required by the
   UNFCCC. Among the 56 countries supported by the US CSP there are strong
   oceanic and coastal vulnerability and adaptation projects in 41 country
   studies For the eight small island nations in the program, integrated
   coastal management (ICM) is the recommended adaptation strategy as the
   essential part of their climate change national action plans. This paper
   reviews the difficulties and challenges facing small island starts as
   they attempt to address climate change impacts on their environments,
   cultures, societies and economics. The paper draws on presentations and

   Management Scenarios},

Abstract = {Land management in coastal areas has to cope with impacts of climate
   change and sea level rise. In Germany, landscape plans assess and
   organize the spatial allocation of land use as an environmental
   contribution to general spatial planning. Collaborative planning
   processes are important to develop sustainable and ecosystem-based
   strategies to make coastal landscapes climate proof. However, there is
   little experience with collaborative processes in practical planning in
   Germany, and probably in other countries as well. This paper conducts an
   empirical case study in the low-lying coastal areas of northwest
   Germany. During a collaborative landscape planning process, four
   different ecosystem-based land management scenarios have been
   co-designed by regional experts and researchers. The participatory and
   iterative process included the development of scenario narratives to
   define planning goals, the use of land use elements and their relations
   to ecosystem services as planning entities in terms of indicators, the
   art-based illustrations of the different scenarios, and an evaluation
   and monitoring of the outcomes by regional experts. The decision-maker
   group decided on the so-called ``actor-based{''} scenario, which
   contained freshwater retention areas (polders) to prevent potential
   uncontrolled flooding of the hinterland. This climate adaptation
   strategy has been implemented in the regional development plan of the
   county.},

Abstract = {This research investigates how land use changes due to sea level rise
   (SLR) may affect traffic network congestion and how preventive
   protection measures against SLR can significantly improve transportation
   network performance and possibly be cost effective. We use the San
   Francisco Bay Area shoreline, under a one-meter SLR, as a case study,
   and evaluate the results with different metrics: the number of commuters
   that are not able to execute their trip, and the Vehicle Hours Traveled
   increase. Our model considers both hydrodynamic and traffic effects. The
   results show that the relocation of commercial and residential buildings
   from inundated to dry areas will increase congestion levels, while
   preventive protection of the shoreline leads to lower levels of traffic
   congestion. Finally, we discuss other possible costs related to the
   absence of levee protection that should be evaluated by policy makers
   before developing SLR adaptation strategies.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Climate change affects milk yield, which may have a profound impact on
   the dairy industry. Taking Fonterra as an example, this study analyses
   the climate data of 99 consecutive months from June 2012 to August 2020
   and the corresponding monthly milk yield data of North Island and South
   Island. The results show that the monthly milk yield correlates with the
   monthly mean temperature, the monthly extreme maximum temperature, the
   monthly extreme minimum temperature, the monthly mean relative humidity,
   and the monthly mean temperature and humidity index (THI). In addition,
   with the increase of annual mean temperature in New Zealand, the annual
   milk yield of North Island decreases with the increase of temperature.
   Fonterra needs to take measures to mitigate the negative impact of
   climate warming on milk yield. However, in the recent nine years, South
   Island's annual milk yield increases with annual mean temperature.
   Furthermore, regression equations with climate factors as independent
   variables and monthly milk yield as dependent variables are established
   for North Island and South Island. In North Island, the monthly milk
   yield changed periodically with time. The findings of the study show
   that the annual milk yield will decrease with the increase of
   temperature due to global warming in North Island. However, South Island
   needs to deal with the negative impact of high temperature on milk yield
   in summer. Therefore, Fonterra needs to take immediate measures to deal
   with the negative impact of climate change.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {364},
Pages = {227-233},
Abstract = {Intentional ocean fertilization and the commercial sale of associated
   carbon offsets raise a number of issues in international law. On the one
   hand, states are obliged to adopt adaptation and mitigation measures to
   prevent dangerous climate change. On the other hand, international law
   obliges states to protect and preserve the marine environment and to act
   in a precautionary manner in the face of scientific uncertainty. In this
   article, we examine the application of the international Law of the Sea
   to ocean fertilization, with particular reference to the law's dumping
   regime, which prohibits the dumping of wastes or other materials from
   vessels into the ocean. We then examine the application of the
   international legal regime on climate change to ocean fertilization and
   assess the international legal basis for the sale of carbon offsets or
   carbon credits associated with ocean fertilization. We conclude that
   ocean fertilization is governed by the dumping regime and that its
   commercialization is inconsistent with international law unless and
   until independent, internationally peer-reviewed scientific research and
   assessment demonstrates that it is effective and that its benefits
   outweigh the risks to the marine environment.},

Title = {A framework to include the (inter)dependencies of Disaster Risk
   Reduction measures in coastal risk assessment},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Effective coastal risk management often involves the selection and
   appraisal of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures. Such measures,
   however, are rarely implemented in isolation and their
   (inter)dependencies need to be considered to assess the overall
   contribution to risk reduction. This paper presents a framework that
   utilises a pathway-based approach to consider such (inter)dependencies.
   The framework identifies measures that have the potential to directly
   influence risk reduction (primary measures) at the individual/household
   level and how these relate to the implementation of other measures
   (non-primary). These two types of measures are linked using intermediate
   pathway factors, which aggregate to the effective uptake and/or
   operation of primary measure(s) and subsequently represent the direct
   influence on risk reduction when included in a risk assessment.
   The approach is demonstrated utilising two coastal risk examples. The
   case of Varna Bay, Bulgaria highlights a pathway, which explores how
   developing a coastal Early Warning System (EWS), can enable assets to be
   moved and saved prior to an event. The Praia de Faro, Portuguese
   application provides an example of how local risk awareness meetings can
   support the uptake of property raising to protect against erosion. Past
   experience, poor trust in authorities, house type/feasibility, transient
   population and strong community networks are identified as key
   influencing variables across both cases.
   The process of considering the (inter)dependencies between measures has
   potential to lead to improved decision making and strategy building. The
   framework developed is flexible in nature and can be applied in many
   different situations; however, it is one step towards accounting for
   these (inter)dependencies at the individual/household level. Ex-ante or
   ex-post survey data, expert judgement and literature have been used to
   estimate these factors. However, in many cases this good quality data is
   not available, and is something that national level monitoring
   strategies, along with the research community, must address.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change: Social-ecological resilience in a Canadian
   Western Arctic community},
Journal = {CONSERVATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Human adaptation remains an insufficiently studied part of the subject
   of climate change. This paper examines the questions of adaptation and
   change in terms of social-ecological resilience using lessons from a
   place-specific case study. The Inuvialuit people of the small community
   of Sachs Harbour in Canada's western Arctic have been tracking climate
   change throughout the 1990s. We analyze the adaptive capacity of this
   community to deal with climate change. Short-term responses to changes
   in land-based activities, which are identified as coping mechanisms, are
   one component of this adaptive capacity. The second component is related
   to cultural and ecological adaptations of the Inuvialuit for life in a
   highly variable and uncertain environment; these represent long-term
   adaptive strategies. These two types of strategies are, in fact, on a
   continuum in space and time. This study suggests new ways in which
   theory and practice can be combined by showing how societies may adapt
   to climate change at multiple scales. Switching species and adjusting
   the ``where, when, and how{''} of hunting are examples of shorter-term
   responses. On the other hand, adaptations such as flexibility in
   seasonal hunting patterns, traditional knowledge that allows the
   community to diversity hunting activities, networks for sharing food and
   other resources, and intercommunity trade are longer-term, culturally
   ingrained mechanisms. Individuals, households, and the community as a
   whole also provide feedback on their responses to change. Newly
   developing co-management institutions create additional linkages for
   feedback across different levels, enhancing the capacity for learning
   and self-organization of the local inhabitants and making it possible
   for them to transmit community concerns to regional, national, and
   international levels.},

Title = {Environmental impacts of reflective materials: Is high albedo a `silver
   bullet' for mitigating urban heat island?},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {47},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Studies on urban heat island (UHI) have been more than a century after
   the phenomenon was first discovered in the early 1800s. UHI emerges as
   the source of many urban environmental problems and exacerbates the
   living environment in cities. Under the challenges of increasing
   urbanization and future climate changes, there is a pressing need for
   sustainable adaptation/mitigation strategies for UHI effects, one
   popular option being the use of reflective materials. While it is
   introduced as an effective method to reduce temperature and energy
   consumption in cities, its impacts on environmental sustainability and
   large-scale non-local effect are inadequately explored. This paper
   provides a synthetic overview of potential environmental impacts of
   reflective materials at a variety of scales, ranging from energy load on
   a single building to regional hydroclimate. The review shows that
   mitigation potential of reflective materials depends on a set of
   factors, including building characteristics, urban environment,
   meteorological and geographical conditions, to name a few. Precaution
   needs to be exercised by city planners and policy makers for large-scale
   deployment of reflective materials before their environmental impacts,
   especially on regional hydroclimates, are better understood. In general,
   it is recommended that optimal strategy for UHI needs to be determined
   on a city-by-city basis, rather than adopting a
   ``one-solution-fits-all{''} strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {How good is good? Human values and Europe's proposed Marine Strategy
   Directive},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {56},

Pages = {187-204},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The adoption of the proposed European Marine Strategy Directive is an
   opportunity for a comprehensive policy for protecting, improving and
   sustainably using Europe's environmentally degraded seas. It calls for
   an ecosystem-based approach to management where humans are regarded as a
   key system component. Although the proposed wording has been the subject
   of fierce debate, the central policy goal remains achieving ``Good
   Environmental Status{''}. The interpretation of ``good{''} is key to
   implementation and relates to human values and worldviews. We
   demonstrate how these vary widely across Europe. Solution of fundamental
   considerations such as the assignation of reference states, the balance
   between precautionary and evidence-based action, the degree of
   subsidiarity, and conservation strategies including marine protected
   areas, will ultimately depend upon public understanding, involvement in
   and support for the Directive. The social element, critical to effective
   adaptive management, requires greater attention within the context of a
   regional seas geographical framework. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts can be especially large in cities(1,2). Several
   large cities are taking climate change into account in long-term
   strategies(3,4), for which it is important to have information on the
   costs and benefits of adaptation(5). Studies on climate change impacts
   in cities mostly focus on a limited set of countries and risks, for
   example sea-level rise, health and water resources(6). Most of these
   studies are qualitative, except for the costs of sea-level rise in
   cities(7,8). These impact estimates do not take into account that large
   cities will experience additional warming due to the urban heat island
   effect(9,10), that is, the change of local climate patterns caused by
   urbanization. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the economic
   costs of the joint impacts of local and global climate change for all
   main cities around the world. Cost-benefit analyses are presented of
   urban heat island mitigation options, including green and cool roofs and
   cool pavements. It is shown that local actions can be a climate
   risk-reduction instrument. Furthermore, limiting the urban heat island
   through city adaptation plans can significantly amplify the benefits of
   international mitigation efforts.},

   of Macau with Proposed Ameliorative Strategies},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change has resulted in more extreme weather events in coastal
   cities, and understanding how daily life is impacted is crucial to make
   effective adaptation measures. Using Macau as a testbed, this research
   describes examines the impacts of flooding caused by storm surges on
   residents' daily travel and proposes measures to ameliorate disaster
   risks. Spatial extents of urban floods were modelled through inundation
   simulations using geographical information data. An analysis of the
   travel distance increases from residents' homes to common types of
   destinations was performed both under normal conditions and during flood
   events in GIS (Geographic Information System) to assess the influence of
   urban flooding on residents' daily travel. The results show that one
   third of the land is threatened by floods in Macau. People's average
   travel distance increases as the warning levels escalate, and travel
   distance is predicted to rise by up to 64.5\%. Based on the findings,
   the study proposes mitigation strategies to minimize urban flooding's
   impacts. It suggests that the area more densely populated is not
   necessarily the one requiring the deployment of preventative measures
   with the highest priority, as a traffic analysis is identified as the
   key area which demands disaster prevention measures.},

Abstract = {Storm surge barriers, levees, and other coastal flood defense
   megaprojects are currently being proposed as strategies to protect
   several US cities against coastal storms and rising sea levels. However,
   social conflict and other political factors add a layer of complexity
   that casts doubt on their status as practical climate adaptation
   options. The specific mechanisms responsible for some projects not
   progressing beyond initial planning stages remains unclear. In this
   study, we examined the outcome of two USACE storm surge barrier
   proposals to explore the political reasons why some coastal flood
   protection megaprojects break ground in the US, while others do not.
   Using original archive research, we concluded that storm surge barriers
   are politically challenging climate adaptation options because of modern
   environmental laws that provide avenues for expression of oppositional
   views within the decision process and the allure of alternative options
   that are more aesthetically pleasing and cheaper and faster to
   implement. To better allocate public resources and utilize the expertise
   of USACE, future flood protection megaprojects should first achieve
   broad support from the public, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and
   elected officials before beginning serious planning. This support could
   be achieved through new innovative designs that simultaneously address
   adverse environmental impacts and provide cobenefits (e.g., recreation).
   New designs should be studied to better understand the level of
   protection offered and their associated reliability so that USACE has
   confidence in their use.},

Journal = {WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2331-2339},
Abstract = {Decentralised water supply systems are becoming increasingly affordable
   and commonplace in Australia and have the potential to alleviate urban
   water shortages and reduce pollution into natural receiving marine and
   freshwater streams. Learning processes are necessary to support the
   efficient implementation of decentralised systems. These processes
   reveal the complex socio-technical and institutional factors to be
   considered when developing an enabling environment supporting
   decentralised water and wastewater servicing solutions. Critical to the
   technological transition towards established decentralised systems is
   the ability to create strategic and adaptive capacity to promote
   learning and dialogue. Learning processes require institutional
   mechanisms to ensure the lessons are incorporated into the formulation
   of policy and regulation, through constructive involvement of key
   government institutions. Engagement of stakeholders is essential to the
   enabling environment. Collaborative learning environments using systems
   analysis with communities (social learning) and adaptive management
   techniques are useful in refining and applying scientists' and managers'
   knowledge (knowledge management).},

Abstract = {This article explores the drivers, benefits, and challenges to climate
   change adaptation in Bangladesh. It specifically investigates the
   ``Community Based Adaptation to Climate Change through Coastal
   Afforestation Program,{''} a 5-year \$5 million adaptation scheme being
   funded and implemented in part by the Government of Bangladesh, United
   Nations Development Program, and Global Environment Facility. The
   article explores how the CBACC-CA builds various types of adaptive
   capacity in Bangladesh and the extent its design and implementation
   offers lessons for other adaptation programs around the world. The first
   part of the study begins by describing its research methods consisting
   of research interviews, site visits, and a literature review. It then
   summarizes six primary sectors vulnerable to climate change in
   Bangladesh: water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human
   settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity,
   fisheries, and human health. The article next describes the genesis and
   background behind the CBACC-CA, with an emphasis on components that
   promote capacity development, demonstration projects, risk reduction,
   and knowledge management. The article concludes that technology by
   itself is only a partial component of successful adaptation efforts, and
   that multiple and integrated adaptation measures that cut across sectors
   and social, institutional, and infrastructural dimensions are needed to
   truly build resilience and effectiveness.},

Title = {The efficiency of phenological shifts as an adaptive response against
   climate change: a case study of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta)

Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Phenological shifts are widely reported for different species as a
   response to climate change. Still, the efficiency of this mechanism is
   questioned because of the accelerated rate of change and the different
   change patterns of various climate parameters that may cause mismatches.
   Here, using loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) as model species,
   we examined whether phenological shifts could be an effective adaptive
   strategy over the critical period that determines reproductive output in
   the Mediterranean region. We compared the rate of temperature and
   precipitation change over the recent past (1971-2015) and future periods
   (2016-2060) along the 45 main nesting sites of the Mediterranean
   population, during the incubation period. Next, utilizing predictions of
   an earlier nesting season, we evaluated whether the timing of incubation
   will impact offspring survival on the Mediterranean population. To
   further assess species vulnerability, we investigated any potential
   relationship between hatching success and climate parameters at the
   largest Mediterranean nesting rookery (Zakynthos, Greece). We found that
   phenological changes would allow species to capture a thermal window
   similar to one they experience nowadays during the incubation period.
   Still, phenological shifts might be less adequate to follow
   precipitation changes, which however, were found to have a limited
   impact upon hatching success. Global adaptation management strategies
   should be directed towards (a) acquisition of long-term high-resolution
   temperature and precipitation series at nesting sites, (b) developing
   early warning systems to prevent negative impacts upon reproductive
   outputs, and (c) directly applying cooling of the nests when first
   altered climate signs are detected.},

Title = {Tissue-Specific Transcriptomes Outline Halophyte Adaptive Strategies in
   the Gray Mangrove (Avicennia marina)},

Abstract = {Avicennia marina forests fulfill essential blue carbon and ecosystem
   services, including halting coastal erosion and supporting fisheries.
   Genetic studies of A. marina tissues could yield insight into halophyte
   adaptive strategies, empowering saline agriculture research. We compare
   transcriptomes from A. marina pneumatophores, stems, leaves, flowers,
   seeds, and transcriptomes across four widely divergent environments in
   the Indo-Pacific (Red Sea, Arabian Gulf, Bay of Bengal, and Red River
   Delta) to decipher the shared and location-, tissue-, and
   condition-specific functions. On average, 4.8\% of transcripts per
   tissue were uniquely expressed in that tissue, and 12.2\% were shared in
   all five tissues. Flowers' transcript expression was the most distinct,
   with domain-centric gene ontology analysis showing high enrichment for
   stimulus-responsive processes, as well as genes implicated in flowering
   (hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase, TPM = 3687) and floral scent
   biosynthesis (e.g., benzoyl\_coenzyme\_A, 2497.2 TPM). Pneumatophores
   highly expressed antioxidant genes, such as glutathione S-transferase
   (GST, TPM = 4759) and thioredoxin (TRX, TPM = 936.2), as well as
   proteins in the GO term `Hydroquinone:oxygen oxidoreductase activity'
   (enrichment Z = 7.69, FDR-corr. p = 0.000785). Tissue-specific metabolic
   pathway reconstruction revealed unique processes in the five tissues;
   for example, seeds showed the most complete expression of lipid
   biosynthetic and degradation pathways. The leaf transcriptome had the
   lowest functional diversity among the expressed genes in any tissue, but
   highly expressed a catalase (TPM = 4181) and was enriched for the GO
   term `transmembrane transporter activity' (GO:0015238; Z = 11.83;
   FDR-corr. p = 1.58 x 10(-9)), underscoring the genes for salt exporters.
   Metallothioneins (MTs) were the highest-expressed genes in all tissues
   from the cultivars of all locations; the dominant expression of these
   metal-binding and oxidative-stress control genes indicates they are
   essential for A. marina in its natural habitats. Our study yields
   insight into how A. marina tissue-specific gene expression supports
   halotolerance and other coastal adaptative strategies in this halophytic
   angiosperm.},

Abstract = {We conducted a bibliometric analysis of research in or about South
   African National Parks, published between 2003 and 2013. Our goal was to
   identify the major research topics, and to examine the role of in-house
   ({''}embedded{''}) researchers in producing relevant knowledge and in
   leveraging additional benefits through collaboration with external
   researchers. The authorship of 1026 papers was highly collaborative,
   with the majority of papers (70 \%) being contributed by external
   researchers. Research was concentrated in five of the 19 parks, and was
   biased towards animal and ecological process studies in savanna
   ecosystems. Researchers have mainly worked in older, larger, and
   arguably more aesthetically-appealing parks that are either close to
   hand or that provide subsidized accommodation to researchers, and that
   have established experimental setups or useful long-term data; smaller
   and more remote parks have received less research attention. Certain
   priority topics for management, such as degradation of freshwater
   ecosystems, global change, marine ecology, and socio-ecological dynamics
   have not received much attention, and are areas identified for growth.
   Embedded authors were found to be more highly connected and influential
   than external researchers, leveraging and connecting many research
   projects. We conclude that there are significant benefits to be gained
   for the management of protected areas through the maintenance of an
   embedded research capability.},

Title = {Toward a Typology of Displacements in the Context of Slow-Onset
   Environmental Degradation. An Analysis of Hazards, Policies, and
   Mobility Patterns},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to develop a typology of displacement in the
   context of slow-onset environmental degradation linked to climate change
   (desertification, droughts and increasing temperatures, sea level rise
   (SLR), loss of biodiversity, land/forest degradation, and glacial
   retreat). We differentiate regions under environmental threat according
   to their social vulnerabilities, mobility patterns, and related
   policies, and identify twelve types of vulnerability/policy/mobility
   combinations. The paper is based on a synthesis of 321 published case
   studies on displacement and slow-onset environmental degradation,
   representing a comprehensive collection of the literature since the
   1970s. We observe that vulnerability is especially critical in small
   island and coastal contexts, as well as in mountainous zones and desert
   regions. Migration processes are often not visible in areas affected by
   environmental degradation. When they do occur, they remain mostly
   internal and oriented towards cities with occasional rural-to-rural
   migration. Non-mobile people, as well as those who depend on natural
   resource industries for their livelihoods, are particularly vulnerable
   to climate change. Persons with lower levels of education are more
   likely to respond to environmental shock through short-distance
   migration, whereas highly educated individuals may migrate over longer
   distances. Policies that directly address mobility in relation to
   climate change-mostly through relocation-are seldom mentioned in the
   literature. Mobility is often perceived as a last-resort solution,
   whereas a growing body of research identifies mobility as an adaptation
   strategy.},

Abstract = {The public health impacts of climate change, and how they can be
   addressed through implementable built-environment interventions in
   non-agricultural-based rural communities, is an understudied area in the
   academic literature and adaptation planning practice, particularly in
   the United States. This paper addresses this gap in understanding
   through a pilot project that developed a climate and health-adaptation
   plan with Marquette County, a geographically large, coastal,
   non-agricultural-based, rural community in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   We show how the Deliberation with Analysis model of public
   participation, supported by visualizations and followed by
   post-participant surveys to measure its impact on barriers to adaptive
   capacity, can be used effectively to overcome barriers to adaptive
   capacity identified in the literature, specifically in understudied
   non-agricultural-based, rural, coastal communities in the United States.
   This study contributes to academic debates on adaptation and rurality by
   displaying the utility of a method that overcomes these key barriers to
   adaptive capacity noted in past research, specifically a lack of public
   awareness, a lack of or difficulty understanding climate information, a
   lack of leadership, and limited coordination and competing priorities.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {146-157},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Because of demographic and tourism increase, coastal areas are facing
   higher numbers of recreational users. Together with other factors
   (environmental quality, protection status), the level of use affects the
   spatial distribution of users. This level also affects the quality of
   user experience, because beyond a certain level, the number of users
   results in decreased user satisfaction; this is the social carrying
   capacity (SCC), which depends on user and site characteristics. This
   study assessed the SCC in a popular coastal area and examined how it
   influences the spatial distribution of users. Boat and visitor counts as
   well as data from a questionnaire-based survey were analyzed to assess
   i) crowding perception, ii) factors affecting the disturbance associated
   with use level, and iii) user's coping strategies when managing high use
   levels. The results demonstrated that crowding perception and
   disturbances associated with use level depend on-site characteristics,
   use level, and user characteristics. Boat type was the main factor
   affecting user's coping strategy. SCC significantly differed between
   sites and according to the use level anticipated by users. The SCC was
   fulfilled at every site within the marine protected areas, except for
   the sites experiencing the lowest use level. This study provides novel
   and valuable information for the field of recreational use management,
   when attempting to achieve either sustainable use goals through SCC
   assessment or biodiversity conservation goals through the effect of SCC
   on the spatial distribution of pressures related to recreational uses.},

Abstract = {The changing geographical distribution of species, or range shift, is
   one of the better documented fingerprints of climate change in the
   marine environment. Range shifts may also lead to dramatic changes in
   the distribution of economic, social, and cultural opportunities. These
   challenge marine resource users' capacity to adapt to a changing climate
   and managers' ability to implement adaptation plans. In particular, a
   reluctance to attribute marine range shift to climate change can
   undermine the effectiveness of climate change communications and pose a
   potential barrier to successful adaptation. Attribution is a known
   powerful predictor of behavioural intention. Understanding the cognitive
   processes that underpin the formation of marine resource users' beliefs
   about the cause of observed marine range shift phenomena is therefore an
   important topic for research. An examination of the attribution by
   marine resource users of three types of range shifts experienced in a
   marine climate change hotspot in southeast Australia to various climate
   and non-climate drivers indicates the existence of at least three
   contributing cognitions. These are: (i) engrained mental representations
   of environmental phenomena, (ii) scientific complexity in the
   attribution pathway, and (iii) dissonance from the positive or negative
   nature of the impact. All three play a part in explaining the complex
   pattern of attribution of marine climate change range shifts, and should
   be considered when planning for engagement with stakeholders and
   managers around adaptation to climate change.},

Journal = {MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {For fisheries to be sustainable, management should account for all major
   sources of fishing mortality. On the Canadian side of Georges Bank,
   landings and discards of transboundary stocks of Atlantic Cod Gadus
   morhua, Haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, and Yellowtail Flounder
   Limanda ferruginea are monitored against quotas that are shared by the
   Canadian groundfish and scallop (sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus)
   fisheries to limit fishing mortality. The shared quota allocations are
   managed using an adaptive quota management system; quota can be
   redistributed between the fisheries during the season to maximize
   fishing opportunities, while still respecting the overall catch limits.
   However, the redistribution relies on estimates of the total end-of-year
   discards of Atlantic Cod, Haddock, and Yellowtail Flounder from the
   scallop fishery. Here, we evaluated and compared two approaches for
   projecting end-of-year discards within season: an empirical method based
   on scallop fishery landings and a seasonal modeling approach. Seasonal
   trends in discards were identified, with discards of all three
   groundfish species highest in April or May. The seasonal models
   out-performed the empirical landings-based projection method, and our
   results demonstrate that accounting for seasonal patterns in discards
   better informs risk-based fishery management decisions.},

Abstract = {Caribbean small island communities are particularly vulnerable to the
   impacts of climate change. While climate policy is often formulated at
   the national level, climate impacts are first felt in local communities.
   This research note, which is part of a larger research project on
   climate change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, reviews the
   recent literature on human system adaptations to climate change at the
   local level in the Caribbean. It seeks to answer two questions: (1) How
   are human systems at the local level adapting to climate change in the
   Caribbean? (2) What challenges exist for local-level climate adaptations
   in human systems that seek to protect vulnerable communities in the
   Caribbean? The studies reviewed highlight the importance of considering
   the vulnerability of sub-populations, protecting their livelihoods, and
   pursuing institutional cooperation at the local and national levels. In
   interrogating whether the recommendations for community adaptations in
   the literature are transferrable to other geographies, this note further

Abstract = {This chapter seeks to analyze the new processes of the Anthropocene
   epoch by examining, in the first part, the relationship with human
   geography and geoethics. In fact, Anthropocene is also faced with an
   ethical and cultural perspective. Geoethics focuses on how scientists
   (natural and social), arts and humanities scholars working in tandem can
   become more aware of their ethical responsibilities to guide society on
   matters related to public safety in the face of natural hazards,
   sustainable use of resources, climate change, and protection of the
   environment. Furthermore, some case studies in the Mediterranean basin,
   where the transformations imposed by human action and society on the
   Earth's environment are evident, will be analyzed in relation to
   Disaster Risk Reduction practices: social perception and communication,
   community resilience, participative approaches, using CIGIS and
   neogeographic technologies. These case studies constitute some examples
   of ``geographies and cartographies of the Anthropocene{''}. In this
   framework, two case studies in the Central Mediterranean will be
   analyzed with the support of Web 2.0 and geohydrological risk perception
   using Community Integrated GIS.},

Title = {Mobilizing private finance for coastal adaptation: A literature review},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal adaptation can reduce climate change impacts and investing now,
   though costly, will bring greater benefits over the longer term,
   particularly in urban areas. Yet public actors currently cover a small
   fraction of needed coastal adaptation investments, a finance gap set to
   widen as coastal adaptation costs continue to increase. Mobilizing
   private finance for coastal adaptation is thus a salient challenge, as
   emphasized in the Paris Agreement. Key under-researched dimensions of
   this challenge are what promotes private investment in coastal
   adaptation and how can public actors' interest in adaptation be aligned
   with private investor interests. To address this, we review the
   literatures on coastal adaptation finance and on financial arrangements
   involving both public actors and private investors. We describe key
   actors and interests, and identify coastal financial arrangements that
   align public actor and private investor interests, finding that private
   provisioning, public-private Partnerships (PPP), and public debt
   arrangements are promising. We then survey empirical examples, finding
   that private provisioning attracts investment when returns are high, for
   example, in urban real estate, and that PPPs attract dredging and
   construction companies' investment, particularly for adaptation measures
   with a large share of operational costs, for example, beach nourishment.
   We find little evidence of institutional investment through public debt
   instruments. A number of policy instruments, for example, concessional
   loans, tax incentives, and standards, may address this gap and enhance
   private coastal adaptation investment. Our results are also relevant for
   other sectors that involve long-term infrastructure adaptation measures.

Title = {Addressing the challenges of climate change risks and adaptation in
   coastal areas: A review},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {156},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change is and will continue altering the world's coasts, which
   are the most densely populated and economically active areas on earth
   and home for highly valuable ecosystems. While there is considerable
   relevant research, in the authors' experience this problem remains
   challenging for coastal engineering. This paper reviews important
   challenges in this respect and identifies three key actions to address
   them: (a) refocusing traditional practice towards more climate-aware
   approaches; (b) developing more comprehensive risk frameworks that
   include the multi-dimensionality and non-stationarity of their
   components and consideration of uncertainty; and (c) building bridges
   between risk assessment and adaptation theory and practice. We conclude
   that the way forward includes numerous activities including increased
   observations; the attribution of coastal impacts to their drivers;
   enhanced climate projections and their integration into impact models;
   more impact assessments at the local scale; dynamic projections of
   spatially-distributed exposure and vulnerability; and the exploration of
   inherently adaptive options. Given the complexity of the possible
   solutions, more practical guidance is required.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) and air pollution are common environmental
   problems in urban areas. However, there is no comprehensive analysis of
   influencing factors and their interactions on land surface temperature
   (LST) and aerosol optical depth (AOD). To propose strategies to
   comprehensively mitigate LST and AOD by optimizing the landscape
   pattern, we used a series of statistical analysis methods to quantify
   the correlation, interactive contribution, and influence mechanism that
   how landscape metrics influenced LST and AOD directly or indirectly. In
   warmer seasons and year, the percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest
   patch index (LPI), aggregation index (AI) in forest land (FL), and mean
   shape index distribution (SHAPE\_MN) in wetlands (WL) were negatively
   correlated with LST and AOD consistently. In contrast, landscape shape
   index (LSI) in FL, patch density (PD) and LSI in WL, edge density (ED),
   PD, LPI, SHAPE\_MN, and LSI in artificial surfaces were positively
   correlated. Landscape metrics were weakly correlated with LST and AOD in
   winter. The climate condition layer was dominant overall. The dominant
   factor layer of landscape composition, landscape configuration and green
   quantity on LST and AOD differed in different land types and seasons.
   Landscape metrics and green quantity could directly or indirectly affect
   LST and AOD, with the direct effects of landscape metrics and green
   quantity being the primary. Increasing the percentage of FL, configuring
   large, aggregated and simple FL, regular, simple and better connected
   wetlands, and increasing patterns in artificial surfaces with simple,
   regular, small and better connectivity characteristics are effective
   mitigation measures. These findings can be helpful in developing UHI and
   air pollution adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Geoscientists play an increasingly important role in understanding
   climate change and its impacts. This is especially the case with
   adaptation to climate change which cannot be solved in isolated
   attempts, but calls for international cooperation and integrated
   approaches. The potential effects of climate change on natural hazards,
   as well as water and energy resources, are of great concern to
   geoscientists and stakeholders. Climate change has only recently been
   incorporated into decision-making processes and spatial planning. In
   order to facilitate communication of potential impacts of climate
   change, and to determine strategies and measures to adapt to those, in
   October 2009 the RIGS Commission on Geoscience for Environmental
   Management (GEM) established a Working Group on Climate Change
   Adaptation (http://climate.iugsgem.org/).
   This article presents some results of projects on climate change
   adaptation in the Baltic Sea Region (conducted by multi-disciplinary

Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While climate change is one of the greatest environmental threats the
   entire world faces today, rapid urbanization is making both the
   community and ecosystem more vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change. Estimating urban resilience is thus one of the important
   processes to understanding the current and potential future risks of
   cities providing practical policies and qualified strategies to cope
   with climate change effects. This study presents a disaster risk
   analysis in Southern Taiwan at the municipal and zone levels using the
   Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI). The index was estimated at
   both the zone and city scale of three coastal cities, namely Tainan,
   Kaohsiung, and Pingtung. The CDRI approach consists of five different
   dimensions (physical, social, economic, institutional, and natural),
   with several parameters and variables reflecting the abilities,
   strength, and threats of case study cities to cope with potential
   climate-related disasters. The findings show that, while the physical
   dimension has the highest resilience among cities, the lowest average
   scores and the least resilience belong to the natural dimension. The
   overall CDRI score for different cites also revealed various
   capabilities, shortcomings, drawbacks, and potential risks of neighbored
   cities in the same region. It is expected that the findings of this
   study shall serve as an urban planning tool to recognize the sectors
   within an urban context that are more or less resilient, enhance actions
   at the local level, and support future planning decisions.},

Abstract = {Traditional top-down methods for resource management ask first what
   future conditions will be, then identify the best action(s) to take in
   response to that prediction. Even when acknowledging uncertainty about
   the future, standard approaches (a) characterize uncertainties
   probabilistically, then optimize objectives in expectation, and/or (b)
   develop a small number of representative scenarios to explore variation
   in outcomes under different policy responses. This leaves planners
   vulnerable to surprise if future conditions diverge from predictions. In
   this review, we describe contemporary approaches to decision support
   that address deep uncertainty about future external forcings, system
   responses, and stakeholder preferences for different outcomes. Many of
   these methods are motivated by climate change adaptation, infrastructure
   planning, or natural resources management, and they provide dramatic
   improvements in the robustness of management strategies. We outline
   various methods conceptually and describe how they have been applied in

Abstract = {Sea-level rise poses considerable risks to coastal communities,
   ecosystems, and infrastructure. Decision makers are faced with uncertain
   sea-level projections when designing a strategy for coastal adaptation.
   The traditional methods are often silent on tradeoffs as well as the
   effects of tail-area events and of potential future learning. Here we
   reformulate a simple sea-level rise adaptation model to address these
   concerns. We show that Direct Policy Search yields improved solution
   quality, with respect to Pareto-dominance in the objectives, over the
   traditional approach under uncertain sea-level rise projections and
   storm surge. Additionally, the new formulation produces high quality
   solutions with less computational demands than an intertemporal
   optimization approach. Our results illustrate the utility of
   multi-objective adaptive formulations for the example of coastal
   adaptation and point to wider-ranging application in climate change
   adaptation decision problems.},

Abstract = {Air pollution is an environmental and social issue at different spatial
   scales, especially in a climate change context, with an expected
   decrease of air quality. Despite the technological evolution of the last
   decades in the transport sector, road traffic emissions are still one
   major source of air pollution at the city level. The main goal of this
   study was to evaluate the influence of a set of resilience measures,
   based on nature-based solutions, in the wind flow and in the dispersion
   of air pollutants, in a built-up area in Portugal. For that, two
   pollutants were analysed (NOx and PM10) and four scenarios were
   developed: i) a baseline scenario, ii) an urban green scenario, iii) a
   green roof scenario, and iv) a ``grey{''} scenario (without trees). Two
   models were used, namely the Weather Research and Forecasting model
   (WRF) and the CFD model VADIS (pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere
   under variable wind conditions). The WRF model was used to initialize
   the CFD model, while the last was one used to perform the set of
   numerical simulations, on hourly basis. The implementation of a green
   urban area promoted a reduction of air pollutants concentrations, of
   about 16\% {[}PM10] and 19\% {[}NOx] in the overall domain; while the
   application of green roofs showed an increase of concentrations
   (reaching 60\% during specific time periods). Overall the results showed
   that a strategic placement of vegetation in cities has the potential to
   make an important contribution to the improvement of air quality and
   sustainability of urban environments.},

Abstract = {High-impact storm events have demonstrated the vulnerability of coastal
   zones in Europe and beyond. These impacts are likely to increase due to
   predicted climate change and ongoing coastal development. In order to
   reduce impacts, disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures need to be taken,
   which prevent or mitigate the effects of storm events. To drive the DRR
   agenda, the UNISDR formulated the Sendai Framework for Action, and the
   EU has issued the Floods Directive. However, neither is specific about
   the methods to be used to develop actionable DRR measures in the coastal
   zone. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods, tools and
   approaches which make it possible to: identify and prioritize the
   coastal zones which are most at risk through a Coastal Risk Assessment
   Framework, and to evaluate the effectiveness of DRR options for these
   coastal areas, using an Early Warning/Decision Support System, which can
   be used both in the planning and event-phase. This paper gives an
   overview of the products and results obtained in the FP7-funded project
   RISC-KIT, which aims to develop and apply a set of tools with which
   highly-vulnerable coastal areas (so-called ``hotspots{''}) can be
   identified.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) has an important role in terms of food
   security and socio-economic development of the region. The VMD is a
   densely populated area and is a social and economic hotspot for coastal
   hazard risks and vulnerability. The amount of people exposed to
   flooding, storm surges and seasonal river floods in VMD is estimated to
   increase as the sea level rises, land-use changes and urbanization in
   flood-prone areas is growing. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on
   assessing and mapping flood hazard, risk and vulnerability of the Mekong
   delta. There are many flood hazard and risk studies carried out in the
   VMD, however very little is done with respect to vulnerability. The
   region is facing a rapid economic growth and vulnerability to floods
   becomes an important issue to be addressed.
   The study presented here focuses on mapping of the vulnerability of the
   VMD, based on the situation in the area and on the available data. The
   study evaluates the VMD districts from vulnerability point of view and
   presents maps, which will be helpful to the decision makers who need to
   take measures on how to reduce and mitigate the flood impact in the
   area. Collaboration between deltas' administrations, multiple
   stakeholders and organizations, at national and international level
   (delta alliances), has to be undertaken to support the most vulnerable
   areas and to learn from each other. Mapping vulnerability offers the
   opportunity to get a broad overview on affected areas and on possible
   adaptation options that could be applied, directing resources at more
   in-depth investigation of the most promising adaptation strategies.
   Moreover, at a later stage, it can also serve to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the adaptation measures.
   The present study presents a map of flood vulnerability for the VMD for
   the years 2000 and 2050 (see Main Map). The map is created by applying
   Coastal Cities Flood Vulnerability Index (CCFVI) methodology; the flood
   map will overlay flood hazard in order to create flood risk maps using
   tools such as ArcGIS.},

   bottom-trawling in the Falkland Islands (Southwest Atlantic)},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {In the Falkland Islands, the South American fur seal and South American
   sea lion spatially overlap and interact with bottom-trawling fisheries.
   Until 2015, interactions of these species with the Patagonian bottom
   trawl squid fishery were uncommon. During the second fishing season 2017
   a dramatic increase in seal interactions was observed, with a
   corresponding increase in incidental mortalities. Various mitigation
   measures were applied, seal exclusion devices (SEDs) fitted inside a net
   extension inserted between the trawl net and cod-end being the most
   efficient. The SEDs became mandatory in the fishery in September 2017.
   Since then, the number of seal mortalities remains negligible. SED
   efficiency is monitored by 100 \% observer coverage. To the best of our
   knowledge, the Falkland Islands Patagonian squid fishery is currently
   the only trawl fishery in the Southwest Atlantic with full observer
   coverage and SED usage. It is hoped in the near future similar
   mitigation measures extend to other coastal countries whose fisheries
   also interact with these otariids.},

Title = {Optimism for mitigation of climate warming impacts for sea turtles

Abstract = {Increasing incubation temperatures may threaten the viability of sea
   turtle populations. We explored opportunities for decreasing incubation
   temperatures at a Caribbean rookery with extreme female-biased hatchling
   production. To investigate the effect of artificial shading,
   temperatures were measured under simple materials (white sheet, white
   sand, palm leaves). To test natural drivers of incubation temperature,
   temperatures were measured at average nest depths with shading on two
   beaches. Results from a pilot experiment suggest the most effective
   material was palm leaves. Shading decreased temperatures by a mean of
   0.60 degrees C (SE = 0.10 degrees C, N = 20). Variation between beaches
   averaged 1.88 degrees C (SE = 0.13 degrees C, N = 20). We used long-term
   rookery data combined with experimental data to estimate the effect on
   sex ratio: relocation and shading could shift ratios from current ranges
   (97-100\% female) to 60-90\% female. A conservation mitigation matrix
   summarises our evidence that artificial shading and nest relocation are
   effective, low-cost, low-technology conservation strategies to mitigate
   impacts of climate warming for sea turtles.},

Abstract = {Food security assessment in sub-Saharan Africa requires simultaneous
   consideration of multiple socio-economic and environmental variables.
   Early identification of populations at risk enables timely and
   appropriate action. Since large and widely dispersed populations depend
   on rainfed agriculture and pastoralism, climate monitoring and
   forecasting are important inputs to food security analysis. Satellite
   rainfall estimates (RFE) fill in gaps in station observations, and serve
   as input to drought index maps and crop water balance models. Gridded
   rainfall time-series give historical context, and provide a basis for
   quantitative interpretation of seasonal precipitation forecasts. RFE are
   also used to characterize flood hazards, in both simple indices and
   stream flow models. In the future, many African countries are likely to
   see negative impacts on subsistence agriculture due to the effects of
   global warming. Increased climate variability is forecast, with more
   frequent extreme events. Ethiopia requires special attention. Already
   facing a food security emergency, troubling persistent dryness has been
   observed in some areas, associated with a positive trend in Indian Ocean
   sea surface temperatures. Increased African capacity for rainfall
   observation, forecasting, data management and modelling applications is
   urgently needed. Managing climate change and increased climate
   variability require these fundamental technical capacities if creative
   coping strategies are to be devised.},

Title = {Winter Wheat Phenology Variation and Its Response to Climate Change in
   Shandong Province, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Crop phenology is considered to be an important indicator reflecting the
   biophysical and physiological processes of crops facing climate change.
   Therefore, quantifying crop phenology change and its relationship with
   climate variables is of great significance for developing agricultural
   management and adaptation strategies to cope with global warming. Based
   on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced
   Vegetation Index (EVI) product, winter wheat green-up date, heading
   date, jointing date, and maturity date were first retrieved by
   Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering and threshold methods and then the
   variation of winter wheat phenology and its correlation with mean
   (T-mean), minimum (T-min), and maximum (T-max) temperature and
   precipitation (P-re) during 2003-2019 were comprehensively analyzed in
   Shandong Province, China. Results showed that green-up date, jointing
   date, heading date, and maturity date generally ranged from 50-70 DOY,
   75-95 DOY, 100-120 DOY, and 130-150 DOY. Winter wheat phenology
   presented a spatial pattern of the South earlier than the North and the
   inland earlier than the coastal regions. For every 1 degrees increase in
   latitude/longitude, green-up date, jointing date, heading date, and
   maturity date were respectively delayed by 3.93 days/0.43 days, 2.31
   days/1.19 days, 2.80 days/1.14 days, and 2.12 days/1.09 days. Green-up
   date and jointing date were both advanced in the West and delayed in the
   Eastern coastal areas and the South, and heading date and maturity date
   respectively showed a widespread advance and a delayed tendency in
   Shandong Province, however, the trend of winter wheat phenological
   changes was generally insignificant. In addition, green-up date,
   jointing date, and heading date generally presented a significant
   negative correlation with mean/minimum temperature, while maturity date
   was positively associated with the current month maximum temperature,
   notably in the West of Shandong Province. Regarding precipitation, a
   generally insignificant relationship with winter wheat phenology was
   detected. Results in this study are anticipated to provide insight into
   the impact of climate change on winter wheat phenology and to supply
   reference for the agricultural production and field management of winter
   wheat in Shandong Province, China.},

Title = {Estimating global damages from sea level rise with the Coastal Impact
   and Adaptation Model (CIAM)},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {143-156},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal sector impacts from sea level rise (SLR) are a key component of
   the projected economic damages of climate change, a major input to
   decision-making and design of climate policy. Moreover, the ultimate
   global costs to coastal resources will depend strongly on adaptation,
   society's response to cope with the local impacts. This paper presents a
   new open-source optimization model to assess global coastal impacts from
   SLR from the perspective of economic efficiency. The Coastal Impact and
   Adaptation Model (CIAM) determines the optimal strategy for adaptation
   at the local level, evaluating over 12,000 coastal segments, as
   described in the DIVA database (Vafeidis et al. 2006), based on their
   socioeconomic characteristics and the potential impacts of relative sea
   level rise and uncertain sea level extremes. A deterministic application
   of CIAM demonstrates the model's ability to assess local impacts and
   direct costs, choose the least-cost adaptation, and estimate global net
   damages for several climate scenarios that account for both global and
   local components of SLR (Kopp et al. 2014). CIAM finds that there is
   large potential for coastal adaptation to reduce the expected impacts of
   SLR compared to the alternative of no adaptation, lowering global net
   present costs through 2100 by a factor of seven to less than \$1.7
   trillion, although this does not include initial transition costs to
   overcome an under-adapted current state. In addition to producing
   aggregate estimates, CIAM results can also be interpreted at the local
   level, where retreat (e.g., relocate inland) is often a more
   cost-effective adaptation strategy than protect (e.g., construct
   physical defenses).},

Abstract = {Climate change poses a potential risk to coastal infrastructure, thus
   threatening the economics or even the safety of human beings. Thus, a
   better understanding of the attitude of port organizations toward
   climate adaptation and mitigation is essential. This paper addresses
   this research gap by investigating 18 port organizations in China. The
   questions include the impediments and the impact of context, systems,
   and other factors on the implementation of adaptation strategies. The
   results indicate that port organizations are generally aware of climate
   change impacts and agree that some further steps are needed. However,
   policy support serves as a key factor in implementing adaptation plans.
   Apart from offering important insight on the attitude of port
   organizations, the study also serves as a platform for further research
   on climate adaptation planning in China.},

Title = {Perception of Climate Change in Shrimp-Farming Communities in
   Bangladesh: A Critical Assessment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Local contexts as well as levels of exposure play a substantial role in
   defining a community's perception of climate and environmental
   vulnerabilities. In order to assess a community's adaptation strategies,
   understanding of how different groups in that community comprehend
   climate change is crucial. Public risk perception is important as it can
   induce or confine political, economic, and social actions dealing with
   particular hazards. Climate change adaptation is a well-established
   policy discourse in Bangladesh that has made its people more or less
   aware of it. Similarly, shrimp-farming communities in southwestern
   Bangladesh understand environmental and climate change in their own
   ways. In order to understand how the shrimp-farming communities in
   coastal Bangladesh perceive current climate instabilities, we conducted
   a qualitative study in shrimp-farming villages in coastal Bangladesh
   where about 80\% of commercial shrimp of the country is cultivated. We
   compared farmers' perceptions of local climate change with existing
   scientific knowledge and found remarkable similarities. Our assessment
   shows that at least two factors are critical for this outcome: coastal
   people's exposure to and experience of frequent climate extremes; and a
   radical approach to defining climate regimes in Bangladesh by various
   stakeholders and the media, depicting anthropogenic global warming as a
   certainty for the country. Thus, a convergence of scientific construct
   and sociocultural construct construes the level of awareness of the
   general public about climate change.},

Title = {Innovative Sustainable Drought Management Strategy Incorporating
   Forensic Techniques and Policy Framework},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {122-139},
Abstract = {The ever-growing human population and the changing food habits of the
   expanding middle class in emerging economies with more and more advanced
   technological needs, along with foreseeable changes in climate (global
   warming) due to intensified human activity may exacerbate the occurrence
   and magnitude of droughts all over the world. Both this generation and
   future generations are left vulnerable to droughts that could have
   serious global consequences. Droughts are already an integral part of
   global climate variability, but their impact can be mitigated
   significantly by proactive risk management planning and preparedness
   emphasizing increase in water supplies with appropriate reduction in
   demands, strengthening regulatory framework, education, emergency
   responses and community rehabilitation services. Sustainable mitigation
   initiatives are needed to protect life and manage risks and damages to
   property, agriculture, industries, ecological biodiversity and natural
   resources. Forensic applications can help in many ways, for example, to
   understand interaction between components of hydrologic cycle, to
   determine their origin and history, in land use classification, to
   locate recharge areas, and in the management of water quality, as well
   as to determine the time of release, to identify the sources of
   pollution and dominant ongoing biochemical reactions, to resolve
   disputes, and to synthesize missing historic data that are so critical
   in the planning for worst droughts. Weather forecasting capabilities can
   reduce uncertainties and help in drought preparedness and mitigation
   strategies. This article reviews global weather pattern and interactions
   as well as coupled ocean-land-atmosphere phenomenon (El Nino Southern
   Oscillation and/or La Nina {[}ENSO] ENSO) causing interannual global
   climate variability, drought preparedness planning and policies, and
   mitigation strategies to conserve water, enhance water use efficiencies,
   to promote sustainable socioeconomic development, and to preserve values
   of natural resources. Potential applications of classic and emerging
   forensic fingerprinting techniques and materials to enhance and harness
   diverse sources of water and address growing water needs now and in the
   future are also discussed. Finally, an innovative sustainable drought
   management strategy is proposed.},

   Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coastal areas in South Asian countries are particularly vulnerable to
   elevated water salinity. Drinking water salinity has been found to be
   associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diarrhea, and abdominal
   pain. Our study aimed to find if excess drinking water salinity was
   associated with increased hospital visits with an array of health
   effects in coastal sub-districts of Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study
   was conducted with 157 participants from three coastal sub-districts. A
   face-to-face interview was conducted to collect salinity exposure and
   hospital visit data. Water samples were collected from both drinking and
   other household water sources for the measurement of salinity and total
   dissolved solids (TDS). CVD, diarrhea, and abdominal pain related
   hospital visits were found to be significantly associated with high
   water salinity and TDS. Households exposed to high salinity demonstrated
   a higher frequency of hospital visits than the low salinity-exposed
   households. People exposed to high salinity seemed to lack awareness
   regarding salinity-inducing health effects. Water salinity is a public
   health concern that will continue to rise due to climate change.
   Therefore, raising awareness about the health risks of water salinity is
   essential for the government to frame policies and mitigation strategies
   to control this emerging threat.},

Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {Climate change has elucidated already existing gender inequalities
   associated with unequal access to resources, decision-making processes,
   and higher exposure to environmental shocks and stressors. Growing
   acknowledgment of the gender-differentiated implications of climate
   change in recent years has placed gender equality as a focal point in
   international discourses on climate change adaptation. The policy
   perspective of gender equality is universalized, but how it transcribes
   in local climate change adaptation projects remains elusive. Using the
   relocation of Vunidogoloa, Fiji, this article explores the tension and
   compatibility between the way gender equality is discussed and how it is

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {123-133},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise as a result of climate change increases inundation and
   erosion, which are affected by a complex interplay of physical
   environmental parameters at the coast. China's coast is vulnerable to
   accelerated sea-level rise and associated coastal flooding because of
   physical and socio-economical factors such as its low topography, highly
   developed economy, and highly dense population. To identify vulnerable
   sections of the coast, this paper presents a national assessment of the
   vulnerability of the Chinese coast using 8 physical variables: sea-level
   rise, coastal geomorphology, elevation, slope, shoreline erosion, land
   use, mean tide range, and mean wave height. A coastal vulnerability
   index was calculated by integrating the differentially weighted rank
   values of the 8 variables, based on which the coastline is segmented
   into 4 classes. The results show that 3\% of the 18,000-km-long Chinese
   coast is very highly vulnerable, 29\% is highly vulnerable, 58\% is
   moderately vulnerable, and 10\% is in the low-vulnerable class. Findings
   further reveal that large amounts of land and population will be
   vulnerable to inundation by coastal flooding from sea level rise and
   storm surge. Finally, some suggestions are presented for decision makers
   and other concerned stakeholders to develop appropriate coastal zone
   management and mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {In many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS), such as in Kiribati, formal national adaptation
   programmes are currently being operationalised or are in the pipeline. A
   key focus is on motivating householders to adapt in anticipation of
   climate change through pilot community projects. In this paper, we argue
   that the water sector must pay equal attention to how communities
   cognitively perceive the process of adaptation if interventions are to
   be effective. Adopting a cognitive model to gain such insights we
   conclude that individual's belief in their own abilities to manage water
   stress play a crucial role in driving intentions to adapt and therefore
   greater attention needs to be placed on understanding the underling
   drivers shaping such beliefs. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change on coastal risk factors are increasing due
   to both rising sea levels and increasingly intense coastal floodings.
   However, these changes are only just beginning to be incorporated into
   planning strategies for coastal economies and land use in France. Recent
   coastal storms marked the turning point, and public authorities have now
   started to revise coastal management legislation, stating that the
   managed retreat of settlements and infrastructure is the preferred
   strategy to adapt to climate change. To date, this managed retreat has
   almost exclusively been discussed in relation to the current political,
   social, and economic obstacles that make it difficult to relocate
   equipment and houses inland. Here, we add to this discussion by
   depicting how the careful ecological restoration of dunes and salt
   marshes on land made available by managed retreat could overcome some of
   these obstacles. First, we describe three possible strategies to adapt
   to sea-level rise as well as the maladaptation of the current strategy.
   Then, we focus on the limitations and advantages of ecological
   restoration in terms of managed retreat and vice versa. Finally, we
   depict how a new kind of land lease, introduced in draft legislation,
   can help tackle the multitemporal and multispatial issues that currently
   hinder managed retreat.},

   Geoinventory tool capability that allows any shoreline related data to
   be searched, displayed and analyzed on a map viewer. Users will be able
   to select sections of the shoreline and generate statistical reports in
   the map viewer to allow for comparisons. The tool will also facilitate
   map-based discussion forums and creation of user groups to encourage
   citizen participation in decisions regarding shoreline stabilization and
   restoration, thereby promoting sustainable coastal development.},

   for enhancing resilience},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {240},
Pages = {56-72},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Microgrids are considered as a potential solution to deal with major
   power disruption events due to their ability of islanding and potential
   to sustain the penetration of renewables. In order to elaborate the role
   of microgrids in enhancing the resilience of power systems, a three-step
   analysis is carried out in this paper. In the first step, the general
   backgrounds of resilience in power systems are presented, which comprise
   of disaster modeling, resilience analysis methods, and resilience
   enhancement efforts by different regions. In the second step, the use of
   microgrids as a resilience resource is analyzed, where formation of
   microgrids, networked microgrids, and dynamic microgrids along with
   resiliency of multi-energy networks are explored. In the third step, the
   strategies utilized by microgrids for enhancing their resilience during
   major outage events are analyzed. These strategies include proactive
   scheduling, outage management, feasible islanding, and advanced
   operation strategies for reducing the impact of major disruptions. The
   classification of these operation strategies is based on the event
   occurrence and clearance times. In addition, the resilience strategies
   used by different types of microgrids, types of energy management
   systems, communication resilience, and resilience of individual
   components in micro grids are also analyzed. Finally, research gaps in
   the existing literature and future directions for improving the
   available resilience-oriented operation methods for enhancing the
   resilience of microgrids are presented.},

Abstract = {Random linear packet coding combined with adaptive power and rate
   control is being considered as an alternative to traditional ARQ
   techniques for the underwater acoustic channel. We first analyze a
   scheme where the number of coded packets to transmit is determined so as
   to achieve a pre-determined reliability at the receiver, and hence
   eliminate the need for explicit feedback. We next investigate joint
   power and rate control with constrained resources. Using the channel
   gain information which is obtained via feedback from the receiver, the
   transmitter adjusts its transmit power and the number of coded packets
   such that the average energy per bit is minimized. We impose two main
   constraints for the optimization: (a) the transmit power should be
   within a maximum available power, and (b) the number of coded packets
   should not exceed a maximum value. Under these constraints, we define
   adaptation policies to minimize the average energy per bit and show
   analytical results for average energy savings available from the
   adaptation policies. We also show experimental results obtained using
   the measured channel gains from the SPACE-08 experiment, an at-sea
   experiment conducted off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in
   Massachusetts.},

Journal = {ARCTIC},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {389-400},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is recognized as an important policy issue
   by international bodies such as the United Nations and by various
   national governments. Initiatives to identify adaptation needs and to
   improve adaptive capacity increasingly start with an assessment of the
   vulnerability of the system of interest, in terms of who and what are
   vulnerable, to what stresses, in what way, and what capacity exists to
   adapt to changing risks. Notwithstanding the scholarship on climate
   change itself, there are few studies on the nature of Arctic
   communities' vulnerability to climate-change risks. We review existing
   literature on implications of climate change for Arctic communities,
   develop a conceptual model of vulnerability, and present an analytical
   approach to assessing climate hazards and coping strategies in Arctic
   communities. Vulnerability is conceptualized as a function of exposure
   to climatic stresses and the adaptive capacity to cope with these
   stresses. The analytical framework employs place-specific case studies
   involving community residents and integrates information from multiple
   sources, both to document current exposures and adaptations and to
   characterize future exposures and adaptive capacity.},

Abstract = {Identifying the role of temperature on species-specific performance is
   critical for predicting how species will respond to temperature
   increases expected under climate change. We compared the thermal
   performance of two sympatric Pacific rockfish species complexes
   (controls for relatedness and geographic location) that vary in larval
   life-history traits associated with different oceanographic regimes
   including temperature during early life-history stages: the BY complex
   (Black: Sebastes melanops, Yellowtail: S. flavidus) and the CQ complex
   (Copper: S. caurinus, Quillback: S. maliger). By using controlled
   experiments, we evaluated foraging activity, growth, and survival of
   young-of-the-year rockfish recruits under current and future habitat
   temperatures over a 14-day time period indicative of marine heatwave
   events expected with climate change. BY rockfish displayed a
   heat-intolerant behaviour by only foraging at temperatures within
   current habitat temperatures, whereas the CQ rockfish displayed a
   heat-tolerant behaviour by actively foraging at temperatures above
   current and future predicted temperatures for a limited time. Although
   growth and survival in each species significantly declined with
   temperature, the magnitude of the effect did not vary between species.
   Taken together, our results show that rockfish are capable of using
   different behavioural strategies to cope with warming and may be
   differentially impacted by future climate conditions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {145},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The uncertainty of water resources availability is a growing problem in
   California as agricultural industrialization, population growth, and
   climate change affect water resources. The intense manipulation of the
   hydrological regime has led to the depletion of the water resources in
   the state and the subsequent use of various adaptive management
   strategies to cope with environmental conditions and social concerns.
   The historical imbalance between water pumping and replenishment in
   Pajaro Valley has led to overdrafted aquifers, seawater intrusion, and
   salinization. The objective of this study is to estimate the sustainable
   carrying capacity of agricultural land in Pajaro Valley while preventing
   groundwater overdraft. A groundwater box model was built and calibrated
   using historical data to represent current and future hydrology and
   water management strategies. An optimization model maximized the
   economic profit using the agricultural acreage as the decision variable
   with a set of constraints aimed at determining the sustainable carrying
   capacity of the groundwater basin. Model constraints include total land
   and water availability, crop acreage, agricultural water use, and
   historical demand. In the Pajaro Valley, agricultural operations must
   use less water more efficiently, which means changes in crop types, size
   of activities, and fallowing land in parts of the basin. Results of the
   optimal scenario over 25 years show a 15\% reduction of total
   agricultural acreage, 8.5\% reduction in food production, average profit
   loss of 4\%, and a 79\% reduction in aquifer depletion. This study
   provides an overall vision of what can be accomplished with coordinated
   land use planning using strategies that harmonize individual decisions
   and shared natural resources.},

Abstract = {The Regional Workshop on Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation
   Assessment in Asia and the Pacific met to present and discuss
   assessments of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in
   agriculture, forests, coastal resources, and water resources.
   Discussions were held in breakout and plenary sessions about the state
   of the science for vulnerability and adaptation assessment conclusions
   that can be drawn about the vulnerability of the region to climate
   change, and where future research efforts should be directed. The
   workshop concluded that sea level rise is of greatest concern to island
   and coastal nations in the region, climate change will have a
   significant effect on agriculture, water resources are sensitive to
   changes in average climate conditions and to tropical monsoons and
   cyclones, and forests could be significantly affected by climate change.
   The workshop recommended that efforts to improve general circulation
   models continue and that countries in the region cooperate on the
   analyses of vulnerability and addressing adaptation measures. The
   workshop also concluded that results of vulnerability and adaptation
   assessments should be presented to policy makers and the public and that
   assessments continue to be undertaken to improve our understanding of
   the issue.},

Title = {Vulnerability of the coastal zone of The Gambia to sea level rise and
   development of response strategies and adaptation options},

   Climate Change, HARARE, ZIMBABWE, MAR 07-15, 1995},
Organization = {US Country Studies Program},
Abstract = {The coastal zone of The Gambia consists of 70 km open ocean coast and
   200 km sheltered coast. Only about 20 km of the open coastline is
   significantly developed and this includes Banjul (the capital city),
   Bakau and Cape St. Mary, Fajara and the Tourism Development Area (TDA).
   Tourism is the most important economic sector in the coastal zone and
   contributes about 10\% of the government revenue. Fisheries and
   agriculture are also important coastal industries. In this study the
   Aerial Videotape-assisted Vulnerability Analysis (AVVA) technique has
   been used to provide a detailed analysis of vulnerability to sea level
   rise, and adaptation strategies have been identified. The data used
   includes a video recording of the coastline, color infrared and black
   and white aerial photography, topographic maps, bathymetric maps, a
   geological map of The Gambia and still photographs. The data have been
   used to characterize the coastal zone into 9 geomorphological units,
   wherein the cultural and heritage sites of economic importance have been
   delineated and characterized according to their biophysical and economic
   importance. Future erosion rates have been projected by applying the
   Bruun Rule, and future total land loss due to inundation in response to
   global warming and accelerated sea level rise has been determined. The
   sea level rise scenarios considered are 0.2 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m per
   century. Inundation is estimated to be about 92.32 x 10(6) m(2) for a
   1.0 m sea level rise, 45.89 x 10(6) m(2) for a 0.5 m sea level rise and
   4.96 x 10(6) m(2) for a 0.2 m sea level rise. The greater part of this
   area lost will be wetlands and mangrove systems important for fish
   spawning areas and habitats for wildlife. Shoreline retreat is estimated
   to vary between about 6.8 m in cliffy areas to about 880 m for more flat
   and sandy areas based on the Bruun Rule. Population and physical
   structures at risk have been determined. Attempts have been made to
   report this loss in monetary terms, but firm figures are not yet
   available. Only one unit of the coastal zone has been evaluated. In this
   unit, it is expected that the capital city will be completely lost
   through both erosion and inundation within 50 to 60 yr with a total of
   42000 persons displaced. Lands and physical structures to be lost are
   estimated at US\$ 217 million. Response strategies and adaptation
   options identified include: innovative sand management, building and
   rehabilitation of groins, construction of revetments to protect
   important areas, construction of sea-walls/bulkheads, public outreach
   and awareness, building regulations and urban growth planning, wetland
   preservation and mitigation, and development of a coastal zone
   management plan.},

Abstract = {Coastlines are changing, wildfires are raging, cities are getting
   hotter, and spatial designers are charged with the task of designing to
   mitigate these unknowns. This research examines computational digital
   workflows to understand and alleviate the impacts of climate change on
   urban landscapes. The methodology includes two separate simulation and
   visualization workflows. The first workflow uses an animated particle
   fluid simulator in combination with geographic information systems data,
   Photoshop software, and three-dimensional modeling and animation
   software to simulate erosion and sedimentation patterns, coastal
   inundation, and sea level rise. The second workflow integrates building
   information modeling data, computational fluid dynamics simulators, and
   parameters from EnergyPlus and Landsat to produce typologies and
   strategies for mitigating urban heat island effects. The effectiveness
   of these workflows is demonstrated by inserting design prototypes into
   modeled environments to visualize their success or failure. The result
   of these efforts is a suite of workflows which have the potential to
   vastly improve the efficacy with which architects and landscape
   architects use existing data to address the urgency of climate change.},

Title = {Institutional inertia in European fisheries-Insights from the Atlantic
   horse mackerel case},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fisheries management has to deal with uncertainty about the genetic
   composition and the location of fish stocks. If institutions are inert,
   i.e. unable to adapt to new insights, management may not be effective.
   This paper analyses fisheries management in Europe which relies on
   scientific advice feeding into the management decision process. The
   spatial boundaries of fish stocks define the scientific areas and
   management areas, which are not necessarily aligned. Even if new
   scientific information on the stock composition and location leads to
   changes in scientific areas, the management areas are usually not
   adjusted. This causes an institutional mismatch which violates the
   self-imposed good governance principles of the EU. We use the North Sea
   and the Western horse mackerel stocks to gain some insights in the
   process of renegotiating new management areas and national fisheries
   quotas. We find that distributional concerns around allocating quota are
   a key obstacle for an adjustment of management areas. We suggest to
   pre-define a transparent mechanism to facilitate adapting management
   areas to scientific areas.},

Title = {Adapting Railway Maintenance to Climate Change},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Railway infrastructure is vulnerable to extreme weather events such as
   elevated temperature, flooding, storms, intense winds, sea level rise,
   poor visibility, etc. These events have extreme consequences for the
   dependability of railway infrastructure and the acceptable level of
   services by infrastructure managers and other stakeholders. It is quite
   complex and difficult to quantify the consequences of climate change on
   railway infrastructure because of the inherent nature of the railway
   itself. Hence, the main aim of this work is to qualitatively identify
   and assess the impact of climate change on railway infrastructure with
   associated risks and consequences. A qualitative research methodology is
   employed in the study using a questionnaire as a tool for information
   gathering from experts from several municipalities in Sweden, Swedish
   transport infrastructure managers, maintenance organizations, and train
   operators. The outcome of this questionnaire revealed that there was a
   lower level of awareness about the impact of climate change on the
   various facets of railway infrastructure. Furthermore, the work
   identifies the challenges and barriers for climate adaptation of railway
   infrastructure and suggests recommended actions to improve the
   resilience towards climate change. It also provides recommendations,
   including adaptation options to ensure an effective and efficient
   railway transport service.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on potato cultivation in Montenegro was
   assessed. Three scenarios (A1B, A1Bs and A2) for 2001-2030, 2071-2100
   and 2071-2100, respectively, were generated by a regional climate model
   and compared with the baseline period 1961-1990. The results indicated
   an increase of temperature during the summer season from 1.3 to 4.8
   degrees C in the mountain region and from 1 to 3.4 degrees C in the
   coastal zone. The precipitation decreased between 5 and 50\% depending
   on the scenario, region and season. The changes in temperature and
   precipitation influenced phenology, yield and water needs. The impact
   was more pronounced in the coastal areas than in the mountain regions.
   The growing season was shortened 13.6, 22.9 and 29.7 days for A1B, A1Bs
   and A2, respectively. The increase of irrigation requirement was 4.0,
   19.5 and 7.3 mm for A1B, A1Bs and A2, respectively. For the baseline
   conditions, yield reduction under rainfed cultivation was lower than
   30\%. For A1B, A1Bs and A2 scenarios, yield reductions were 31.0 +/-
   8.2, 36.3 +/- 11.6 and 34.1 +/- 10.9\%, respectively. Possible
   adaptation measures include shifting of production to the mountain
   (colder) areas and irrigation application. Rainfed cultivation remains a
   viable solution when the anticipation of sowing is adopted.},

Title = {Effects of supplemental watering on loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests
   and hatchlings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {534},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The influence of environmental conditions during sea turtle egg
   development makes the ongoing threat of climate change particularly
   concerning. The nest environment greatly influences several aspects of
   sea turtle hatchling biology, including developmental rate and sexual
   differentiation. Various studies examine the effectiveness of watering
   nests as a mitigation strategy for high temperatures and dry conditions
   but few have rigorously identified the impacts across multiple nesting
   seasons and weather conditions. This study experimentally examined the
   impact of increased moisture on loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta)
   hatchling sex ratios and hatching success across three nesting seasons.
   Supplemental water was added to experimental treatments while control
   treatments received only ambient water as rainfall. Sand moisture and
   nest temperature were measured throughout incubation. Overall, watering
   nests lowered nest temperatures and increased nest sand moisture.
   Watered nests had significantly higher hatching success; however, nests
   that received the highest treatment amounts had similar hatching success
   as controls. After hatchlings emerged, nests were inventoried and a
   sample of hatchlings from each nest was collected and their sex was
   verified. Only nests watered with the highest water volume treatment
   produced significantly more males. Watering nests may mediate the

Abstract = {The vulnerability of fisheries to climate change in Mexico is explored
   on the basis of an overview of the possible impacts of physical
   variables of ecosystems and habitats which sustain these fisheries,
   taking in consideration the socioeconomic and ecological problems which
   hinder their sustainability. Marine environments were analyzed in view
   of their importance in sustaining the populations of the main commercial
   species during some stage of their life cycle, and which are susceptible
   to be affected by climatic variables. We addressed coral reefs, sea
   grasses, coastal lagoons, wetlands, sea currents, frontal systems and
   upwelling, based on the climatic scenarios generated by three general
   circulation models -ECHAM5/MPI, HADGEM1 and GFDL CM 2.0- as well as the
   scenarios of emissions A1B, A2 and B2 for the years 2030 and 2050.
   Impact of climate change in ecosystems and its effects on fisheries were
   examined, specifically with 16 of the main fisheries which constitute
   more than 70\% of the volume and commercial value of national fisheries.
   The impacts, around which we have to structure adaptation and mitigation
   strategies, are: increase in sea surface temperature, sea level rise,
   and the change of precipitation patterns which will affect the volume of
   river flow.},

Abstract = {The management of renewable natural resources has become a highly
   sophisticated activity and, in western industrialized countries, natural
   resources management and policy are `scientific'. Yet, the precise role
   of science in the public policy process is unclear. In this paper we
   explore the role of scientists and scientific information in the
   development of resource management policy. As examples we analyze the
   way that scientific information was used in the initiation, design and
   implementation of the Puget Sound Water Quality Authority in Washington
   State and the Fraser River Estuary Management Program in British
   Columbia. Our analysis suggests that science enters into the policy
   process in an episodic way, having its greatest influence early in
   policy development. We contrast this `episodic' model of science in
   resource management policy with two alternative models in which science
   plays only a `general enlightenment' function and in which science is
   engaged throughout the policy process. We conclude that, in
   environmental and natural resource management, an adaptive approach in
   which policy initiatives are treated as `experiments' would be more
   effective than the episodic approach.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {A recent concern in marine robotics is to consider the deployment of
   fleets of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface
   vehicles (ASVs). Multiple vehicles with heterogeneous capabilities have
   several advantages over a single vehicle system, and in particular the
   potential to accomplish tasks faster and better than a single vehicle.
   This paper addresses in this context the problem of underwater targets
   localization. A systematic and exhaustive coverage strategy is not
   efficient in terms of exploration time: it can be improved by making the
   AUVs share their information to cooperate, and optimize their motions
   according to the state of their knowledge on the target localization. We
   present techniques to build environment representations on the basis of
   which adaptive exploration strategies can be defined, and define an
   architecture that allows information sharing and cooperation between the
   AUVs. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the proposed architecture
   and the adaptive exploration strategies.},

Title = {Compound climate risks threaten aquatic food system benefits},
Journal = {NATURE FOOD},

Volume = {2},
Number = {9},
Pages = {673+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The nutritional, economic and livelihood contributions provided by
   aquatic food systems are threatened by climate change. Building climate
   resilience requires systemic interventions that reduce social
   vulnerabilities.
   Aquatic foods from marine and freshwater systems are critical to the
   nutrition, health, livelihoods, economies and cultures of billions of
   people worldwide, but climate-related hazards may compromise their
   ability to provide these benefits. Here, we estimate national-level
   aquatic food system climate risk using an integrative food systems
   approach that connects climate hazards impacting marine and freshwater
   capture fisheries and aquaculture to their contributions to sustainable
   food system outcomes. We show that without mitigation, climate hazards
   pose high risks to nutritional, social, economic and environmental
   outcomes worldwide-especially for wild-capture fisheries in Africa,
   South and Southeast Asia, and Small Island Developing States. For
   countries projected to experience compound climate risks, reducing
   societal vulnerabilities can lower climate risk by margins similar to
   meeting Paris Agreement mitigation targets. System-level interventions
   addressing dimensions such as governance, gender equity and poverty are
   needed to enhance aquatic and terrestrial food system resilience and
   provide investments with large co-benefits towards meeting the
   Sustainable Development Goals.},

Title = {Litter Windrows in the South-East Coast of the Bay of Biscay: An Ocean
   Process Enabling Effective Active Fishing for Litter},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Large scale convergence regions of floating marine litter are commonly
   observed in semi-enclosed seas as the Bay of Biscay. However, clean-up
   activities on such accumulation regions are limited by the spread of the
   large-size floating litter on the sea surface. Data gathered by a
   small-scale fishing vessel devoted to active fishing for floating litter
   activities during the spring and summer of 2018 reveals that the linear
   streaks of high concentration of floating litter (so-called litter
   ``windrows{''}) are common accumulation structures in the south-east
   coast of the Bay of Biscay. The random search of litter windrows for
   their collection through surface tows of macro-nets was proved to be an
   effective action for floating litter mitigation. A total of 196 tows
   collected 16.2 tons of floating marine litter in 68 working days. Most
   of the litter windrows were around 1 km length and, on average,
   accumulated 77.75 kg of floating marine litter. Fishing, shipping and
   aquaculture sectors were the source of 35\% of the 4,130 litter items
   analyzed (55\% in weight of the sourced items), and plastic was the most
   common type of material (96\% in terms of items). A better understanding
   of the phenomenon of the litter windrows, capable to guide clean-up
   efforts in space and time, would provide a considerable improvement in
   the efficiency of mitigation actions to reduce the marine litter
   pollution. The observations of litter windrows in the coastal area of
   the south-east of the Bay of Biscay demonstrate the key role of
   submesoscale processes in the distribution of FML. The present work
   provides a thorough description of floating litter windrows in nature,
   which it was non-existent to date. The results are the kind of proof
   necessary to boost the research addressed on the submesoscale
   aggregations of FML. Coupling litter windrows observations with
   remote-sensing technology and high-resolution modeling techniques offer
   great opportunities for the mitigation actions against marine litter.},

   MethodsWe developed and evaluated correlative bioclimatic models for an
   Australian mire ecosystem by: (1) selecting environmental predictors
   representing ecological processes that mediate ecosystem occurrence and
   dynamics; (2) using a high-performance modelling algorithm; (3)
   quantifying predictive performance by cross-validation; (4)
   cross-checking responses to predictor variables between different
   algorithms; (5) comparing the modelled responses with expected
   mechanistic responses; (6) evaluating extrapolation risks by quantifying
   the deviation between future and current environmental domains of the
   study area and by assessing the temporal constancy of correlations
   between variables; (7) using a geographically stratified
   cross-validation to verify spatial consistency of the model; and (8)
   quantifying the robustness of predictions of climate change impacts to
   uncertainty in both climate and ecological models.
   ResultsAll combinations of global circulation models and distribution
   model projected declines of at least 30\% in both area and suitability
   of environments for the mire ecosystem and in projecting a contraction
   of range to the southwest. We identified a likely refuge in the south of
   the distribution and two less certain, emerging areas of suitable
   environment west and south of the current distribution.
   Main ConclusionsWe conclude that southern mire ecosystems are highly
   susceptible to climate change. Our approach will be useful for the
   prediction of climate impacts on other ecosystems for which there is
   enough knowledge to map distributions and develop plausible hypotheses
   about environmental factors that influence them.},

Abstract = {As cities warm and the need for climate adaptation strategies increases,
   a more detailed understanding of the cooling effects of land cover
   across a continuum of spatial scales will be necessary to guide
   management decisions. We asked how tree canopy cover and impervious
   surface cover interact to influence daytime and nighttime summer air
   temperature, and how effects vary with the spatial scale at which
   land-cover data are analyzed (10-, 30-, 60-, and 90-m radii). A
   bicycle-mounted measurement system was used to sample air temperature
   every 5 m along 10 transects (similar to 7 km length, sampled 3-12 times
   each) spanning a range of impervious and tree canopy cover (0-100\%,
   each) in a midsized city in the Upper Midwest United States. Variability
   in daytime air temperature within the urban landscape averaged 3.5
   degrees C (range, 1.1-5.7 degrees C). Temperature decreased nonlinearly
   with increasing canopy cover, with the greatest cooling when canopy
   cover exceeded 40\%. The magnitude of daytime cooling also increased
   with spatial scale and was greatest at the size of a typical city block
   (60-90 m). Daytime air temperature increased linearly with increasing
   impervious cover, but the magnitude of warming was less than the cooling
   associated with increased canopy cover. Variation in nighttime air
   temperature averaged 2.1 degrees C (range, 1.2-3.0 degrees C), and
   temperature increased with impervious surface. Effects of canopy were
   limited at night; thus, reduction of impervious surfaces remains
   critical for reducing nighttime urban heat. Results suggest strategies
   for managing urban land-cover patterns to enhance resilience of cities
   to climate warming.},

Abstract = {The 3rd International Symposium on the Effects of Climate Change on the
   World's Oceans was held in Santos, Brazil, in March 2015, convened by
   the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the
   North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), and the
   Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC), and
   organized locally by the Oceanographic Institute, University of Sao
   Paulo (IO-USP). The symposium was designed to do two things. First, to
   get updates on new scientific developments that would address recognized
   uncertainties that remained from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report and to contribute to building
   bridges between research in the natural and social sciences in respect
   to the human dimensions of climate change, with a focus on coastal
   communities, management objectives, governance and adaptation measures.
   The choice of the venue in Santos, Brazil, was aimed to stimulate and
   widen this thematic discussion in Latin America and southern Atlantic
   regions, where there still are important knowledge gaps and scientific,
   politic and societal challenges to be overcome. The meetingwas attended
   by 280 participants from 38 countries, contributing 336 oral and poster
   presentations. This paper summarizes the main outcomes of the symposium
   and introduces a number of papers submitted to this special issue.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of economic experiments run among
   fishermen from the Mexican and Colombian Pacific. The experimental
   design aims at studying behavior under uncertainty concerning the
   possible effects of climate change on fisheries. We find that subjects'
   risk-aversion diminishes the level of catches and changes fishing
   practices (e.g. adopting marine reserves), provided that fishermen have
   ex ante information on possible climatic consequences. Furthermore,
   social preferences (e.g. for cooperation and reciprocity) also play an
   important role regarding extraction from common-pool resources. Other
   factors, such as income, gender and religion are also found to have some
   influence. These results have important implications for adaptation
   actions and the management of coastal fisheries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Some European regions are experiencing unprecedented impacts due to
   climate change. The islands of the Outermost Regions are also being
   affected by this phenomenon. When these islands have a higher level of
   functional complexity, climate change increases the difficulty of
   defining their urban and regional planning tools. A comparative analysis
   of the characteristics of these islands (comparing land use and
   demographic density) and a review of the efficacy of planning tools for
   incorporating climate change adaptation has been developed in order to
   understand the transformations produced in the regulatory frameworks.
   Through the case studies of Gran Canaria (Spain) and Reunion Island
   (France), which show high levels of urban and peri-urban land use
   pressure, the paper focuses on analysing the degree of mainstreaming
   adaptation strategies, as key elements for land use planning in a
   context of climate change. Results show a dysfunction between adaptation
   needs and the incorporation of the climatic issue in land use
   management. Insular planning tools do not generally consider climate
   change adaptation and excessive top-down management is observed in the
   decision-making process. This paper contributes new case studies to the
   literature, comparing two non-sovereign European islands, and reviews
   the regulatory framework on adaptation in insular contexts related to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {In an era of ecological degradation, global climate change, demographic
   shifts and increasing intensity and frequency of natural hazards, the
   Pacific Islands including the State of Hawai'i face heightened risk.
   Human and environmental well-being are tightly coupled; thus,
   science-based solutions must marry place-based, culturally relevant
   processes that link disaster preparedness, relief and recovery with
   resilience theories and applications. However, these fields remain mired
   in epistemological silos, and the operationalization of these theories
   has been slow, particularly at the community level. This paper explores
   the challenges of bridging these intersecting fields and the application
   of theory to practice, through a community-based case study in Hanalei,
   Hawai'i. We deployed household surveys, key informant interviews and
   traditional talk-story sessions to gather baseline information on
   demographic and socio-ecological transformations, perceptions of risk
   and preparedness, and coping and adaptive capacity measures. Results
   showed that residents exhibit medium-to-high coping and adaptive
   capacities, while visitors present high vulnerability and dependence
   upon locals. Social resilience metrics highlight differential coping and
   adaptive capacities among households with varying characteristics (e.g.,
   sex of head of household, longevity of residence and household size)
   offering risk reduction targets. A gap analysis developed from a
   qualitative analysis of open-ended survey questions highlights key
   sectors, areas and populations with perceived gaps in preparedness and
   resilience, coupled with ideas for solutions centered around local
   capacity building and improved knowledge and awareness. Community-based
   assessments underpin the development of long-term disaster resilience
   planning initiatives and to addressing gaps in vulnerable sectors and
   populations.},

Title = {Impact of Urban Cool Island measures on outdoor climate and pedestrian

Abstract = {One of the first airmail services in the world, the Aeropostale, was
   located at the Montaudran airport of Toulouse, France. This landmark and
   its surroundings will be refurbished in the years to come and will be
   transformed into a mixed-use development, the Aerospace Campus, with
   residential buildings, and commercial, sports, educational and cultural
   facilities. This new district has been planned mostly on the basis of
   heritage and functional rules. The UCI project (from ``Urban Cool
   Islands{''}) is a French national research project that discusses
   procedures aiming at incorporating a set of reasoned measures for local
   climate adaptation into this new urban area that will be set as a
   landmark development. This research aims to analyse and compare various
   suitable, resilient urban design strategies to provide support for their
   application in the Montaudran district, focusing on mitigating urban
   heat island effects in summer conditions. Three main methodological
   steps were undertaken: (1) the initial urban plan was assessed relative
   to a set of well-known urban morphology parameters and a microclimate
   analysis; (2) a set of urban design variations was established based on
   important microclimate adaptation measures as well as on the constraints
   and opportunities of the original plan; (3) the microclimate was
   modelled and the thermal comfort of pedestrians analysed. Results
   pointed out the major influence of water and green features on the
   mitigation of urban heat islands, notably in daytime. Besides creating
   an important urban cool island for pedestrians, the results showed great
   opportunities for supporting decision makers on specific integrated
   actions towards a truly sustainable neighbourhood. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Climate adaptation and risk preparedness in Florida's East Coast cities:
   views of municipal leaders},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Cities along Florida's Atlantic coastline are particularly vulnerable to
   the effects of climate change, posing significant challenges for city
   planners. How cities see themselves in terms of developing or
   implementing their climate change adaptation action plans depends, in
   part, on the extent to which they perceive climate-related events as
   risks, and their city size. Data were obtained from city leaders (i.e.
   mayors, city/town managers, or their designees) from 86 cities along
   Florida's Atlantic Coast from January to May 2021 to quantitatively
   assess factors influencing city adaptation planning. Validity and
   reliability were obtained for the survey. Multiple regression analyses
   showed significant positive correlations between perceived risk, city
   size, and (self-assessed) climate change preparedness. A statistical
   interaction was noted; as city size increased, risk perception
   decreased.},

Title = {Collaborative decision-analytic framework to maximize resilience of
   tidal marshes to climate change},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Decision makers that are responsible for stewardship of natural
   resources face many challenges, which are complicated by uncertainty
   about impacts from climate change, expanding human development, and
   intensifying land uses. A systematic process for evaluating the social
   and ecological risks, trade-offs, and cobenefits associated with future
   changes is critical to maximize resilience and conserve ecosystem
   services. This is particularly true in coastal areas where human
   populations and landscape conversion are increasing, and where
   intensifying storms and sea-level rise pose unprecedented threats to
   coastal ecosystems. We applied collaborative decision analysis with a
   diverse team of stakeholders who preserve, manage, or restore tidal
   marshes across the San Francisco Bay estuary, California, USA, as a case
   study. Specifically, we followed a structured decision-making approach,
   and we using expert judgment developed alternative management strategies
   to increase the capacity and adaptability to manage tidal marsh
   resilience while considering uncertainties through 2050. Because
   sea-level rise projections are relatively confident to 2050, we focused
   on uncertainties regarding intensity and frequency of storms and
   funding. Elicitation methods allowed us to make predictions in the
   absence of fully compatible models and to assess short- and long-term
   trade-offs. Specifically we addressed two questions. (1) Can
   collaborative decision analysis lead to consensus among a diverse set of
   decision makers responsible for environmental stewardship and faced with
   uncertainties about climate change, funding, and stakeholder values? (2)
   What is an optimal strategy for the conservation of tidal marshes, and
   what strategy is robust to the aforementioned uncertainties? We found
   that when taking this approach, consensus was reached among the
   stakeholders about the best management strategies to maintain tidal
   marsh integrity. A Bayesian decision network revealed that a strategy
   considering sea-level rise and storms explicitly in wetland restoration
   planning and designs was optimal, and it was robust to uncertainties
   about management effectiveness and budgets. We found that strategies
   that avoided explicitly accounting for future climate change had the
   lowest expected performance based on input from the team. Our
   decision-analytic framework is sufficiently general to offer an
   adaptable template, which can be modified for use in other areas that
   include a diverse and engaged stakeholder group.},

Abstract = {This review paper attempts to summarize the scattered and fragmented
   knowledge about past and possible future changing storm-surge statistics
   using the particularly well-studied case of the North Sea as an example.
   For this region, a complete and robust analysis methodology has been
   developed in recent years. This methodology is based on dynamical and
   statistical models. Using the concept of dynamical downscaling,
   development during recent decades, when sufficiently good and
   homogeneous weather data exist, has been ``reconstructed,'' and
   scenarios of possible future change are described. ``Localization''
   allows estimation of changes at specific sites, e. g., harbors. As local
   water-level statistics depend not only on climate variations but also on
   local modifications of the local bathymetry, new options for adaptation
   emerge. For the case of Hamburg, an option for such future adaptations
   is discussed.},

   Analysis-Based Three-Dimensional Sequential Monitoring Network Design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {A three-dimensional compliance monitoring network design methodology is
   presented to develop an adaptive and sequentially modified management
   policy that intends to improve optimal and justifiable use of
   groundwater resources in coastal aquifers. In the first step, an
   ensemble metamodel-based multiobjective prescriptive model is developed
   using a coupled simulation-optimization approach to derive a set of
   Pareto optimal groundwater extraction strategies. Prediction uncertainty
   of metamodels is addressed by utilizing a weighted average ensemble
   using set pair analysis. In the second step, a monitoring network is
   designed for evaluating the compliance of the implemented strategies
   with the prescribed management goals due to possible uncertainties
   associated with field-scale application of the proposed management
   policy. Optimal monitoring locations are obtained by maximizing
   Shannon's entropy between the saltwater concentrations at the selected
   potential locations. Performance of the proposed three-dimensional
   sequential compliance monitoring network design is assessed for an
   illustrative multilayered coastal aquifer study area. The performance
   evaluations show that sequential improvements of optimal management
   strategy is possible by using saltwater concentrations measured at the
   proposed optimal compliance monitoring locations. Therefore, the
   salinity concentration data collected at the designed compliance
   monitoring wells can be used to collect feedback information in terms of
   salinity concentrations. This feedback information can be applied to
   improve the initially prescribed optimal groundwater extraction patterns
   while keeping the original management goal intact.},

Abstract = {Governments and resource managers have generally accepted the importance
   of active and effective management of aquatic resources. This has lead
   many governments to adopt policies of sustainable ecosystem-based
   resource management within their jurisdictions, which has motivated the
   development of a diverse range of scientific tools. One of the tools
   being utilised is the ecosystem model Atlantis (Fulton and Smith 2004).
   This paper describes the development and application of Atlantis as a
   tool for exploring scenarios (e.g. changing climate) and evaluating
   management strategies for achieving conservation goals or sustainable
   use of natural resources (e.g. spatial zoning).
   Atlantis is a whole-of-ecosystem modelling framework that allows
   multiple alternative submodels to be used to represent biophysical
   processes, relevant human activities, and adaptive management processes
   for regional marine ecosystems.
   While Atlantis has been applied to a significant number of continental
   shelf and offshore regional systems, coastal applications have been
   restricted to two major bays in Victoria (Port Phillip Bay and
   Westernport Bay). Our presentation will focus on progress in applying
   the model to a large estuarine system (see Figure 1), where freshwater
   and other inputs from a largely agricultural catchment play a key role
   in the dynamics.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise due to climate change is a major threat to coastal
   ecosystems worldwide. Current management to reduce beach erosion often
   focuses on protecting human structures and research on effects on
   wildlife is lacking. Using a combination of hierarchical models and
   generalized linear models, we evaluated how the gopher tortoise
   (Gopherus polyphemus) colonized constructed dunes along coastal scrub at
   the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, central Florida, USA. Over
   2 years, we surveyed tortoise populations along natural dunes and 2
   constructed dunes (completed in 2012 and in 2014) and estimated tortoise
   density each summer and winter. Our models indicated that tortoise
   density along the 2014 dune was comparable to that of natural dunes ((x)
   over bar = 0-8 tortoises/ha), and density peaked at a mean of 21
   tortoises/ha along the 2012 constructed dune. Gopher tortoises rapidly
   colonized constructed dunes, and dune construction may represent
   effective management against habitat loss for this species. (C) 2017 The

Title = {Assessing how ecosystem-based adaptations to climate change influence
   community wellbeing: a Vanuatu case study},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change poses significant threats to wellbeing and livelihoods of
   people and the ecosystems in many Small Island Developing States (SIDS).
   Adaptation solutions must counteract these threats while also supporting
   development in vulnerable SIDS. Suitable options need to ensure that
   connections between the social, economic, and environmental dimensions
   of socio-economic systems are defined in a way that can support how
   decisions are made (and by whom) and how these can impact on other parts
   of these systems. This is particularly important in many Pacific SIDS,
   where communities practise customary natural resource management and
   continue to rely on local natural resources. In this study, we model the
   anticipated impacts of climate change and the benefits of the
   ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches on community wellbeing in
   Vanuatu. To do this, we applied participatory and expert elicitation
   methods to develop a Bayesian network model, which was designed to
   evaluate community wellbeing responses at four explicit spatial scales.
   The model includes both acute and chronic impacts of climate change, the
   impact of coral bleaching, and the potential loss of Vanuatu's fringing
   coral reefs. The model predicts that all proposed EbA interventions will
   have a positive impact on wellbeing in all four locations to some
   degree, by either directly improving the integrity of Vanuatu's
   ecosystems or by protecting these ecosystems as a positive spill-over of
   related actions. Significantly, it also predicts that if climate change
   exceeds 1.5 degrees C of warming, the costs of achieving the same level
   of wellbeing are increased.},

Title = {Flood legislation and land policy framework of EU and non-EU countries
   in Southern Europe},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Floods are a widespread natural hazard affecting people and their assets
   in regions worldwide, including Southern Europe. Besides coastal floods,
   the Mediterranean region is highly prone to flash floods driven by short
   but intense precipitation events. With increasing flood risk due to
   climate change and socio-economic conditions, governments are under
   pressure to reinforce flood protection measures, which could be a great
   challenge for the weak economies of non-EU developing countries. This is
   of particular relevance to achieving international commitments such as
   the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Several policy
   frameworks have been developed to mitigate flooding risk, at European
   Union (EU) and global level. These frameworks call for a holistic risk
   reduction approach where governments, institutions, and households are
   all responsible for reducing risk. In practice, however, gray
   infrastructure remains the prevailing flood risk management measure in
   many countries. Incorporation into national legislation and
   implementation of the EU policy framework will increase constraints and
   pressures for non-EU countries, particularly those strongly committed to
   becoming EU members in future. This article provides a comprehensive
   review of policies and measures implemented in four different southern
   European countries to mitigate flood hazard, and compares governance
   aspects between EU (Portugal and Slovenia) and non-EU countries (B\&H
   and Serbia). Understanding governance aspects and the status of
   flood-related policy implementation is of critical importance in
   protecting people and enhancing resilience to climate change impacts.
   Programs of improvement measures and further integration of sustainable
   water management with other sectoral policies are required to reduce
   flood risks.

Title = {California coastal management with a changing climate},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {45-73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With over 2,000 miles (3,218 km) of ocean and estuarine coastline,
   California faces significant coastal management challenges as a result
   of climate change-induced sea level rise. Under high emission scenarios,
   recent models predict 1.4 m or more of sea level rise by 2100,
   accompanied by increasing storm surges. This article investigates the
   most important issues facing coastal managers, explores the policy tools
   available for adapting to the impacts of climate change, assesses
   institutional constraints to adaptation, and identifies priorities for
   future research and policy action. We find that adaptation tools exist
   for dealing with anticipated increases in coastal erosion and flooding,
   but they involve significant costs and tradeoffs. In particular, coastal
   armoring, such as seawalls, can protect developed coastal lands, but
   destroys beaches and habitat. Although California already has policies
   and institutions that aim to balance the competing objectives for
   coastal development, management agencies are at the early stages of
   understanding how to facilitate adaptation. Research priorities to
   inform coastal adaptation planning include: (i) inventorying coastal
   resources to provide a firmer basis for balancing decisions on property
   and habitat protection, (ii) identifying opportunities for coastal
   habitat migration, (iii) assessing the vulnerabilities of existing and
   planned coastal infrastructure, and (iv) experimenting with alternatives
   to armoring as a way of managing the changing coastline.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Maintaining coral reef ecosystems is a social imperative, because so
   many people depend on coral reefs for food production, shoreline
   protection, and livelihoods. The survival of reefs this century,
   however, is threatened by the mounting effects of climate change.
   Climate mitigation is the foremost and essential action to prevent coral
   reef ecosystem collapse. Without it, reefs will become extremely
   diminished within the next 20-30 years. Even with strong climate
   mitigation, however, existing conservation measures such as marine
   protected areas and fisheries management are no longer sufficient to
   sustain the ecosystem and many additional and innovative actions to
   increase reef resilience must also be taken. In this paper we assess the
   suite of protections and actions in terms of their potential to be
   effective according to a set of criteria that include effectiveness,
   readiness, cobenefits and disbenefits. Even with the best scientific
   innovation, saving coral reefs will require a well-funded,
   well-designed, and rapidly executed strategy with political and social
   commitments at the level of other grand challenges.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change and extreme weather events (e.g. frost-,
   heat-, drought-, and heavy rainfall events) on the continuous
   phenological development over the entire seasonal cycle remained poorly
   understood. Previous studies mainly focused on modeling key phenological
   transition dates (e.g. discrete timing of spring bud-break and fall
   senescence) based on aggregated climate variables (e.g. mean
   temperature, growing-degree days). We developed and evaluated a Bayesian
   Hierarchical Space-Time model for Land Surface Phenology (BHST-LSP) to
   synthesize remotely sensed vegetation greenness with climate covariates
   at a daily temporal scale from 1981 to 2014 across the entire
   conterminous United States. The BHST-LSP model incorporated both
   temporal and spatial information and exhibited high predictive power in
   simulating daily phenological development with an overall out-of-sample
   R-2 of 0.80 +/- 0.17 and 0.72 +/- 0.20 for spring and fall phenology,
   respectively. The overall out-of-sample normalized root mean square
   errors were 9.3\% +/- 6.1\% and 9.9\% +/- 5.2\% between the observed and
   predicted vegetation greenness for spring and fall phenology,
   respectively. We found that a fast increase of temperature can
   accelerate the speed of spring green-up while a slow decrease of
   temperature can lead to a decelerated fall brown-down. Increasing
   accumulated precipitation can benefit daily phenological development
   over an entire growing season, while extreme rainfall events can have
   the opposite effects. More frequent frost events could slow spring leaf
   expansion and accelerate fall leaf senescence. Impacts of extreme heat
   events were complex and depended on water availability. Cropland in the
   Midwest as well as evergreen needleleaf forest along the coastal regions
   showed relatively strong resistance to drought events compared to other
   land cover types. The BHST-LSP model can be used to forecast vegetation
   phenology given future climate projection, thus providing valuable
   information for adopting climate change adaptation and mitigation
   measures.},

Abstract = {Globally, it is smaller urban settlements that are growing most rapidly,
   are most constrained in terms of adaptive capacity but increasingly
   looked to for delivering local urban resilience. Data from three smaller
   coastal cities and their wider regional governance systems in Florida,
   US; West Sussex, UK and Sao Paulo, Brazil are used to compare the
   influence of scale and sector on city adaptive capacity. These tensions
   are described through the lens of the Adaptive Capacity Index (ACI)
   approach. The ACI is built from structuration theory and presents an
   alternative to social-ecological systems framing of analysis on
   adaptation. Structuration articulates the interaction of agency and
   structure and the intervening role played by institutions on information
   flow, in shaping adaptive capacity and outcomes. The ACI approach
   reveals inequalities in adaptive capacity to be greater across scale
   than across government, private and civil society sector capacity in
   each study area. This has implications for adaptation research both by
   reinforcing the importance of scale and demonstrating the utility of
   structuration theory as a framework for understanding the social
   dynamics underpinning adaptive capacity; and policy relevance, in
   particular considering the redistribution of decision-making power
   across scale and/or compensatory mechanisms, especially for lower scale
   actors, who increasingly carry the costs for enacting resilience
   planning in cities. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Uncertainty and Future Planning: The Use of Scenario Planning for
   Climate Change Adaptation Planning and Decision},
Booktitle = {COMMUNICATING CLIMATE CHANGE INFORMATION FOR DECISION-MAKING},
Series = {Springer Climate},
Year = {2018},
Pages = {79-90},
Abstract = {This chapter reports on lessons on the use of scenario planning for
   informing long-term climate change adaptation planning and decision.
   Lessons are extracted based on the development and application of
   exploratory scenarios (multiple plausible futures) involving two
   different levels of stakeholder engagement in Australia: (i) a
   regional/institutional and (ii) a community level. Lessons from the
   regional/institutional level focus on the South East Queensland Climate
   Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQCARI) involving a multi-sectoral
   investigation of climate change adaptation in the South East Queensland
   (SEQ) region, comprising the sectors of urban and regional planning,
   coastal management, physical infrastructure, emergency management, and
   human health. Lessons from the community level are drawn from the
   recovery phase of the Cardwell town in far north Queensland in the
   aftermath of category five Tropical Cyclone Yasi. Findings indicate that
   at the regional/institutional level exploratory scenarios are useful to
   support the integration of different stakeholders' and sectors'
   perspectives concerning climate change adaptation. In particular, they
   provide opportunities for improved understanding of sector-specific as
   well as cross-sectoral issues to be addressed. At the community level,
   exploratory scenarios assist in the scoping of specific and tailored
   adaptation options. However, a limited number of options accounts for
   multi-dimensional challenges and longer-term future planning related to
   climate change impacts.},

   (101 from a mid-size predominantly White midwestern state university and
   102 from an HBCU located on the East Coast). Perceived stress, minority
   status stress, and coping behaviors were measured. Multivariate
   comparisons revealed that African American students on the PWCU campus
   experienced higher levels of minority status stressors compared to their
   counterparts at the HBCU. Participants from both universities were
   generally similar in their use of coping strategies and in their levels
   Of overall perceived stress. An exploratory model and an alternate model
   of stress and coping processes were tested. Both models highlight the

Abstract = {Not only are humans responsible for the anthropogenic causes of
   currently observed climate change, but we are also responsible for our
   responses to climate change. How we choose to respond provides important
   insights into our ability to collectively act in the face of threats
   with the unique characteristics of climate change. This communication
   attempts to provide an overview of some of the difficulties in forging
   new policy directions along our coastlines in an era of climate change.
   It is meant as a referential framing for the research presented in this
   Special Issue. As this communication is being written, the world is
   gripped by a global pandemic caused by a variant of the coronavirus.
   There are important corollaries between the underlying characteristics
   of the coronavirus and the causes and effects of climate change. Seeing
   how the global citizenry is responding to the current epidemic provides
   some insight into the difficulties in fostering collective action
   towards climate change. As with the pandemic, the issue is not really
   one of understanding the problem, but rather the varying human responses
   to the problem. We can expect the same difficulties as we continue to
   confront the ever-growing problem of climate change.},

Title = {Discriminated perceptions of climatic impacts on coastal farm management
   practices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Agriculture is responsive to weather and climate variability. In
   addition to the climatic stressors, coastal agriculture is influenced by
   non-climatic factors. Therefore, understanding farmers' perception of
   the causes of their changes in farm management plays a key role in
   motivating them to adopt agricultural adaptations. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the changes in coastal farm management in Bangladesh
   over the last decade compared to the previous one. We explored whether
   the causes of those changes were climatic or non-climatic as perceived
   by the farmers and the factors that shaped their perceptions. We
   interviewed 381 farmers sampled from ten subdistricts along the coast of
   Bangladesh. Descriptive statistics showed that the farmers had changed
   on average 10 to 11 farm management practices. Though the average value
   was 67\%, a higher number of farmers in the western coastal zone
   mentioned that climate change had impacts on their farm management.
   Adoption of rice crop-related adaptations was greater than livestock,
   fisheries or general agricultural practices. According to the
   discriminant function analysis, discriminative variables were perception
   of climatic impacts on farm productivity, climate change awareness,
   involvement with non-farm jobs, age, education, organizational
   affiliation, number of changed farm practices, and meteorologically
   consistent perception of rainfall and temperature. Lessons learned from
   this research are that the farmers should better understand the link
   between climate change and farm management practices while motivating
   them to implement adaptation strategies. This could be achieved by
   improving farmers' climate change awareness, perceptions of changes in
   climatic parameters and involvement with farm-related associations.},

Title = {Compound Vulnerabilities: The Intersection of Climate Variability and
   HIV/AIDS in Northwestern Tanzania},
Journal = {WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Nsisha, a rural village
   located close to the shores of Lake Victoria in northwestern Tanzania,
   this article analyzes how climate change and variability intersect with
   other stressors that affect rural livelihoods, particularly HIV/AIDS.
   The analysis integrates theories of vulnerability from both climate and
   HIV/AIDS literatures to show how these intersecting stressors compound
   livelihood vulnerability in complex ways. Climate change and variability
   are linked to declining agricultural yields and an increase in food and
   nutrition insecurity and poor health in this region. This situation
   heightens poverty and susceptibility to HIV/AIDS, compromising people's
   abilities to cope and adapt. Because of social dynamics, single mothers
   and their children are particularly affected by these compound
   vulnerabilities. Climate change and variability are significant
   contributing vulnerability factors that sustain and exacerbate
   asymmetrical poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and HIV/AIDS. By
   describing the links between vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and climate
   variability, findings highlight the importance of holistic and localized
   approaches to adaptation, instead of trying to isolate single issues.
   Prioritization of multidisciplinary research focusing on the socially
   differentiated and gendered distribution of vulnerability specifically
   in regard to poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and HIV/AIDS is
   recommended as a means to enrich the understanding of climate change
   vulnerability. Adaptation strategies should address how climatic shifts
   interact with generalized poverty, food and nutrition insecurity,
   health, and gendered vulnerability in areas most affected.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses challenges and risks to coastal communities, and
   the adaptation of local residents is a critically relevant issue that
   needs to be addressed in the policymaking process. The main purpose of
   this paper is to determine the perceptions and experiences of climate
   change among coastal community residents in the Philippines. This study
   used a combination of methods, such as participatory mapping exercises,
   focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and document
   analyses. The data, which were primarily collected from three coastal
   villages in the province of Bulacan, were subjected to a thematic
   network analysis. The findings revealed four dominant themes pertaining
   to climate change adaptation in a coastal community setting:
   vulnerability conditions, risk awareness, risk perceptions, and climate
   change awareness and perceptions. In particular, it was found out that
   the communities were exposed to the threats of natural hazards like
   flood and storm surge. Such exposure highlighted the residents' concerns
   over the risks of hazards on their livelihoods and properties. The
   residents also observed the unpredictability and the worsening effects
   of climate change. With their direct experiences of the natural hazards'
   impacts and awareness of the presence of risks, residents had undertaken
   actions to build their adaptive capacity. This study then highlights the
   value of integrating local knowledge into the mapping exercises,
   revealing crucial information regarding vulnerabilities, risks, and
   adaptation practices.},

Abstract = {The economics of adaptation to climate change relies heavily on
   comparisons of the benefits and costs of adaptation options that can
   range from changes in policy to implementing specific projects. Since
   these benefits are derived from damages avoided by any such adaptation,
   they are critically dependent on the specification of a baseline. The
   current exercise paper reinforces this point in an environment that
   superimposes stochastic coastal storm events on two alternative sea
   level rise scenarios from two different baselines: one assumes perfect
   economic efficiency of the sort that could be supported by the
   availability of actuarially fair insurance and a second in which
   fundamental market imperfections significantly impair society's ability
   to spread risk. We show that the value of adaptation can be expressed in
   terms of differences in expected outcomes damages only if the effected
   community has access to efficient risk-spreading mechanisms or reflects
   risk neutrality in its decision-making structure. Otherwise, the
   appropriate metric for measuring the benefits of adaptation must be
   derived from certainty equivalents. In these cases, increases in
   decision-makers' aversion to risk increase the economic value of
   adaptations that reduce expected damages and diminish the variance of
   their inter-annual variability. For engineering and other adaptations
   that involve significant up-front expense followed by ongoing
   operational cost, increases in decision-makers' aversion increase the
   value of adaptation and therefore move the date of economically
   efficient implementation closer to the present.},

Abstract = {Globally, climate change has caused changes in frequency and intensity
   of climate extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and tropical
   cyclones. There is a need to understand the pattern of regional climate
   extremes to develop crucial adaptation strategies for the farming
   community. This paper focuses on developing the Expert Team on Climate
   Risk and Sector-specific Indices for rainfall, relevant for the
   agriculture and food security sector. The indices have been developed
   for Lower Vellar River sub-basin, a coastal basin in Tamil Nadu, India.
   Trend analysis has been done for the climatic and cropping seasons in
   the sub-basin. Overall, there has not been any trend in the annual
   rainfall index values. The monthly trend values for the different
   indices have mostly exhibited insignificant trends throughout the study
   period (1978-2015) except for a few indices. Overall, the southwest
   monsoon season has shown a significantly decreasing trend in the
   indices. The northeast monsoon season has shown insignificant trends
   with positive slopes for most indices. There were insignificant or no
   trends in the indices for the summer season. The findings from the study
   can be used as a guiding tool for developing adaptation strategies, for
   the farming community.},

Volume = {690},
Pages = {1310-1320},

Abstract = {Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, along with readily
   available remote sensing datasets and the outputs of land-surface and
   climate models, are used to monitor spatiotemporal variabilities in the
   groundwater resources of the Red Sea Coastal Aquifer (RSCA) system in
   Saudi Arabia; to investigate their responses to climate projections; and
   to provide sustainable and resilient management scenarios for these
   resources. Our results indicate that, during the investigated period
   (April 2002-June 2017), the RSCA received an average annual recharge of
   3.16 +/- 0.52 km(3). Recharge events (similar to 16\% of rainfall) are
   related to the observed increase in rainfall rates. Analysis of climate
   models' outputs over the RSCA indicates an increase in the median annual
   rainfall (17-31\%) and recharge rates (2.7-4.9\%) by the end of the 21st
   century. To ensure sustainable management and utilization of RSCA's
   water resources, groundwater extraction should be located in the
   southern and central parts of the aquifer, and groundwater extraction
   rates should be kept lower than 2.0 km(3)/yr. Findings highlight the
   importance of GRACE data as a unique, cost-effective, and decisive tool
   in monitoring the health of coastal and inland aquifer systems across
   the globe. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change is disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities,
   increasing existing risks and leading to further global inequalities.
   Drawing on the concept of urban adaptation justice, we evaluated the
   inclusion of vulnerable communities in the climate change adaptation
   planning process of ?Istanbul, a European coastal megacity with
   considerable vulnerability to climate change. For this, a policy content
   analysis structured around four criteria: (i) participation, (ii)
   capacity enhancement, (iii) governance, and (iv) justice integration
   into spatial planning, was carried out and supplemented by local expert
   consultations. Our findings indicate that while the objective of
   incorporating some aspects of justice in adaptation planning was
   recognized, there was a distinct lack of specific actions or evaluation
   tools. The expert consultations largely confirmed these findings, which
   were then connected to the socio-historical and political context of
   ?Istanbul and the wider Turkish region. Key con-clusions include the
   failure of current adaptation policies to adequately consider
   vulnerabilities arising from a combination of urban marginalization
   interacting with neoliberal authoritarianism. We identify the need for
   understanding and integrating equitable climate change adaptation as a
   key dimension of urban decision-making for future policy-relevant
   research and practice},

Pages = {211-227},
Abstract = {This work analyses projections of agricultural impacts obtained with an
   ensemble of 10 regional climate models (RCMs) from the European project
   PRUDENCE, applied to yields of winter and summer crops. Projections were
   evaluated for 12 sites of the Iberian Peninsula for the 2071-2100
   period, taking 1961-1990 as the control period or baseline. Future
   prospects for agriculture require quantifying the variability and
   discrepancy between results obtained from the modelling chain RCMs-crop
   models, i.e. the climate-impact ensemble, as well as the possible
   benefits drawn from the adaptation strategies of agriculture to the new
   climate conditions. Consistency within the climate-impact ensemble
   members was assessed by ranking comparisons of both projected yield
   impacts and yield changes. Adaptation strategies were simulated for
   cropping options having low uncertainty projections of yield decrease,
   as was the case for fully irrigated maize. The consistency between the
   10 RCMs per crop and site was classified as generally moderate.
   Consistency among RCMs was greater both in rainfed and irrigated farming
   of winter cereals in N-plateau, NE-Valley, NW-Inland, Centre and NE, and
   very low in maize in the NW-Coast for example. RCM inconsistencies are a
   source of uncertainty in predicting climate change (CC) impacts on
   agriculture. Ranking comparisons of yield changes among different sites
   and cropping options gave even lower ensemble consistency, which shows
   the difficulty in projecting yield changes resulting from CC.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity plays a key role for our planet by buffering ongoing and
   future changes in environmental conditions. We tested if canopy-forming
   algae enhancing biodiversity (CEB) in a Mediterranean intertidal reef
   ecological community could alleviate the effect of stressors (heat waves
   and pollution from sewage) on community metabolic rates (as expressed by
   oxygen consumption) used as a proxy of community functioning. CEB
   exerted a buffering effect related to the properties of stressor:
   physical-pulsing (heat wave) and chronic-trophic (sewage). After a
   simulated heat wave, CEB was effective in buffering the impacts of
   detrimental temperatures on the functioning of the community. In reefs
   exposed to chronic sewage effluents, benefits derived from CEB were less
   evident, which is likely due to the stressor's contextual action. The
   results support the hypothesis that ecological responses depend on
   stressor typology acting at local level and provide insights for
   improving management measures to mitigate anthropogenic disturbance.},

Title = {A Community-based Approach to Mainstream Human-Nature Interactions into
   Coastal Risk Governance: A case of Katrenikona, India},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coastal rural communities, being intricately associated with their
   ecological settings, are often highly vulnerable to climate change.
   Amongst the many approaches of reducing the coastal vulnerabilities and
   achieving climate change adaptation, a potential solution is to improve
   risk governance through integrated coastal zone management. The coastal
   risk governance signifies not only the actions of the state but also of
   other stakeholders, especially the local communities. Community-based
   approaches have also for long been advocated for effective adaptation
   and mitigation against climate adversities. While human-nature
   interactions can significantly influence disaster risks, this research
   makes an attempt to understand various decisions and choices that a
   coastal rural community makes based on such interactions to mitigate and
   manage the climate-induced adversities. Through structured interviews,
   this research first identifies the significant domains that reflect on
   the prevailing human-nature interactions, after which the choice
   modelling technique is utilized to comprehend the community priorities
   for better climate risk governance, with a specific focus on coastal
   rural settlements of Katrenikona (Andhra Pradesh, India). The
   application of this methodology resulted in the formulation of a
   baseline for local coastal governance, which can be useful for informing
   various levels within local governments. The baseline consists of an
   assessment of the different community resilience domains derived based
   on the prevailing interactions of local communities with their
   surrounding ecological elements and measured by indicators of local
   coastal governance. The concept and method for measuring coastal risk
   governance based on community preferences are potentially replicable,
   and it can help to track the progress towards longer-term coastal
   management and local climate adaptation goals. At the same time, it can
   be turned into a self-evaluation tool to assist the local governments in
   reflecting on pertinent pathways involving community actions for
   effectively managing various climate risks and ecological impacts.},

Title = {Modeling O-18 as an early indicator of regime shift arising from
   salinity stress in coastal vegetation},
Journal = {HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1257-1276},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In many important coastal habitats, a combination of increasing soil
   salinization due to sea level rise, reduced precipitation and storm
   surges may induce regime shift from salinity-intolerant glycophytic
   vegetation to salinity-tolerant halophytic species. Early detection of
   regime shift due to salinity stress in vegetation may facilitate
   conservation efforts. It has been shown that the O-18 value of water in
   the xylem of trees can be used as a surrogate for salinity in the
   rooting zone of plants. Coupling measured O-18 values in the tree xylem
   with simulated O-18 values in trees and salinity in the vadose zone can
   be used to investigate competitive responses of glycophytic versus
   halophytic trees. MANTRA-O18 simulations suggest that the impacts of
   salinization on diminishing the resilience of salinity-intolerant trees
   can be detected up to 25years before the glycophytic trees are
   threatened with regime shift to halophytic species. This early detection
   provides critical lead time and valuable information and insights useful
   for planning adaptation strategy to mitigate against the adverse impacts
   of sea level rise and climate change.},

Title = {The evolution of aquatic agricultural systems in Southwest Bangladesh in
   response to salinity and other drivers of change},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-207},
Abstract = {Aquatic agricultural systems (AAS) in coastal Southwest Bangladesh have
   evolved in response to a number of stimuli and constraints including
   improving market access, technological change, and salinization. Farming
   systems in the region are highly dynamic, and are characterized by the
   integration of varying combinations of freshwater prawns, rice, fish,
   vegetables, and brackish water shrimp. This paper examines the
   developmental history, productivity, and profitability of three distinct
   AAS: a low-salinity freshwater prawn-dominated system; an
   intermediate-salinity-mixed prawn and shrimp system, and a high-salinity
   shrimp-dominated system. Productivity, cropping intensity, and
   profitability are found to be highest in the diversified low-and
   intermediate-salinity systems, and lower in the high-salinity system,
   where cultivation of rice and vegetables is no longer possible. The
   paper concludes that more diverse integrated systems reduce risk and
   vulnerability for farming households. Salinization is found to be a
   double-edged sword - proving a stimulus to diversification at low
   levels, but reducing agro-biodiversity at higher salt concentrations.
   While the adaptation strategies in all systems have been successful in
   maintaining or improving most, though not all, system functions due to
   high levels of social resilience, support for effective community-based
   adaptation strategies will enable continued transformation and
   adaptation to future drivers of change.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Due to the severe effect of urban heat island (UHI), the street
   geometries, including the orientation and aspect ratio, exert certain
   impacts on urban microclimates and outdoor thermal comfort. Designing
   sustainable cities requires a holistic approach. The objective of this
   study is to investigate how the canyon aspect ratio and orientation
   affect the street microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort in central
   business districts under the local climate of Nanjing city. To achieve
   this goal, a series of numerical simulations were conducted based on a
   total of 64 urban scenarios with various canyon aspect ratios and
   orientations. The microclimate simulation results for different urban
   models were used to predict the outdoor thermal comfort, which was
   evaluated with the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) index. The
   PET results indicate a certain correlation between canyon geometries and
   outdoor thermal comfort. Finally, several suggestions were proposed for
   urban planners and designers to implement mitigation strategies and
   methods to alleviate extreme heat stress, and toward the sustainable
   development of the contemporary cities.},

Title = {An evidence-based approach for setting desired state in a complex Great
   Barrier Reef seagrass ecosystem: A case study from Cleveland Bay},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Implementing management actions to achieve environmental outcomes
   requires defining and quantifying ecological targets, but this is a
   complex challenge, and there are few examples of how to quantitatively
   set them in complex dynamic marine ecosystems. Here we develop a
   methodology to devise `desired state' for tropical seagrasses in
   Cleveland Bay, northern Australia, in the Great Barrier Reef World
   Heritage Area. Analysis of diverse species assemblages was used to
   define seagrass communities as indicators of the region's ecological
   value. Multivariate regression trees assigned 8000 observations of
   species presence/absence and habitat characteristics from 2007 to 2017
   into seven community types. Generalized Linear Models were used to
   assess annual variation in above-ground biomass of each seagrass
   community. Reference subsets of the data expressing high biomass and
   spatial extent were identified, and desired state was defined as the
   mean and 95\% confidence intervals. This approach rests on the
   assumption that seagrass resilience and its ecosystem services are ma
   when the diverse seagrass communities reach desired state. This method
   required a data set that spanned a range in seagrass conditions, but
   which may have been compromised by a history of pressures. Our method
   for defining desired state provides evidence-based targets that can be
   used within an adaptive management framework that prioritises and
   implements management actions.},

Abstract = {As climate change unfolds, formal planning for climate adaptation is
   emerging at all levels of governments. This paper examines the factors
   that lead U.S. state governments to develop comprehensive adaptation
   plans. Using an event history analysis, we find that a state is more
   likely to engage in adaptation planning we find that a state is more
   likely to engage in adaptation planning when it experienced more extreme
   weather events recently, has more economic activities in coastal
   regions, or when it has high levels of incomes and civic engagement. We
   also show that political ideology plays a critical role in subnational
   adaptation decision making. A state is less likely to pursue adaptation
   planning when it has a Republican governor or has a lack of preference
   for environmental legislations. In addition to the internal
   characteristics, our study further provides evidence of the external
   influence from other nearby adapting states through spatial policy
   diffusion. These findings shed light on the motivation for and obstacles
   to a state's adoption of adaptation policy and also provide implications
   for environmental federalism.},

Title = {The economic vulnerability of fishing households to climate change in
   the south Pacific region of Colombia},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change's direct and indirect effects on marine ecosystems and
   coastal areas mainly impact small-scale fishers, especially in
   developing countries, which present extreme poverty and high dependency
   on marine ecosystems as a source of food and sustenance for households.
   Understanding the vulnerability of fishing households and considering
   the associated socio-economic-political complexities is essential for
   preserving their livelihoods and maintaining their well-being. This
   study proposes a measure of economic vulnerability based on the capacity
   of fishing households in Tumaco, located on the southern Pacific coast
   of Colombia, to diversify their livelihoods. Different statistical
   procedures have been conducted to identify the most relevant strategies
   in reducing the economic vulnerability of households. The results
   indicate that reducing the vulnerability of fishing households depends
   on adaptation strategies such as occupational mobility, some elements of
   social capital, and reduced dependence on the fisheries resource. This
   study could constitute an input for creating public policy that guides
   efforts to achieve strategies for the generation of other livelihoods
   and the sustainability of fishing households that continue to choose
   fishing as their main economic activity.},

Title = {Application of system approach framework for coastal zone management in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {931-942},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Due to changes in atmospheric circulation and warmer winters, the
   frequency of strong westerly storms associated with high sea level in
   ice-free sea conditions has increased on the western coast of Estonia.
   This trend is especially dangerous for the sections of depositional
   seashores along the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea such as Parnu Bay
   and its surroundings. Parnu is the largest city in SW Estonia being a
   popular summer resort with excellent sandy beaches and relevant
   infrastructure for tourism. Extreme events that may occur in the Parnu
   Bay region are irregular extensive floods and sea ice attacks but also
   strong erosion of beaches. During the last 50 years, the city has
   suffered from two remarkably high storm surges and associated
   inundations. The aim of the paper was to analyze the best solutions for
   coastal zone management in Parnu Bay area using a System Approach
   Framework (SAF). It is based on some new results of geomorphic surveys
   performed in the study area in 2015-2017, review of previous work as
   well as results from stakeholder meetings. Some formerly proposed flood
   defence projects and ideas were re-analyzed and new ideas were proposed
   to better inform the people about risks and reduce the damage in case of
   catastrophic events. Based on the analysis of the collected data and
   discussions with the stakeholders, we concluded that hard coastal
   protection measures would be too expensive and therefore not reasonable
   for implementation. Developing different kinds of adaptation measures
   and raising awareness of the people are the most applicable response
   options to high storm surges and extensive inundations in the Parnu Bay
   region.},

Title = {Salinity and food security in southwest coastal Bangladesh: impacts on
   household food production and strategies for adaptation},
Journal = {FOOD SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {229-248},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rising salinity of land and water is an important, but understudied,
   climate change-sensitive trend that can exert devastating impacts on
   food security. This mixed methods investigation combines salinity
   testing with qualitative research methods to explore these impacts in
   one of the most salinity-affected regions in the world-the Ganges River
   Delta. Data collection in 2015 and 2016 undertaken in Bangladesh's
   southwest coastal region and Dhaka consisted of 83 in-depth household
   and stakeholder interviews, six community focus groups, and salinity
   testing of 27 soil and 45 surface and groundwater samples. Results show
   that household food production is a multifaceted cornerstone of rural
   livelihood in the southwest coastal region, and virtually every
   component of it-from rice plantation and homestead gardening to
   livestock cultivation and aquaculture-is being negatively affected by
   salinity. Although households have attempted multiple strategies for
   adapting food production, effective adaptation remains elusive. At the
   community level, improved irrigation and floodplain management, as well
   as restrictions on saltwater aquaculture to abate salinity, are viewed
   as promising interventions. However, the potential of such measures
   remains unrealized on a broad scale, as they require a level of external
   resources and regulation not yet provided by the NGO and government
   sectors. This study elucidates issues of accessibility, equity, and
   governance surrounding agricultural interventions for climate
   change-related salinity adaptation, and its findings can help inform the
   community of organizations that will increasingly need to grapple with
   salinity in order to guarantee food security in the context of
   environmental change.},

Title = {A framework to assess national level vulnerability from the perspective
   of food security: The case of coral reef fisheries},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {95-108},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Measuring the vulnerability of human populations to environmental change
   is increasingly being used to develop appropriate adaptation policies
   and management plans for different economic sectors. We developed a
   national-level vulnerability index that is specific to food security
   policies by measuring nations' relative vulnerabilities to a decline in
   their coral reef fisheries. Coral reef fisheries are expected to decline
   with climate and anthropogenic disturbances, which may have significant
   consequences for food security. The vulnerability measure was composed
   of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indicators specific to
   fisheries, reef management, and food security. The vulnerability index
   was used to evaluate 27 countries, as data required to fully populate
   the theoretical framework was limited. Of these, Indonesia and Liberia
   were identified as most and Malaysia and Sri Lanka as least vulnerable
   nations. Our analysis revealed two common national vulnerability
   characterizations: low income countries with low adaptive capacity and
   middle-income countries with higher adaptive capacity but high
   sensitivity. These results suggest developing context-specific policies
   and actions to build adaptive capacity in the low-income countries, and
   to decrease sensitivity in middle-income countries. Comparing our food
   security evaluation to a more general vulnerability approach shows that
   they produce different priority countries and associated policies.

Title = {Harvest control rules used in US federal fisheries management and
   implications for climate resilience},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Abstract = {Climate change is altering the productivity of marine fisheries and
   challenging the effectiveness of historical fisheries management.
   Harvest control rules, which describe the process for determining catch
   limits in fisheries, represent one pathway for promoting climate
   resilience. In the USA, flexibility in how regional management councils
   specify harvest control rules has spawned diverse approaches for
   reducing catch limits to precautionarily buffer against scientific and
   management uncertainty, some of which may be more or less resilient to
   climate change. Here, we synthesize the control rules used to manage all
   507 US federally managed fish stocks and stock complexes. We classified
   these rules into seven typologies: (1) catch-based; (2) constant catch;
   (3) constant escapement; (4) constant F; (5) stepped F; (6) ramped F and
   (7) both stepped and ramped F. We also recorded whether the control
   rules included a biomass limit ('cut-off') value or were environmentally
   linked as well as the type and size of the buffers used to protect
   against scientific and/or management uncertainty. Finally, we review the
   advantages and disadvantages of each typology for managing fisheries
   under climate change and provide seven recommendations for updating
   harvest control rules to improve the resilience of US federally managed
   fisheries to climate change.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather events brought about by climate change have caused
   devastating impacts on communities in many parts of the world; affecting
   people's lives and infrastructure in an unprecedented manner. Extreme
   weather events are the most prominent risk facing humanity and 2017 was
   the most costly hurricane season on record. As extreme weather events
   increase in both intensity and frequency it is critical that preemptive
   solutions to mitigate disasters are found. Nowhere is this more true
   than in the Philippines where 62\% of the country's population lives in
   coastal zones. The scale of devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013
   revealed a high degree of vulnerability among coastal and small island
   communities in a region regularly hit by tropical cyclones. The
   situation is expected to worsen with more frequent extreme events
   compounded by sea level rise. Conservation International (CI) in
   collaboration with Bechtel Corporation's Building Resilient Communities
   Program is piloting a new approach for coastal protection at two sites
   in the province of Iloilo, Philippines. The project integrates
   ecological solutions with engineering structures, providing green-gray
   infrastructure to alleviate the impact of extreme weather events. By
   blending green and gray techniques the environment becomes more
   adaptable and resilient than either technique applied alone. The concept
   designs, planned for implementation in 2019, use civil engineering
   techniques to establish and support the rehabilitation of mangrove
   communities. The long-term benefits of rehabilitating coastal mangrove
   forests in the region will mitigate climate change impacts and support
   community adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {The Pacific Islands region has made strong progress on the integration
   of climate change, disaster management and development frameworks,
   particularly via the Pacific Urban Agenda and the Framework for
   Resilient Development in the Pacific. These frameworks highlight the
   need for local-level collaboration in achieving ambitious pathways for
   climate- and disaster-resilient development. However, to date little
   research has investigated the role that local-level collaboration plays
   in implementation. Additionally, there is a lack of guidance on how to
   design and implement local-level collaboration that is informed by
   in-country practitioner experiences. This study addresses those gaps.
   Its findings indicate that in the Pacific collaborative attributes span
   individuals, institutions, collaborative arrangements, and broader
   governance systems. They also suggest that the skills needed to
   undertake collaboration well at the local level are, in part, already
   manifest in Pacific cultures as invisible skill sets. More can be done
   to make the invisible visible by documenting and developing the `soft
   skills' that are necessary to achieve climate- and disaster-resilient
   development. This action could contribute to bridging the gap between
   ambition and reality.},

Abstract = {Lake Urmia (Urumieh in Persian) in north-western Iran is one of the
   largest permanent hyper-saline lakes in the world and the largest lake
   in the Middle East. It has numerous ecological, economic and social
   implications in terms of biodiversity, climate, species, habitat,
   tourism and recreation. However, during the past decade, the lake has
   shrunk significantly and its depth has fallen by almost 6m. Contrary to
   other studies that have focused on the geomorphology of the lake, this
   study analyses the socio-environmental impact and provides a sustainable
   adaptive governance management model for its revival. This study reveals
   that unless various stakeholders and affected parties are actively
   involved in an implementable adaptive governance model, the fate of the
   lake will remain uncertain.},

Title = {Vietnam Climate Change and Health Vulnerability and Adaptation
   Assessment, 2018},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Climate Risk Index 2020 ranked Vietnam as the
   sixth country in the world most affected by climate variability and
   extreme weather events over the period 1999-2018. Sea level rise and
   extreme weather events are projected to be more severe in coming
   decades, which, without additional action, will increase the number of
   people at risk of climate-sensitive diseases, challenging the health
   system. This article summaries the results of a health vulnerability and
   adaptation (V\&A) assessment conducted in Vietnam as evidences for
   development of the National Climate Change Health Adaptation Plan to
   2030.
   METHODS: The assessment followed the first 4 steps outlined in the World
   Health Organization's Guidelines in conducting ``Vulnerability and
   Adaptation Assessments.{''} A framework and list of indicators were
   developed for semi-quantitative assessment for the period 2013 to 2017.
   Three sets of indicators were selected to assess the level of (1)
   exposure to climate change and extreme weather events. (2) health
   sensitivity, and (3) adaptation capacity. The indicators were rated and
   analyzed using a scoring system from 1 to 5.
   RESULTS: The results showed that climate-sensitive diseases were common,
   including dengue fever, diarrheal, influenza, etc, with large burdens of
   disease that are projected to increase. From 2013 to 2017. the level of
   ``exposure{''} to climate change-related hazards of the health sector
   was ``high' to ``very high,' with an average score from 3.5 to 4.4 (out
   of 5.0). For ``health sensitivity,{''} the scores decreased from 3.8 in
   2013 to 3.5 in 2017, making the overall rating as ``high.{''} For
   `adaptive capacity,{''} the scores were from 4.0 to 4.1, which meant
   adaptive capacity was ``very low.{''} The overall V\&A rating in 2013
   was ``very high risk{''} (score 4.1) and ``high risk{''} with scores of
   3.8 in 2014 and 3.7 in 2015 to 2017.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adaptation actions of the health sector are urgently needed
   to reduce the vulnerability to climate change in coming decades. Eight
   adaptation solutions, among recommendations of V\&A assessment, were
   adopted in the National Health Climate Change Adaptation Plan.},

Abstract = {Climate change effects on marine ecosystems include impacts on primary
   production, ocean temperature, species distributions, and abundance at
   local to global scales. These changes will significantly alter marine
   ecosystem structure and function with associated socio-economic impacts
   on ecosystem services, marine fisheries, and fishery-dependent
   societies. Yet how these changes may play out among ocean basins over
   the 21st century remains unclear, with most projections coming from
   single ecosystem models that do not adequately capture the range of
   model uncertainty. We address this by using six marine ecosystem models
   within the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project
   (Fish-MIP) to analyze responses of marine animal biomass in all major
   ocean basins to contrasting climate change scenarios. Under a high
   emissions scenario (RCP8.5), total marine animal biomass declined by an
   ensemble mean of 15\%-30\% (+/- 12\%-17\%) in the North and South
   Atlantic and Pacific, and the Indian Ocean by 2100, whereas polar ocean
   basins experienced a 20\%-80\% (+/- 35\%-200\%) increase. Uncertainty
   and model disagreement were greatest in the Arctic and smallest in the
   South Pacific Ocean. Projected changes were reduced under a low (RCP2.6)
   emissions scenario. Under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, biomass projections were
   highly correlated with changes in net primary production and negatively
   correlated with projected sea surface temperature increases across all
   ocean basins except the polar oceans. Ecosystem structure was projected
   to shift as animal biomass concentrated in different size-classes across
   ocean basins and emissions scenarios. We highlight that climate change
   mitigation measures could moderate the impacts on marine animal biomass
   by reducing biomass declines in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean
   basins. The range of individual model projections emphasizes the
   importance of using an ensemble approach in assessing uncertainty of
   future change.},

   Coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The adverse impacts of climate change exert mounting pressure on
   agriculture-dependent livelihoods of many developing and developed
   nations. However, integrated and spatially specific vulnerability
   assessments in less-developed countries like Bangladesh are rare, and
   insufficient to support the decision-making needed for climate-change
   resilience. Here, we develop an agricultural livelihood vulnerability
   index (ALVI) and an integrated approach, allowing for (i) mapping out
   the hot spots of vulnerability distribution; (ii) identifying key
   factors of spatially heterogeneous vulnerability; and (iii) supporting
   intervention planning for adaptation. This study conceptualized
   vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
   capacity by developing a composite index from a reliable dataset of 64
   indicators comprising biophysical, agro-ecological, and socioeconomic
   variables. The empirical studies of coastal Bangladesh revealed that
   Bhola, Patuakhali, and Lakshmipur districts, around the mouth of the
   deltaic Meghna estuaries, are the hot spot of vulnerability
   distribution. Furthermore, the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability was
   triggered by spatial variation of erosion, cyclones, drought, rain-fed
   agriculture, land degradation, soil phosphorus, crop productivity,
   sanitation and housing condition, infant mortality, emergency shelters,
   adoption of agro-technology. The integrated approach could be useful for
   monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation intervention
   by substituting various hypothetical scenarios into the ALVI framework
   for baseline comparison.},

Abstract = {The ``Trento City MicroClimate Changes Research Project{''} is a master
   dissertation that seeks to define urban strategies capable of mitigating
   the urban heat island (UHI) of Trento. The aim of the dissertation is
   the reuse of existing spaces and surfaces of the city to regenerate them
   and make them more comfortable. The project uses climatological data to
   set the basis of an urban planning based on the knowledge of
   vulnerabilities and opportunities related to the UHI effect. The
   mitigation process is based on the green infrastructure approach, since
   it reaches several ecosystem services related to ecology, social life
   and economy and it has the highest cost-benefit ratio. Moreover, the
   proposed solutions involve strategies that make cities resilient to
   climate change effects. The project also seeks to define how to
   implement such strategies in the urban planning. In fact, the definition
   of guidelines for a mitigation plan at the urban scale, providing the
   devices and defining the actors involved, is completed by zooming in on
   a pilot neighbourhood to test the efficiency of the mitigation devices
   in the urban environment like roads, open spaces and buildings. UHI
   mitigation is an opportunity to rethink the city in its structure, in
   order to develop it into a more sustainable manner by increasing
   environmental and social quality parameters for its inhabitants. The
   project defines a clear vision and common goals for the future of
   Trento, which are necessary to implement the tactics and to trace a
   framework through which future transformations of the city can be
   evaluated.},

Abstract = {For decades, botanists have recognized that rare plants are clustered
   into ecological ``islands{''}: small and isolated habitat patches
   produced by landscape features such as sinkholes and bedrock outcrops.
   Insular ecosystems often provide unusually stressful microhabitats for
   plant growth (due, for example, to their characteristically thin soils,
   high temperatures, extreme pH, or limited nutrients) to which rare
   species are specially adapted. Climate-driven changes to these stressors
   may undermine the competitive advantage of stress-adapted species,
   allowing them to be displaced by competitors, or may overwhelm their
   coping strategies altogether. Special features of insular ecosystems -
   such as extreme habitat fragmentation and association with unusual
   landscape features - could also affect their climate sensitivity and
   adaptive capacity. To help predict and manage climate-change impacts, I
   present a simple conceptual framework based on a synthesis of over 300
   site-level studies. Using this framework, conservation efforts can
   leverage existing ecological knowledge to anticipate habitat changes and
   design targeted strategies for conserving rare species.},

Abstract = {The application of metamodelling frameworks is a popular approach to
   handle the computational cost arising from complex computer simulations
   and global optimization algorithms in simulation-optimization routines.
   In this paper, Radial Basis Functions (RBF) are used as metamodels for
   the computationally expensive variable-density flow and salt transport
   numerical simulations, in a pumping optimization problem of coastal
   aquifers. While RBF metamodels have been fairly utilized in many
   engineering optimization problems, their use is very limited in coastal
   aquifer management. Two adaptive metamodelling frameworks are employed,
   that is, the adaptive-recursive approach and the metamodel-embedded
   evolution strategy. In both frameworks, cubic RBF models are used to
   approximate the constraint functions imposed on the coastal aquifer
   pumping optimization problem. The optimal pumping rates are first
   calculated based on the variable-density and salt transport numerical
   models of seawater intrusion. The resulting optimal solutions and the
   computational times are set as benchmark values in order to assess the
   performance of the metamodelling optimization strategies. Results
   indicate that the metamodel-embedded evolution framework outperformed in
   terms of computational efficiency the adaptive-recursive approach while
   it successfully located the region of the global optimum. Furthermore,
   with the metamodel-embedded evolution strategy the computational time of
   the variable-density-based optimization was reduced by 96 \%.},

Title = {Impacts of Natural Disasters on Subjective Vulnerability to Climate
   Change: A Study of Puerto Rican Fishers' Perceptions after Hurricanes

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {48},

Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Investigating people's levels of subjective vulnerability to change can
   help elucidate important aspects of adaptive capacity to impacts. This
   is particularly relevant in coastal communities with high exposure to
   natural disasters, such as those in the Caribbean region, especially
   given projections of increased frequency and severity of storms as a
   consequence of climate change. In this study, Puerto Rican fishers'
   perceptions of the effects of climate change on their fishing activity
   were compared before and after two major hurricanes severely impacted
   the island in the fall of 2017. Data was collected through the use of
   surveys conducted in 12 different fishing communities in Puerto Rico at
   two different time periods: pre-storms (August 2016 - January 2017) (N =
   212) and post-storms (May - June 2018) (N = 75). Results show that
   fishers demonstrated higher concern in the post-storms period for
   climate change in general as well as for other environmental changes
   attributed to climate change, particularly the impacts of storms and
   increased air temperature. Our analyses also investigate factors
   influencing fishers' concerns about climate change. Comparisons between
   fishers' perceptions in the pre- and post-storms periods allow for an
   increased understanding of the impacts of extreme events on fishers'
   subjective vulnerability to climate change and other environmental
   transformations. These changes in perception are likely to influence
   fishers' future adaptative behavior and they provide opportunities for
   the implementation of collaborative strategies to increase awareness of
   climate change impacts and develop strategies to maximize climate change
   resilience in fishing communities.},

Title = {Economics of climate change adaptation at the local scale under

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {This paper describes the design and application of a benefit-cost model
   to the city of Durban's (South Africa) climate change adaptation
   options. The approach addresses the inability to compile an accurate
   damage-cost function for economic prioritizations at the local level. It
   proposes that uncertainty over climate impacts and the efficacy of
   adaptation responses, in conjunction with the lack of economic data,
   high levels of economic informality and inequality make it difficult to
   link adaptation efforts to positive GDP impact in Durban. Instead, the
   research based its calculations of ``benefits{''} on the number of
   people impacted and the extent of the welfare benefits imparted by the
   respective adaptation efforts. It also took into account the uncertainty
   over future events, capacity constraints, priorities of decision makers
   and the risk of maladaptation. The results were reported as benefit-cost
   ratios for 16 clusters of interventions (many of which were primarily
   the responsibility of one municipal department or agency) in each of
   four future scenarios (defined by minor or major climate change and weak
   or strong socio-institutional capacity). The paper presents and
   discusses the benefit-cost ratios and total benefits for each of the
   intervention clusters in each of the future scenarios. It emphasizes how
   these are influenced by choices of time frames. It also highlights how
   the most efficient interventions across all futures and time frames tend
   to be socio-institutional - for instance the creation of a
   cross-sectoral disaster management forum, sea level rise preparedness
   and early warning system, and creating climate change adaptation
   capacity within the water services unit. Ecosystem-based adaptation
   measures had moderate benefit-cost ratios, probably because in Durban
   the land that needs to be purchased for this is relatively expensive.
   Infrastructure-based clusters generally had the lowest benefit-cost
   ratios.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of global climate-driven changes, marine ecosystems are
   experiencing polewards redistributions of species - or range shifts -
   across taxa and throughout latitudes worldwide. Research on these range
   shifts largely focuses on understanding and predicting changes in the
   distribution of individual species. The ecological effects of marine
   range shifts on ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as human
   coastal communities, can be large, yet remain difficult to anticipate
   and manage. Here, we use qualitative modelling of system feedback to
   understand the cumulative impacts of multiple species shifts in
   south-eastern Australia, a global hotspot for ocean warming. We identify
   range-shifting species that can induce trophic cascades and affect
   ecosystem dynamics and productivity, and evaluate the potential
   effectiveness of alternative management interventions to mitigate these
   impacts. Our results suggest that the negative ecological impacts of
   multiple simultaneous range shifts generally add up. Thus, implementing
   whole-of-ecosystem management strategies and regular monitoring of
   range-shifting species of ecological concern are necessary to
   effectively intervene against undesirable consequences of marine range
   shifts at the regional scale. Our study illustrates how modelling system
   feedback with only limited qualitative information about ecosystem
   structure and range-shifting species can predict ecological consequences
   of multiple co-occurring range shifts, guide ecosystem-based adaptation
   to climate change and help prioritise future research and monitoring.},

Title = {Resilience-oriented operation of power systems: Hierarchical
   partitioning-based approach},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {312},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {As an achievement of innovations resulting from partitioning mechanisms,
   these mechanisms can contribute to the more flexible operation of power
   systems in local communities. The ever-increasing frequency and severity
   of unexpected real-time failures have created challenges for
   partitioned-based power system operators, affecting each partition's
   resiliency. With this in mind, this paper presents an adaptive local
   operation strategy (ALOS) for resilient scheduling of the
   renewable-dominated partitioned-based power systems under normal and
   islanding modes in a decentralized manner. The main objective of the
   developed ALOS lies in reaching an affordable preparedness level in each
   partition to deal with unscheduled islanding mode, which can occur
   subsequent to real-time failures at common lines between adjacent
   partitions on transmission level. To this end, a set of
   resilience-target constraints is presented to prepare sufficient
   spinning reserve capacity in each partition to ensure continuity of
   supply during islanding mode. The proposed strategy is formulated as a
   two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and the nested
   formation algorithm is employed to execute it in a hierarchical fashion
   based on the privacy-preserving protocols. Besides, the tri-state
   compressed air energy storage (CAES) system is also included in the
   proposed strategy to mitigate the negative consequences caused by
   real-time failures and uncertain sources. Numerical results conducted on
   the IEEE 30-bus test system reveal that the proposed ALOS can enhance
   the resilience of each partition in responding to unscheduled islanding
   mode by efficiently utilizing all available capacities on the generation
   side. Furthermore, the DIgSILENT PowerFactory is used to identify the
   worst possible series of events and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   proposed resilience-promoting proactive strategy in dealing with these
   events.},

Title = {Estimating China's Population over 21st Century: Spatially Explicit
   Scenarios Consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Accurate and reliable subnational and spatially explicit population
   projections under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) for China will be
   helpful for understanding long-term demographic changes and formulating
   targeted mitigation and adaptation policies under climate change. In
   this study, national and provincial populations for China by age, sex,
   and education level to 2100 under five SSPs were estimated using the
   population-development-environment model. These parameters include
   fertility, mortality, migration, and education and consider the most
   recent birth policy in China. To quantify these projections spatially,
   the gridded population was provided at 1 km x 1 km by spatial
   downscaling. Results show the national population is highest under SSP3,
   with 1.71 x 10(9) people in 2100. Guangdong, Henan, and Shandong are the
   most populous in SSP1, 2, 4, 5, while Guangxi is the most populous
   province in SSP3, reaching 1.54 x 10(8) people. The differences in
   education level among scenarios are obvious, especially in 2100 where
   education level for SSP1 and SSP5 is the highest. The spatial
   distribution of population varies across the country, with the majority
   of the population concentrated in southern and eastern China, especially
   in the coastal regions. Our results under different SSPs could provide a
   reference to project disaster risks, formulate relevant policies and
   guide sustainable development from a long-term perspective.},

Title = {Evaluating the climate and air quality impacts of short-lived pollutants},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},

Pages = {10529-10566},
Abstract = {This paper presents a summary of the work done within the European
   Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ECLIPSE (Evaluating the
   Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants). ECLIPSE had
   a unique systematic concept for designing a realistic and effective
   mitigation scenario for short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs; methane,
   aerosols and ozone, and their precursor species) and quantifying its
   climate and air quality impacts, and this paper presents the results in
   the context of this overarching strategy. The first step in ECLIPSE was
   to create a new emission inventory based on current legislation (CLE)
   for the recent past and until 2050. Substantial progress compared to
   previous work was made by including previously unaccounted types of
   sources such as flaring of gas associated with oil production, and wick
   lamps. These emission data were used for present-day reference
   simulations with four advanced Earth system models (ESMs) and six
   chemistry transport models (CTMs). The model simulations were compared
   with a variety of ground-based and satellite observational data sets
   from Asia, Europe and the Arctic. It was found that the models still
   underestimate the measured seasonality of aerosols in the Arctic but to
   a lesser extent than in previous studies. Problems likely related to the
   emissions were identified for northern Russia and India, in particular.
   To estimate the climate impacts of SLCPs, ECLIPSE followed two paths of
   research: the first path calculated radiative forcing (RF) values for a
   large matrix of SLCP species emissions, for different seasons and
   regions independently. Based on these RF calculations, the Global
   Temperature change Potential metric for a time horizon of 20 years
   (GTP(20)) was calculated for each SLCP emission type. This climate
   metric was then used in an integrated assessment model to identify all
   emission mitigation measures with a beneficial air quality and
   short-term (20-year) climate impact. These measures together defined a
   SLCP mitigation (MIT) scenario. Compared to CLE, the MIT scenario would
   reduce global methane (CH4) and black carbon (BC) emissions by about 50
   and 80 \%, respectively. For CH4, measures on shale gas production,
   waste management and coal mines were most important. For non-CH4 SLCPs,
   elimination of high-emitting vehicles and wick lamps, as well as
   reducing emissions from gas flaring, coal and biomass stoves,
   agricultural waste, solvents and diesel engines were most important.
   These measures lead to large reductions in calculated surface
   concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. We estimate that in the
   EU, the loss of statistical life expectancy due to air pollution was 7.5
   months in 2010, which will be reduced to 5.2 months by 2030 in the CLE
   scenario. The MIT scenario would reduce this value by another 0.9 to 4.3
   months. Substantially larger reductions due to the mitigation are found
   for China (1.8 months) and India (11-12 months). The climate metrics
   cannot fully quantify the climate response. Therefore, a second research
   path was taken. Transient climate ensemble simulations with the four
   ESMs were run for the CLE and MIT scenarios, to determine the climate
   impacts of the mitigation. In these simulations, the CLE scenario
   resulted in a surface temperature increase of 0.70 +/- 0.14 K between
   the years 2006 and 2050. For the decade 2041-2050, the warming was
   reduced by 0.22 +/- 0.
   07 K in the MIT scenario, and this result was in almost exact agreement
   with the response calculated based on the emission metrics (reduced
   warming of 0.22 +/- 0.09 K). The metrics calculations suggest that
   non-CH4 SLCPs contribute similar to 22 \% to this response and CH4 78
   \%. This could not be fully confirmed by the transient simulations,
   which attributed about 90 \% of the temperature response to CH4
   reductions. Attribution of the observed temperature response to non-CH4
   SLCP emission reductions and BC specifically is hampered in the
   transient simulations by small forcing and co-emitted species of the
   emission basket chosen. Nevertheless, an important conclusion is that
   our mitigation basket as a whole would lead to clear benefits for both
   air quality and climate. The climate response from BC reductions in our
   study is smaller than reported previously, possibly because our study is
   one of the first to use fully coupled climate models, where unforced
   variability and sea ice responses cause relatively strong temperature
   fluctuations that may counteract (and, thus, mask) the impacts of small
   emission reductions. The temperature responses to the mitigation were
   generally stronger over the continents than over the oceans, and with a
   warming reduction of 0.44 K (0.39-0.49) K the largest over the Arctic.
   Our calculations suggest particularly beneficial climate responses in
   southern Europe, where surface warming was reduced by about 0.3 K and
   precipitation rates were increased by about 15 (6-21) mm yr(-1) (more
   than 4 \% of total precipitation) from spring to autumn. Thus, the
   mitigation could help to alleviate expected future drought and water
   shortages in the Mediterranean area. We also report other important
   results of the ECLIPSE project.},

Abstract = {Adaptive management of the marine environment requires an understanding
   of the complex interactions within it. Establishing levels of natural
   variability within and between marine ecosystems is a necessary
   prerequisite to this process and requires a monitoring programme which
   takes account of the issues of time, space and scale. In this paper, we
   argue that an ecosystem approach to managing the marine environment
   should take direct account of climate change indicators at a regional
   level if it is to cope with the unprecedented change expected as a
   result of human impacts on the earth climate system. We discuss the
   purpose of environmental monitoring and the importance of maintaining
   long-term time series. Recommendations are made on the use of these data
   in conjunction with modern extrapolation and integration tools (e.g.
   ecosystem models, remote sensing) to provide a diagnostic approach to
   the management of marine ecosystems, based on adaptive indicators and
   dynamic baselines. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A transdisciplinary framework proposal for surf break conservation and

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {197-211},

Abstract = {This paper combines the Social-Ecological System (SES), the Driving
   Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) and Adaptive Co-management
   frameworks to provide practical guidelines to address environmental
   issues facing surf breaks. We applied these frameworks to Bahia de Todos
   Santos World Surfing Reserve (BTSWSR), located in Ensenada, Baja
   California in northern Mexico. We gathered information through a
   literature review and a review of activities undertaken by the BTSWSR
   Local Stewardship Council (LSC) together with the local community
   (Ensenada town), regional and international environmental organizations,
   and government agencies. We also conducted participatory meetings with
   different stakeholders between 2014 and 2017. The SES framework provides
   the analytical perspective to have a better understanding of the
   multiple interactions among elements of the social and ecological
   systems to influence the opportunities for conservation strategies.
   DPSIR allows us to identify specific anthropogenic pressures threatening
   surf breaks within BTSWSR, their impact on the environment, and actual
   or possible responses to human activities, facilitating the development
   of an adaptive co-management plan. By combining these frameworks, we
   were able to describe the interactions between human and natural systems
   in BTSWSR, and we provide initial directions to improve the
   understanding of the anthropogenic activities affecting surf breaks, and
   targeted responses to address environmental impacts to the system. The
   surf break conservation and management framework presented in this paper
   is based on a transdisciplinary approach that emphases the need to
   address socio-environmental issues through openness to new forms of
   scientific and place-based knowledge.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) due to climate change will increase storm surge
   height along the 825 km long coastline of Metro Boston, USA. Land at
   risk consists of urban waterfront with piers and armoring, residential
   areas with and without seawalls and revetments, and undeveloped land
   with either rock coasts or gently sloping beachfront and low-lying
   coastal marshes. Risk-based analysis shows that the cumulative 100 year
   economic impacts on developed areas from increased storm surge flooding
   depend heavily upon the adaptation response, location, and estimated sea
   level rise. Generally it is found that it is advantageous to use
   expensive structural protection in areas that are highly developed and
   less structural approaches such as floodproofing and limiting or
   removing development in less developed or environmentally sensitive
   areas.},

Title = {Living with sea-level rise in North-West Europe: Science-policy
   challenges across scales},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) confronts coastal societies and stakeholders with
   increasing hazards and coastal risks with large uncertainties associated
   to these changes. Adaptation to SLR requires societal and policy
   decision-making to consider these changing risks, which are in turn
   defined by socio-economic development objectives and the local societal
   context. Here, we review some of the key challenges facing governments,
   stakeholders and scientists in adapting to SLR, and key aspects of
   successful adaptation, by exploring different approaches to SLR and
   coastal adaptation planning in three western European countries, the
   Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Several common challenges
   of SLR adaptation emerge across the different settings, including the
   inherent uncertainty regarding future conditions, the significant social
   and socioeconomic consequences, the consideration and distribution of
   (residual) risk over communities, and the long legacy of present-day
   decisions that affect future risk and management options supporting
   future generations. These challenges are addressed differently in the
   three countries, e. g. in the governance level at which adaptation is
   initiated, although common elements also emerge. One common emerging
   element is adaptive pathways planning, which entails dynamic
   decision-making that breaks uncertain decisions into manageable elements
   or steps over time, while keeping options for the future. Another common
   element is the development of effective local science-policy interfaces,
   as engagement of local decision-makers and citizens is essential to
   manage conflicting interests. Lastly, we find that social and
   communication sciences have great potential to support effective
   science-policy interfaces, e.g. though identifying societal tipping
   points. Yet, in decisions on SLR adaptation, insights from these fields
   are rarely used to date. We conclude that supporting science-policy
   interactions for adaptation decision-making at relevant (inter)national
   to local scales through tailored multi-disciplinary scientific
   assessments is an important way forward for SLR adaptation in Europe.},

Title = {Vulnerability of European freshwater catchments to climate change},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3567-3580},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to exacerbate the current threats to
   freshwater ecosystems, yet multifaceted studies on the potential impacts
   of climate change on freshwater biodiversity at scales that inform
   management planning are lacking. The aim of this study was to fill this
   void through the development of a novel framework for assessing climate
   change vulnerability tailored to freshwater ecosystems. The three
   dimensions of climate change vulnerability are as follows: (i) exposure
   to climate change, (ii) sensitivity to altered environmental conditions
   and (iii) resilience potential. Our vulnerability framework includes
   1685 freshwater species of plants, fishes, molluscs, odonates,
   amphibians, crayfish and turtles alongside key features within and
   between catchments, such as topography and connectivity. Several
   methodologies were used to combine these dimensions across a variety of
   future climate change models and scenarios. The resulting indices were
   overlaid to assess the vulnerability of European freshwater ecosystems
   at the catchment scale (18 783 catchments). The Balkan Lakes Ohrid and
   Prespa and Mediterranean islands emerge as most vulnerable to climate
   change. For the 2030s, we showed a consensus among the applied methods
   whereby up to 573 lake and river catchments are highly vulnerable to
   climate change. The anthropogenic disruption of hydrological habitat
   connectivity by dams is the major factor reducing climate change
   resilience. A gap analysis demonstrated that the current European
   protected area network covers <25\% of the most vulnerable catchments.
   Practical steps need to be taken to ensure the persistence of freshwater
   biodiversity under climate change. Priority should be placed on
   enhancing stakeholder cooperation at the major basin scale towards
   preventing further degradation of freshwater ecosystems and maintaining
   connectivity among catchments. The catchments identified as most
   vulnerable to climate change provide preliminary targets for development
   of climate change conservation management and mitigation strategies.},

   Economic Losses and Risk Reduction Options},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Access to a reliable water supply is central for a well-functioning
   society. However, water supply systems are subject to a wide range of
   threats which may affect their ability to provide water to society. This
   paper presents a novel risk assessment approach that enables thorough
   analyses of economic losses and associated uncertainties under a range
   of water supply disruption scenarios. The purpose is to avoid
   sub-optimization when prioritizing between risk reduction measures, by
   integrating the full range of possible outcomes from low to high
   probability events. By combining risk analysis with cost-benefit
   analysis, additional information is provided on measures for leveraging
   investments in managing and reducing the risks. This enables the
   identification of the most economically profitable risk reduction
   alternatives and enables decision makers to build strategic capacity for
   operating in difficult and uncertain futures. The presented approach is
   exemplified on the island of Gotland, one of the most water scarce areas
   of Sweden.},

Abstract = {In September 1994, a Workshop on Climate Change Implications and
   Adaptation Strategies for the Indo-Pacific Island Nations was held in
   Honolulu, Hawaii. The workshop was convened under the auspices of the US
   Country Studies Program and was designed to provide a forum for
   representatives of several Pacific Rim nations to discuss the
   implications of climate change for economic development and resource
   management in their jurisdictions. As a background to the workshop's
   deliberations, this article provides a survey of scientific
   understanding related to climate variability and change. In addition,
   the article identifies specific opportunities to use emerging
   information on climate variability and climate change to support
   environmentally sustainable economic development in the Pacific region.

Title = {A Framework for Cloud to Coast Adaptation: Maturity and Experiences from
   across the North Sea},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The low-lying coastal areas of the countries around the North Sea are
   exposed to flooding and the influence of sea level rise. The countries
   in the North Sea Region need to continue to adapt if the associated risk
   is to be well-managed into the future. In addition to reducing flood
   risk, adaptation measures can bring development opportunities for those
   same places. These opportunities, however, are unlikely to be achieved
   through a `defence only' paradigm, and instead a new approach is needed
   that simultaneously reduces risk and promotes liveable places, ecosystem
   health and social well-being. The building blocks of this new approach
   are promoted here and are based on an adaptation process that is
   collaborative and takes a whole-system, long-term perspective. The
   approach developed through the Interreg funded project, C5a, brings
   together governments, practitioners and researchers from across the
   North Sea to share policies, practices and the emerging science of
   climate change adaptation and enabling sustainable development. The new
   approach reflects a Cloud to Coast management paradigm and emerged
   through a combination of knowledge exchange and peer-to-peer learning
   across seven case studies. Central to the case studies was a maturity
   analysis of existing capabilities across the North Sea countries and
   their ability to adopt the new approach. This paper presents the results
   of this analysis, including the common challenges that emerged and the
   methods and examples of good practice to overcome them. Building upon
   these findings, the paper concludes by presenting four priority policy
   directions to support the uptake of the Cloud to Coast approach.},

Abstract = {Managing coastal flood risks involves selecting a portfolio of different
   strategies. Analyzing this choice typically requires a model.
   State-of-the-art coastal risk models provide detailed regional
   information, but they can be difficult to implement, computationally
   challenging, and potentially inaccessible. Simple economic damage models
   are more accessible but may not incorporate important features and thus
   fail to model risks and trade offs with enough fidelity to support
   decision making. Here, we develop a new framework to analyze coastal
   flood risk management. The framework is computationally inexpensive yet
   incorporates common features of many coastal cities. We apply this
   framework to an idealized coastal city and assess and optimize two
   objectives using combinations of risk mitigation strategies against a
   wide range of future states of the world. We find that optimization
   using combinations of strategies allows for identification of Pareto
   optimal strategy combinations that outperform individual strategy
   options.},

Title = {A Doubly-Fed Induction Generator Adaptive Control Strategy and
   Coordination Technology Compatible with Feeder Automation},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The extensive connection of distributed generation (DG) with the
   distribution network (DN) is one of the core features of a smart grid,
   but in case of a large number, it may result in problems concerning the
   DN-DG compatibility during fault isolation and service restoration, for
   which no efficient and economic solutions have been developed. This
   paper proposes a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) adaptive control
   strategy (ACS) and a coordination technology to be compatible with the
   typical feeder automation (FA) protection logics in the ring
   distribution system. First of all, an ACS simulating the inertia/damping
   characteristics and excitation principles of synchronous generators is
   developed to achieve seamless switching between DFIG
   grid-connection/island modes, and make distant synchronization possible.
   Next, a technology coordinating the DFIG islands controlled by ACS and
   the remote tie-switches based on local inspection of synchronization
   conditions for closing is developed to achieve the safety
   grid-connection of DFIG islands in the absence of DN-DG communication.
   At the last, a detailed simulation scenario with a ring DN accessed by
   five DFIGs is used to validate the effectiveness of ACS and coordination
   technology compatible with FA in various faults scenes.},

Abstract = {The impact of global warming on coastal areas, in terms of erosion,
   flooding and environmental change is a source of concerns for many
   peoples in the Pacific region. In New Caledonia, Ouvea atoll is one of
   the most vulnerable areas to sea level rise. The population strongly
   oriented towards his lagoon, is concerned about shoreline erosion and
   wants to build a climate change adaptation strategy. This paper presents
   a research-action device aimed to renforce people's resilience in the

   a coastline participatory monitoring as data acquisition instrument, and
   sharing ``inhabitants{''} and ``experts{''} knowledges, is the heart of
   the approach. The dissemination of information to the population is one
   of the aims.},

Title = {The codevelopment of coastal fisheries monitoring methods to support
   local management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries across the globe provide critical food security,
   livelihoods, and human well-being, but are threatened by a combination
   of local and global stressors, including overexploitation, pollution,
   and climate change. Participatory approaches to management, especially
   those that incorporate local communities and customary knowledge can
   provide meaningful biological information that supports sustainable
   fisheries management and builds local adaptive capacity to changing
   ocean conditions. Through a collaboration between fishers, scientists,
   NGOs, and regulating agencies, we developed a low-cost, low-tech method
   to assess the seasonal spawning peaks, lunar spawning cycles, and size
   at maturity (L-50) for key targeted reef fish, combining traditional
   knowledge and practice with modern scientific approaches, including
   gonadosomatic index (GSI) and histology. Two years of community-based
   monitoring resulted in data from 57 species and 15 families of reef and
   nearshore fishes (n = 2595), with detailed information for 10 species at
   4 locations across the Hawaiian Islands. Comparisons between
   community-collected GSI data and scientifically (histologically)
   assessed spawning cycles and size at reproductive maturity produced
   similar results suggesting that these approaches can be applied in
   data-poor fisheries to assess spawning seasons and size at maturity
   (L-50), both of which are critical needs for effective fisheries
   management. Semistructured surveys revealed a large body of local
   knowledge on spawning times and harvest practices based on allowing
   spawning to occur before harvesting and protecting small and large size
   classes, but little evidence that fishers understand temporal patterns
   of spawning. This suggests that monitoring methods that fill key gaps
   such as this and are congruent with these local knowledge systems and
   customary harvest practices may be key for local stewardship and
   adaptive management.},

Title = {An Efficient Anti-Interference Imaging Technology for Marine Radar},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {Marine radar plays a significant role in ship navigation. However, when
   contending with interference among cosailing navigation radars, the echo
   data may be unintentionally corrupted, and it becomes challenging to
   obtain high-quality imagery using current radar imaging methods. To
   overcome this problem, an efficient anti-interference imaging framework
   is presented in this article based on the theory of nonuniform sampling.
   First, a beam-recursive anti-interference method based on the
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) estimation is proposed to
   compensate for the shortcoming of the traditional interference rejection
   method. Second, a nonuniform sampling model is established to well model
   the echo data with missing samples, which facilitates reconstructing the
   marine radar imagery from the missing echo data. Finally, a fast
   super-resolution method based on the dimension-reduction iterative
   adaptive approach (DRIAA) is proposed to reconstruct the distribution of
   sea-surface targets at a much lower computational complexity. Simulated
   and experimental results demonstrate that our anti-interference imaging
   framework can provide radar imagery with higher quality and lower
   computational complexity than the existing radar imaging methods in the
   presence of unintentional interference.},

   utilisation of active network management functionality at the MV level

   ensure reliable islanding detection without a non-detection zone. The
   combined scheme also prevents maloperations due to other disturbances.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a mixed-method study from 2016 in Gabura, Bangladesh
   examining female contribution to climate change adaptation in the period
   post-cyclone Aila in 2009. Out of 110 households studied, male household
   members were absent in 66 cases because they had migrated to nearby
   towns and regional centres for alternative livelihood options. Male
   members' absence created opportunities for Gabura women to develop a
   range of novel adaptation strategies through engagement with aid
   agencies, changed gender roles, leveraging social capital and utilizing
   local knowledge. For example, women are increasingly contributing to
   income through works within and outside of the house in agricultural
   innovations and handmade productions. These adaptations are built on
   social capital and trust between community women and the NGOs through
   mobilization and sharing of local knowledge. Based on the findings, a
   framework for informed autonomous adaptation is proposed. The
   generalization of coastal women in developing contexts as passive
   victims of climate change due to social norms and instead highlights
   women's active agencies in adaptation is challenged. There is a need for
   a critical understanding of gender-specific dynamics in post-cyclone aid
   interventions towards in-situ climate change adaptation.},

Abstract = {Climate change biology is seeing a wave of new contributions, which are
   reviewed herein. Contributions treat shifts in phenology and
   distribution, and both document past and forecast future effects.
   However, many of the current wave of contributions are observational and
   correlational, and few are experimental in nature, and too often a
   conceptual framework in which to contextualize the results is lacking.
   An additional gap is the lack of effective cross-linking among areas of
   research, for example, connection of sea-level rise and climate change
   implications for distributions of species, or evolutionary adaptation
   studies with distributional shift studies. Although numerous important
   contributions have emerged in recent years, synthesis of this phenomenon
   and its consequences has not yet been achieved. (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {Wind energy is increasingly considered one of the most promising
   sustainable energy sources for its characteristics of cleanliness
   without any pollution. Wind speed forecasting is a vital problem in wind
   power industry. However, individual forecasting models ignore the
   significance of data preprocessing and model parameter optimization,
   which may lead to poor forecasting performance. In this paper, a novel
   hybrid
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -ABBP (back propagation based on adaptive strategy with parameters
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   and
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   ) model was developed based on an adaptive boosting (AB) strategy that
   integrates several BP (back propagation) neural networks for wind speed
   forecasting. The fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition technique is
   initially conducted in the preprocessing stage to reconstruct data,
   while a novel modified FPA (flower pollination algorithm) incorporating
   a conjugate gradient (CG) is proposed for searching for the optimal
   parameters of the
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -ABBP mode. The case studies of five wind power stations in Penglai,
   China are used as illustrative examples for evaluating the effectiveness
   and efficiency of the developed hybrid forecast strategy. Numerical
   results show that the developed hybrid model is simple and can
   satisfactorily approximate the actual wind speed series. Therefore, the
   developed hybrid model can be an effective tool in mining and analysis
   for wind power plants.},

Title = {Formulating Natural Hazard Policies under Uncertainty},
Journal = {SIAM-ASA JOURNAL ON UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-56},
Abstract = {Uncertainty issues are crucial in assessing the risk posed by natural
   hazards and developing strategies to mitigate their consequences for
   society. The challenges are illustrated by the giant earthquake that
   struck Japan's Tohoku coast in March, 2011, which was much larger than
   had been predicted by sophisticated hazard models and so caused a
   tsunami that overtopped 5-10 m seawalls, causing more than 15,000 deaths
   and \$ 210 billion damage. Deciding whether to rebuild these defenses
   and more generally what strategies to employ against such rare events
   depends on estimating the balance between the costs and benefits of
   mitigation. Making such estimates is a complex challenge at the
   intersection of geoscience, mathematics, and economics. The major
   uncertainty is the probabilities of the rare, extreme events and the
   waiting or recurrence times between them. The probabilities of these
   events are difficult to estimate because the physics of earthquake
   recurrence is not adequately understood, and the short geologic record
   provides only a few observations. We present a general stochastic model
   in which the probabilities either are constant with time or depend on
   the previous history. We then develop models for two hazard policy
   issues facing Japan. One uses a stochastic model to select an optimum
   mitigation strategy against future tsunamis by minimizing the sum of the
   expected present value of the damage, the costs of mitigation, and a
   risk premium reflecting the variance of the hazard. We also consider
   whether new nuclear power plants should be built, using a deterministic
   model that does not require estimating essentially unknown
   probabilities. These models can be generalized to mitigation policy
   situations involving other natural hazards.},

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {1261-1265},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As global temperatures increase, fish populations at low latitudes are
   thought to be at risk as they are adapted to narrow temperature ranges
   and live at temperatures close to their thermal tolerance limits.
   Behavioural movements, based on a preference for a specific temperature
   (T (pref)), may provide a strategy to cope with changing conditions. A
   temperature-sensitive coral reef cardinalfish (Cheilodipterus
   quinquelineatus) was exposed to 28 A degrees C (average at collection
   site) or 32 A degrees C (predicted end-of-century) for 6 weeks. T (pref)
   was determined using a shuttlebox system, which allowed fish to
   behaviourally manipulate their thermal environment. Regardless of
   treatment temperature, fish preferred 29.5 +/- A 0.25 A degrees C,
   approximating summer average temperatures in the wild. However, 32 A
   degrees C fish moved more frequently to correct their thermal
   environment than 28 A degrees C fish, and daytime movements were more
   frequent than night-time movements. Understanding temperature-mediated
   movements is imperative for predicting how ocean warming will influence
   coral reef species and distribution patterns.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {122},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The ocean is threatened by climate change, overexploitation, pollution,
   habitat loss, and other pressures as well as their cumulative impacts.
   Over 60\% of the ocean that lies in areas beyond national jurisdiction
   (ABNJ) is particularly vulnerable. Many are seeking practical measures
   to make the ocean more resilient. This paper evaluates how key
   ingredients for enhancing resilience might be applied to ABNJ management
   and governance. In doing so, it aims to enhance the resilience of both
   marine ecosystems as well as their governance systems. It also throws
   light on how the emerging treaty on the conservation and sustainable use
   of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ)
   could contribute to it. A BBNJ treaty based on principles and approaches
   to safeguard resilience could help marine ecosystems cope with the
   growing anthropogenic threats and improve the effectiveness of
   management activities.},

Title = {Climate Change Projections of Temperature Over the Coastal Area of China
   Using SimCLIM},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Facing the western Pacific Ocean and backed by the Eurasian continent,
   the coastal area of China (hereafter as CAC) is sensitive and vulnerable
   to climate change due to the compound effects of land-ocean-atmosphere,
   and thus is prone to suffer huge climate-related disaster losses because
   of its large population density and fast developed economy in the
   context of global warming. Here in this study the near- (2040), mid-
   (2070), and long-future (2100) mean, minimum, and maximum temperature
   (Tmean, Tmin, and Tmax) projections based on the statistic downscaling
   climate prediction model (SimCLIM) integrated with 44 General
   Circulation Models (GCMs) of CMIP5 under three representative
   concentration pathway (RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) scenarios are
   evaluated over CAC and its sub-regions. Multi-model ensemble of the
   selected GCMs demonstrated that there was a dominating and consistent
   warming trend of Tmean, Tmin, and Tmax in the Chinese coastal area in
   the future. Under RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios, the annual
   temperature increase was respectively projected to be in the range of
   0.8-1.2 degrees C for 2040, 1.5-2.7 degrees C for 2070, and 1.6-4.4
   degrees C for 2100 over the entire CAC. Moreover, a spatial
   differentiation of temperature changes both on the sub-regional and
   meteorological station scales was also revealed, generally showing an
   increment with ``high south and low north{''} for annual average Tmean
   but ``high north and low south{''} for Tmin and Tmax. An obvious lower
   increase of Tmean in the hotter months like July and August in the south
   and a significant sharper increment of Tmin and Tmax in the colder
   months such as January, February, and December in the north were
   expected in the future. Results derived from this study are anticipated
   to provide insights into future temperature changes and also assist in
   the development of target climate change mitigation and adaptation
   measures in the coastal area of China.},

Title = {Utilization of geoindicators for rapid assessment of coastal-hazard risk
   and mitigation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Pages = {647-670},
Abstract = {Geoindicators provide a management tool for rapid assessment of natural
   hazard risk potential, either as a supplement to long-term environmental
   auditing and monitoring, or for initial coastal assessment as in
   developing countries. Using examples of barrier island and bluffed
   coasts, indicators of process/response are examined regionally, locally,
   and site-specifically; the latter being the primary indicators of
   property-threatening hazards. Tabled evaluation parameters range from
   general (elevation and vegetation) to specific characteristics such as
   shoreline stability and configuration, inlet proximity, and
   barrier-island interior geomorphology. Geoindicators also provide
   guidance for local mitigation of hazard impacts. A case study of Bogue
   Banks, North Carolina, shows that the geoindicators approach is
   applicable to communities with extant management plans. Bogue Banks'
   five communities must reevaluate mitigation strategies after every storm
   and because of changes induced through development. By applying the
   geoindicators approach, shoreline reaches as well as interior areas may
   be reassigned as to the level of risk, and appropriate mitigation
   actions taken. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {How the end of armed conflicts influence forest cover and subsequently
   ecosystem services provision? An analysis of four case studies in
   biodiversity hotspots},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {267-275},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ecosystem Services are commonly understood as the goods and services
   people obtain from nature, such as carbon sequestration, provision of
   food and fibres, pollination, etc. The provision of these services is in
   part closely related to the level of biodiversity in a region. Since
   some forested regions are considered biodiversity hotspots, the loss of
   such forested areas would affect the provision of ecosystem services.
   Among others, expansion of the agricultural frontier, demand for timber,
   weak enforcement of environmental regulations, or illegal logging are
   some of the key factors contributing to forest loss. These factors can
   be supported or enhanced during or after periods of extreme social
   instability such as armed conflicts or wars. Analyzing forest cover data
   for four different countries that have experienced armed conflicts in
   the recent past (Nepal, Sri Lanka, Ivory Coast and Peru), we seek to
   understand the influence of armed conflicts in ecosystem services
   provision, aiming to identify social, political and institutional
   drivers. Our four case studies show that at the end of their armed
   conflicts, on an average there was a 68.08\% increase of annual forest
   loss in the five years following the end of conflict, as compared to the
   worldwide 7.20\% mean. We identified inappropriate governance and
   institutional arrangements as the key driver during the transition
   period. We argue that as part of a family of bottom-up approaches, the
   adaptiveco-management approach is a promising option to deal with
   similar situations in the future, helping to keep a sustainable
   provision of ecosystem services.},

Title = {Predicting Salinization Trends in a Lowland Coastal Aquifer: Comacchio
   (Italy)},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {603-618},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The coastal aquifer salinization is an urgent problem caused by
   groundwater resources overexploitation and climate change. This
   phenomenon is enhanced in areas lying below the sea level, like the
   polders in the Netherlands or the Po River lowland in Italy. In these
   reclaimed lands the saltwater intrusion is usually controlled by a
   network of irrigation canals that supplies freshwater to the shallow
   aquifer, maintaining soil salinity at acceptable levels. The 2012 was
   dramatic in terms of agricultural water supply, since the Po River plain
   experienced a prolonged drought. Despite this, continuous monitoring of
   piezometric heads and total dissolved solids (TDS) near a canal (Canale
   della Gronda) demonstrated that freshening was occurring in the shallow
   portion (first 4 m) of the unconfined aquifer, while the bottom part was
   characterized by elevated relic salinity. The two-dimensional model
   SEAWAT was calibrated using piezometric heads and TDS depth profiles
   measured along a transect perpendicular to the canal. The calibrated
   model was then used to predict the behaviour of this cross section using
   a multiple scenario approach: increase in evapotranspiration induced by
   temperature increase; increase in the frequency of extreme high rainfall
   events; extreme drought conditions; and canal dewatering due to
   salinization of the water courses. Moreover, for each scenario, two
   sub-scenarios were run to account for projected sea level rise. The
   first three scenarios had only a minor influence on the aquifer
   salinization rate, while the fourth one predicted serious upward flux of
   the high salinity groundwater actually residing in the bottom of the
   unconfined aquifer. The scenarios quantified the possible future effects
   on groundwater salinization and could be useful to find adaptation
   strategies to manage the water resources of this and similar areas.},

   The case of the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Biodiversity has gained international relevance with the Convention on
   Biological Diversity (CBD). An important signatory of the agreement,
   Brazil is a megadiverse country with vast biomes. Internally, the
   Brazilian federative organization is characterized by discrepancies
   between the jurisdictional scale and natural boundaries. From a
   governance perspective, this article analyzes how political
   administrative bodies deal with biome subsets, using the Atlantic Forest
   biome as reference. The problem was researched through the dynamics
   between scales and levels, considering the action of governmental and
   non-governmental actors in the process, in the context of an adaptive
   approach. To overcome the mismatches between the federative structure
   and the biome, we present the `governance of scales' model, which
   proposes articulation between the spatial scale and jurisdictional
   scale, through the institutional and management scales. Previous
   experiences of the Brazilian government in harmonizing watersheds and
   the coastal region with federalism enhance the feasibility of our
   biome-level proposal. The model is a useful contribution to biodiversity
   governance in favor of novel arrangements to improve the fit between
   social and ecological systems. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Vulnerability, Risk and Adaptation Assessment Methods in the Pacific

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Over two decades of vulnerability assessments have shown the Pacific
   Islands region to be one of the regions most at risk to the adverse
   consequences of climate change. Pacific Island countries have shown
   strong leadership in characterising the challenges of climate change,
   both nationally and for the region as a whole, and in identifying the
   most appropriate responses. This paper reviews the various
   Vulnerability, Risk and Adaptation (VRiA) Assessment Methods and Tools
   that have been used across the Pacific Islands region, with an emphasis
   on the past two decades. The aim is to identify the approaches that are
   best suited to the region, and to develop a common understanding and
   principles that may be relevant and useful to harmonising the assessment
   of vulnerability and risk, and of adaptation options across the region.
   Even though assessments undertaken in the Pacific Islands region tend to
   share the common objective of reducing vulnerabilities and risks,
   practitioners in the Pacific are using numerous approaches, methods and
   tools to assess vulnerabilities and identify possible adaptation
   interventions. No one approach will address all needs and accommodate
   all capacities. Rather, several successful approaches, methods and tools
   are identified. The paper also identifies and assesses the approaches,
   methods and tools that have merit for further use, without or with
   further improvements. Lessons learned as well as success stories and
   success factors are documented. These findings are reflected in
   principles designed to assist harmonisation of approaches to VRiA
   assessment. These principles, in turn, influence the development of a
   proposed higher-level framework and approach for VRiA assessments. It
   accommodates the various approaches, methods and tools commonly used
   with success in the Pacific.},

Title = {The perception of climate-related coastal risks and environmental
   changes on the Rangiroa and Tikehau atolls, French Polynesia: The role
   of sensitive and intellectual drivers},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {14-29},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {French coastal policies have recently put greater emphasis on the need
   to better inform coastal populations about coastal risks in the context
   of climate change, in particular in French overseas territories that are
   nationally recognized as hotspots. It is therefore critical to further
   assess local populations' knowledge and perceptions of climate-related
   coastal risks. In this respect, we ran a social survey among inhabitants
   of two atolls of French Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean, using a
   questionnaire and semi-structured interviews largely based on images of
   landscapes. The results show that (1) coastal risks are not considered
   as a danger but only as a problem, and that (2) inhabitants have a very
   clear perception of the changes that have occurred locally over the last
   70 years with respect to weather, climate, corals and beaches. (3)
   Interviewees generally show some knowledge about the notion of global
   climate change and its potential local impacts. (4) However, a multiple
   correspondence analysis distinguishes four groups (the `informed',
   `poorly informed, `uninformed' and `distant' groups) separated by age
   and gender, but also by levels of education and urbanization. The
   discussion therefore focuses on the most important drivers of climate
   change perception, showing a disconnection between atolls and
   generations: rural and older inhabitants present more sensitive
   mechanisms of risk perception and urban and younger interviewees more
   intellectual ones. A major challenge consists in bringing these
   dimensions closer by better integrating, on an intellectual level, local
   climate-related coastal risks into school programs, and by defining, on
   a more sensitive level, an ambitious cultural and environmental policy
   to allow young generations to keep contact with their original living
   environment. Highlighting the interest of this survey, risk management
   and adaptation policies now support the reactivation of local knowledge
   and practices.},

Abstract = {Aiming at the improvement of a dense urban area's microclimatic
   conditions, this study examines by simulation means, the application of
   highly reflective materials as a mitigation strategy. However, as
   significant albedo changes may occur due to weathering and aging, the
   study investigates the surface (Tsurf) and air (Tair) temperature
   cooling potential of cool paving materials, both for the design and the
   aged values of solar reflectance; the aged albedo values are issued from
   previously reported experimental campaigns. Since the majority of the
   existing studies evaluate the cool materials' impact at the pedestrian's
   height, the current work aims to provide further insight on the vertical
   profile of the achieved Tair reduction due to cool pavements, at
   different heights of the study area's canyons. The analysis revealed
   that the Tsurf and Tair decrease due to cool pavements is reduced by
   50\%, when the aged albedo values are considered, while the obtained
   Tair reduction is negatively related to the distance from the ground.
   The accurate assessment of the high albedo materials' effect on the
   urban microclimate imposes thus the consideration of the albedo
   degradation due to weathering and aging whereas extra effort should be
   given on the development of cold materials standing the test of time.},

Title = {Sea-level rise vulnerability in the countries of the Coral Triangle},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise is a major threat facing the Coral Triangle countries in
   the twenty-first century. Assessments of vulnerability and adaptation
   that consider the interactions among natural and social systems are
   critical to identifying habitats and communities vulnerable to sea-level
   rise and for supporting the development of adaptation strategies. This
   paper presents such an assessment using the DIVA model and identifies
   vulnerable coastal regions and habitats in Coral Triangle countries at
   national and sub-national levels (administrative provinces). The
   following four main sea-level rise impacts are assessed in ecological,
   social and economic terms over the twenty-first century: (1) coastal
   wetland change, (2) increased coastal flooding, (3) increased coastal
   erosion, and (4) saltwater intrusion into estuaries and deltas. The
   results suggest that sea-level rise will significantly affect coastal
   regions and habitats in the Coral Triangle countries, but the impacts
   will differ across the region in terms of people flooded annually,
   coastal wetland change and loss, and damage and adaptation costs.
   Indonesia is projected to be most affected by coastal flooding, with
   nearly 5.9 million people expected to experience flooding annually in
   2100 assuming no adaptation. However, if adaptation is considered, this
   number is significantly reduced. By the end of the century, coastal
   wetland loss is most significant for Indonesia in terms of total area
   lost, but the Solomon Islands are projected to experience the greatest
   relative loss of coastal wetlands. Damage costs associated with
   sea-level rise are highest in the Philippines (US \$6.5 billion/year)
   and lowest in the Solomon Islands (US \$70,000/year). Adaptation is
   estimated to reduce damage costs significantly, in particular for the
   Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia (between 68 and 99\%). These
   results suggest that the impacts of sea-level rise are likely to be
   widespread in the region and adaptation measures must be broadly
   applied.},

Title = {Nearshore sediment transport as influenced by changing sea ice, north
   shore of Prince Edward Island, Canada},
Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES},
Abstract = {This study considers the influence of changing sea ice on nearshore
   sediment transport in the central north shore of Prince Edward Island,
   Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is widely accepted that changing
   climate is causing sea ice to decrease in the region. Sea ice attenuates
   wave energy thereby reducing sediment transport. The Delft3D
   hydrodynamic model is used to simulate waves, currents, and sediment
   transport in seven sea ice concentration scenarios that can be
   dif-ferentiated into four classes: open water (<10\%), low ice (10\% to
   35\%), moderate ice (36\% to 60\%), and high ice (>60\%). If ice
   concentration decreases from high to moderate, sediment transport is
   expected to increase 23\%. Similarly, if ice concentra-tion decreases
   from moderate to low, sediment transport is expected to increase a
   further 24\%. If ice concentration decreases from low to open water
   conditions, sediment transport is expected to abruptly increase a
   further 85\%. The increase in sediment transport as sea ice decreases
   from high concentration to open water conditions is 180\%. Linear and
   power-law fits of sediment transport and sea ice concentration intersect
   at an ice concentration of 30\%, indicating this value may be a useful
   threshold in planning for increased coastal erosion and developing
   appropriate adaptation strategies, in particular, adapting to increased
   sediment transport near tidal inlets and navigation channels.},

Abstract = {This research examines tourists' perceptions of a coastal destination
   that has suffered severe beach erosion and is undergoing beach
   replenishment. Officials assume that tourist will inevitably react,
   negatively to the transformed landscape; however, the findings indicate
   that tourists decode the site in polysemous ways. This study engages
   Lefebvre's triadic model of social space to inform the discussion of the
   symbolic landscapes meanings constructed by producers and consumers. The
   key argument is that in the advent of global climate change, both the
   material and social elements have to be considered to devise long-term
   adaptation measures. The findings shed light on complexities involved in
   tourism destination's adaptation to geomorphologic/climatic changes as
   well as contested meanings that emerge from the human-environment

Abstract = {Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are facing unprecedented
   pressures in the Anthropocene, with climate change being a primary
   stressor. To understand the biological response mechanisms along
   coastlines, the international scientific community requires coordinated
   action, integrating obervations through observatory networks and
   spatially extensive experiments using standardized approaches over broad
   geographic scales. Currently, however, a multinational, integrated
   approach is lacking, with little application of standard methodologies
   or data sharing across countries. Changes in the abundance, distribution
   and competitive dominance of rocky intertidal organisms are useful
   sentinels of climate change because these communities are easy to
   observe and long-term time series exist. Europe is in a prime position
   to lead by example, building on the extensive history of sustained
   observations and experimental research to establish an integrated
   network of studies and monitoring programmes. These will improve our
   understanding of how organismal responses translate into biogeographic
   range shifts, and generate more biologically realistic predictions of
   future climate change impacts with which to design mitigation,
   adaptation and conservation strategies.},

Title = {Urban heat island mitigation strategies and lizard thermal ecology:
   landscaping can quadruple potential activity time in an arid city},

Abstract = {A global warming of 2 A degrees C is predicted to drive almost half the
   world's lizard populations to extinction. Urban heat island (UHI)
   effects may further exacerbate the impacts of climate change on
   organisms that are sensitive to small changes in temperature. Currently,
   the Phoenix metropolitan region in Arizona, USA, is an average of 3 A
   degrees C warmer than the surrounding desert. With continuing
   urbanization and climate change, thermal stress will become an
   increasingly important facet of urban ecology in coming decades. The
   main objective of our study was to investigate which landscaping styles
   and microhabitat variables can most effectively reduce the surface
   temperatures experienced by lizards. Using a bare lot as a control, we
   placed copper lizard models with data loggers in several vegetation and
   irrigation treatments that represent the dominant backyard landscaping
   styles in Phoenix (grassy mesic with mist irrigation, drip irrigated
   xeric, unirrigated native, and a hybrid style known as oasis). Our
   lizard models recorded 6915 estimates of potential body temperatures. We
   show that lizard activity time in summer was restricted to a few hours
   in un-irrigated native desert landscaping, while heavily irrigated grass
   and shade trees allowed for continual activity during even the hottest
   days. Shade, humidity, and sky view factor explained the majority of
   variation in temperature at a sub-meter scale. We suggest that
   maintaining the existing diversity of landscaping styles (as part of an
   ongoing UHI mitigation strategy targeted at humans) will be beneficial
   for lizards.},

Title = {Modelling of the Discharge Response to Climate Change under RCP8.5
   Scenario in the Alata River Basin (Mersin, SE Turkey)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impacts of climate change on the
   hydrological response of a Mediterranean mesoscale catchment using a
   hydrological model. The effect of climate change on the discharge of the
   Alata River Basin in Mersin province (Turkey) was assessed under the
   worst-case climate change scenario (i.e., RCP8.5), using the
   semi-distributed, process-based hydrological model Hydrological
   Predictions for the Environment (HYPE). First, the model was evaluated
   temporally and spatially and has been shown to reproduce the measured
   discharge consistently. Second, the discharge was predicted under
   climate projections in three distinct future periods (i.e., 2021-2040,
   2046-2065 and 2081-2100, reflecting the beginning, middle and end of the
   century, respectively). Climate change projections showed that the
   annual mean temperature in the Alata River Basin rises for the
   beginning, middle and end of the century, with about 1.35, 2.13 and 4.11
   degrees C, respectively. Besides, the highest discharge timing seems to
   occur one month earlier (February instead of March) compared to the
   baseline period (2000-2011) in the beginning and middle of the century.
   The results show a decrease in precipitation and an increase in
   temperature in all future projections, resulting in more snowmelt and
   higher discharge generation in the beginning and middle of the century
   scenarios. However, at the end of the century, the discharge
   significantly decreased due to increased evapotranspiration and reduced
   snow depth in the upstream area. The findings of this study can help
   develop efficient climate change adaptation options in the Levant's
   coastal areas.},

Abstract = {The resilience perspective is increasingly used as an approach for
   understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems. This article
   presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an
   overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology
   and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the
   1960-1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge
   the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes
   non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods
   of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such
   dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was
   dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in
   mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach
   for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the
   social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected
   in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new
   discoveries of linked social-ecological systems. Recent advances include
   understanding of social processes like, social learning and social
   memory, mental models and knowledge-system integration, visioning and
   scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks,
   institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity,
   transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for
   management of essential ecosystem services. (c) 2006 Published by

   traditional agriculture is discussed, with an emphasis on methane
   formation through wet rice cultivation. The chapter examines natural
   climate variability, for example the East Asian monsoon, which
   influences climate variability, and then presents information on
   observed climate change effects: changes in temperature, precipitation,
   surface evaporation, and sunshine duration. A special section examines
   extreme weather events in recent years, covering floods, drought, heat
   waves, sea level rises, and typhoons. The last section of the chapter
   introduces models used by Chinese scientists and preliminary estimates
   on ways in which climate change will affect production of rice, wheat,
   maize, and cotton. It also discusses the limitation of climate change
   models in predicting outcomes for China's food security.},

Title = {Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood risk and its driving
   factors in a coastal watershed of southeastern China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization and climate change can cause more extensive flood
   risk, in the absence of urgent and efficient adaptation measures. As the
   occurrence of floods varies with time and space, comprehensive and
   dynamical assessment of the spatiotemporal variability of flood risk and
   understanding of its drivers is vital for flood risk management. In this
   study, we developed a spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA) framework
   for quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood risk through a case
   study in a coastal watershed of southeastern China from 1990 to 2015. A
   comprehensive framework for flood risk assessment was constructed from
   the hazard, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity components with
   23 indicators. The results showed that the highest risk happened in the
   stage of 2006-2010, while the lowest risk stage was 2011-2015, with
   higher flood risk in the downstream areas of Jiulong River watershed
   (JRW). The contribution of each indicator reflects the difference in
   temporal, spatial and quantity aspects. The top 5 driving factors for
   JRW included: peak discharge, maximum daily rainfall, age structure,
   wetland, and reservoir. The risk perception showed a continuous growing
   impact on flood risk. However, some indicators only showed obvious
   contributions in the specified area: for example, the built-up expansion
   in Zhangzhou city; the increase of dike length and the improvement of
   dike standard in Xinluo district; and the increase of government
   financial investment in Zhangping and Liancheng district. This study
   demonstrates the well-performance of our proposed novel approach for
   flood risk assessment. Our results and conclusions are also of
   significance for policymakers to understand and point out the
   deficiencies in the current actions of flood adaption, and consequently
   develop more targeted and spatially-specific strategies for flood
   adaptation, in the context of climate change and rapid urbanization.},

   covered with man-made materials that absorb the sun's energy. Dark
   colored roads and roofs have replaced surface area which was once
   predominantly vegetated lands. Impervious pavements cover a large amount
   of urban surface area, typically 30-45 \%. For these reasons summertime
   ambient temperatures in cities are typically warmer than those of rural
   areas. Heat islands lead to increased air conditioning use which puts a
   strain on a city's energy grid. To supply this extra wattage, power
   plants must work harder and as a result emit more carbon. Therefore, the
   heat island effect contributes to environmental problems including air
   quality and climate change. One solution to this problem is the
   implementation of cool pavement technologies in areas of where less
   stringent structural requirements exist, such as parking lots and low
   volume roads. Cool pavements are a class of materials that exhibit
   enhanced cooling by means of increased reflectivity or increased
   convection. This chapter correlates heat island effect to climate change
   as well as outlining the different cool pavement technologies which may
   help to mitigate climate change effects.},

   this paper proposes an alternative approach to revenue management that
   monitors key revenue management metrics and take corrective action with
   demand and supply levers to make the revenue plan happen. In a COVID-19
   era, in the absence of reliable demand forecasts, this operationally
   driven robust revenue management approach is a viable alternative to

Abstract = {While climate change mitigation targets necessarily concern maximum mean
   state changes, understanding impacts and developing adaptation
   strategies will be largely contingent on how climate variability
   responds to increasing anthropogenic perturbations. Thus far Earth
   system modeling efforts have primarily focused on projected mean state
   changes and the sensitivity of specific modes of climate variability,
   such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, our knowledge of
   forced changes in the overall spectrum of climate variability and
   higher-order statistics is relatively limited. Here we present a new
   100-member large ensemble of climate change projections conducted with
   the Community Earth System Model version 2 over 1850-2100 to examine the
   sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. Our
   unprecedented simulations reveal that changes in variability, considered
   broadly in terms of probability distribution, amplitude, frequency,
   phasing, and patterns, are ubiquitous and span a wide range of physical
   and ecosystem variables across many spatial and temporal scales.
   Greenhouse warming in the model alters variance spectra of Earth system
   variables that are characterized by non-Gaussian probability
   distributions, such as rainfall, primary production, or fire occurrence.
   Our modeling results have important implications for climate adaptation
   efforts, resource management, seasonal predictions, and assessing
   potential stressors for terrestrial and marine ecosystems.},

Title = {``We are feeling older than our age{''}: Vulnerability and adaptive
   strategies of aging people to cyclones in coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bangladesh has been affected by the adverse impact of natural hazards
   such as cyclones, floods, erosion, salinity intrusion, and so on due to
   the changes in global climate variability. Among the environmental
   stressors, tropical cyclones frequently impact the coastal people of
   Bangladesh. This paper details a study on the vulnerability and
   adaptation strategies of older people in the face of cyclones in a
   coastal location in Bangladesh using qualitative strategy of enquiry.
   Field data have been collected through 32 semi-structured interviews,
   three focus group discussions, and three oral history in three selected
   villages (Lebubunia, Gabura and Dumuria) in the study area. In this
   research, we argue that the aged are more affected compared to an adult
   in a cyclone. Findings show that due to their fewer assets and
   dependency on young adult family members, older people experience high
   vulnerability in cyclone landfall. Moreover, their lesser physical
   strength and weakening mental capacity make them vulnerable. In the
   absence of appropriate essential initiatives-lack of social awareness,
   training, limited access to health facilities-vulnerability borders on
   the extreme. Often the elderly are deprived of proper sanitation and
   hygiene facilities, food security, and family care and support. Many
   also lack access to government income support. To increase older
   persons' adaptability to cyclone disasters, all levels of society need
   to pay them special attention. This necessitates government
   institutions, NGOs and other stakeholders working collectively to reduce
   the risk to and vulnerability of the aged to cyclones. An older people's
   agenda framework also needs to be created.},

Abstract = {The reintroduction of green infrastructure is a recognized approach to
   mitigating heat islands and flash floods in urban areas. Depending on
   its type and extent, green infrastructure (GI) can reduce local urban
   temperatures significantly and at the same time reduce the risk of
   flooding. This article views the streetscape as an important area of
   activity for GI-based climate-adaptation interventions for two main
   reasons: it serves as a conduit for urban human activity and mobility,
   and it acts as a significant heat store. The approach proposed unites
   some key elements that can form the basis for all future public-realm
   (streetscape) design, promoting a truly climate-responsive urban
   environment. These include reduction of sealing to only essential areas,
   decentralized water management using rain-garden technology, low
   maintenance, aesthetic planting supporting biodiversity, and
   sensor-based monitoring of thermal comfort parameters to optimize
   measures. It utilizes low-cost sensors for obtaining thermal comfort
   data to locate urban heat islands. It also proposes a GIS-based decision
   tool bringing together relevant data sets: temperature, level of surface
   sealing, and flood risk, as well as aspects such as the location of
   services, traffic, and urban planning. A pilot application as part of an
   ongoing Austrian government-funded climate adaptation project is
   described in which this methodology has been applied.},

Abstract = {Large-scale water management systems were introduced to the
   Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong Deltas in the latter half of the twentieth
   century to manage extreme water hazards and increase food production.
   However, these systems significantly altered their respective
   hydrological regimes, often creating worse socio-ecological conditions
   and greater vulnerability to floods and seawater intrusion than existed
   previously. Despite this history of disaster experience, climate change
   adaptation measures in the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong Deltas use
   contemporary socio-ecological conditions as the baseline for disaster
   mitigation efforts. Paradoxically relying on old approaches to address
   future climate threats, disaster planners overlook how current
   conditions in both deltas are unstable outcomes of historical processes.
   These cases illustrate that large-scale and capital-intensive climate
   responses may fail to measurably reduce disaster risk. The concept of
   shifting baselines, borrowed from fisheries science, becomes helpful for
   selecting more appropriate reference points for disaster mitigation than
   current conditions.},

Abstract = {Integrated risk assessment approaches to support coastal managers'
   decisions when designing plans are increasingly becoming an urgent need.
   To enable efficient coastal management, possible present and future
   scenarios must be included, disaster risk reduction measures integrated,
   and multiple hazards dealt with. In this work, the Bayesian
   network-based approach to coastal risk assessment was applied and tested
   at two Mediterranean sandy coasts (Tordera Delta in Spain and Lido degli
   Estensi-Spina in Italy). Process-oriented models are used to predict
   hazards at the receptor scale which are converted into impacts through
   vulnerability relations. In each site, results from 96 simulations under
   different scenarios are integrated by using a Bayesian-based decision
   network to link forcing characteristics with expected impacts through
   conditional probabilities. Consultations with local stakeholders and
   experts have shown that the tool is valuable for communicating risks and
   the effects of risk reduction strategies. The tool can therefore be
   valuable support for coastal decision-making.},

Title = {Projecting corn and soybeans yields under climate change in a Corn Belt
   watershed},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {90-99},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change may have positive or negative effects on agricultural
   yields depending on location and mitigation and adaptation practices.
   This research investigates future corn and soybean yields in the Raccoon
   watershed, in the US Corn Belt, using projected climate data. We used
   the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to estimate the
   impact of climate change for 2015-2099 with data downscaled from eight
   atmosphere ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) with three
   emissions pathways reflecting low, medium and high greenhoilse gas
   emissions scenarios. Soil properties were gathered from the Soil Survey
   Geographic Database and data on crop rotations was derived from
   CropScape, a geospatial cropland data layer product of the US National
   Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Our findings indicate that
   20-year mean yields of both corn and soybean for 2080-2099 simulated in
   EPIC using all eight AOGCMs under low and medium carbon scenarios will
   increase in comparison to the 20-year mean yields for 2015-2034.
   However, under the high carbon scenario, 20-year means of both corn and
   soybean yields for 2080-2099 will decline in comparison to the 20-year
   mean yields for 2015-2034, pointing to the effects of climate change. We
   also examined the possible impact of carbon fertilization on yields. Our
   results show that carbon fertilization of soybean, a C-3 plant, may
   contribute to an increase in yield of 2\% to 20\% while its contribution
   to the growth of corn, a C-4 plant, will be much lower. (C) 2016

Title = {Knowledge, attitudes and practices of climate adaptation actors towards
   resilience and transformation in a 1.5 degrees C world},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {152-159},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement signifies the commitment of the
   international community to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees C
   above pre-industrial levels and further to 1.5 degrees C. To prepare for
   increasing temperatures, climate adaptation actors are prioritizing
   climate resilience- and transformation-based activities. There is,
   however, limited understanding of actors' knowledge of and attitudes and
   practices towards these global temperature targets and concepts. Using
   the case of Caribbean small island developing states, we qualitatively
   analyze in-depth interviews with 35 climate change donors and project
   implementers. We find that most actors are aware of the 2 degrees C and
   1.5 degrees C targets but that all are pessimistic about their
   achievement. Project implementers do not have a clear way to incorporate
   these targets into their adaptation projects. We also find that there is
   no uniform understanding of `resilience' and `transformation', though
   actors commonly define `resilience' as the ability to `bounce back' from
   extreme events and note `transformation' as requiring the disruption of
   current socio-economic and political systems. Actors are further
   pessimistic about achieving resilience goals within short programming
   and funding cycles. Our study highlights the need for the global
   temperature targets to be urgently translated into the design and
   implementation of adaptation projects. We also highlight that the
   concepts of resilience and transformation are top-down and donor-driven,
   and that there is a need for donors to facilitate the creation of a
   shared vision of these concepts across all stakeholders.},

   Response to Extreme Hydrodynamic Conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {95},
Pages = {797-802},
Abstract = {To upgrade the response capability to coastal flood events, hazard
   predictions need to be improved through integrating the effect of the
   coastal morphological variability in the nearshore-foreshore-backshore
   hydromorphological processes induced by waves-tide-wind-atmospheric
   pressure. In order to evaluate the short-term morphological response of
   different coastal typologies to potential flood conditions (spring high
   tide level, storm surge, high wave height), field data acquired in 2019
   in three sites in the West coast of Portugal with past flooding episodes
   are presented and discussed. The preliminary results point out that
   under the same forcing conditions the short-term response of the
   cross-shore beach profile that controls the flooding levels is dependent
   on the beach typology, namely: the nature of the lower and upper limits
   of the beach face, profile gradient and its alongshore context. This
   knowledge can be used to develop robust and validated flood prediction
   tools contributing to improve mitigation and adaptation management
   strategies.},

Title = {Projecting global mariculture diversity under climate change},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2134-2148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Previous studies have focused on changes in the geographical
   distribution of terrestrial biomes and species targeted by marine
   capture fisheries due to climate change impacts. Given mariculture's
   substantial contribution to global seafood production and its growing
   significance in recent decades, it is essential to evaluate the effects
   of climate change on mariculture and their socio-economic consequences.
   Here, we projected climate change impacts on the marine aquaculture
   diversity for 85 of the currently most commonly farmed fish and
   invertebrate species in the world's coastal and/or open ocean areas.
   Results of ensemble projections from three Earth system models and three
   species distribution models show that climate change may lead to a
   substantial redistribution of mariculture species richness potential,
   with an average of 10\%-40\% decline in the number of species being
   potentially suitable to be farmed in tropical to subtropical regions. In
   contrast, mariculture species richness potential is projected to
   increase by about 40\% at higher latitudes under the `no mitigation
   policy' scenario (RCP 8.5) by the mid-21st century. In Exclusive
   Economic Zones where mariculture is currently undertaken, we projected
   an average future decline of 1.3\% and 5\% in mariculture species
   richness potential under RCP 2.6 ('strong mitigation') and RCP 8.5
   scenarios, respectively, by the 2050s relative to the 2000s. Our
   findings highlight the opportunities and challenges for climate
   adaptation in the mariculture sector through the redistribution of
   farmed species and expansion of mariculture locations. Our results can
   help inform adaptation planning and governance mechanisms to minimize
   local environmental impacts and potential conflicts with other marine
   and coastal sectors in the future.},

Title = {Stakeholder's (natural) hazard awareness and vulnerability of small

Abstract = {Small island tourism destinations are particularly vulnerable to
   (natural) hazards, disasters and crises. Although much literature
   considers disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies, risk mitigation and
   the impacts of disasters on the tourism industry, the literature on how
   these strategies are implemented and managed by stakeholders with vested
   interests is scarce. Understanding stakeholders' awareness of threats,
   and their ability and knowledge to respond to sudden and/or projected
   natural disasters is a key dimension in helping create and implement
   management plans, recognised in the UNISDR goals, Hyogo and Sendai
   Frameworks. With tourists increasingly travelling to destinations in
   locations of varying risk, this paper explores the intersections of
   stakeholder's (natural) hazard awareness and resulting vulnerability of
   small island tourism destinations utilising Malta as a case study
   setting, focusing on decision- and policy-making dimensions. Qualitative
   methods were utilised to consider hazard awareness in Malta and future
   management of vulnerability. Results indicate a recognition of an
   increasing need for integrated stakeholder collaboration, with flooding,
   drought and storms being the three most likely hazards to affect Malta.
   Key outcomes are a need for (natural) hazard awareness training and
   development of management plans to be implemented to benefit the general
   population and tourism sector.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {For coastal communities living in low elevation Pantai Acheh of Penang,
   Malaysia, salinization of groundwater caused by sea level rise (SLR)
   could pose a daunting challenge to water supply and crop cultivation,
   thereby undermining local water security (SDG6) and food security
   (SDG2). Modelling analysis using MANTRA was performed to examine the
   sustainability of coastal groundwater and vegetation in Pantai Acheh in
   response to SLR. MANTRA was developed by linking two United States
   Geological Survey (USGS) simulation models known as MANHAM and SUTRA.
   Simulation analysis revealed that Penang Island does not have viable
   fresh groundwater. Further, a projected 1-m SLR may lead to a 22\% loss
   in mangrove coverage within the study site, adversely impacting SDG2 and
   SDG6. Penang's current water management practices are not sustainable to
   meet growing demand for freshwater and to overcome the impacts of global
   climate change (GCC). Hence, alternative water supply options such as
   rainwater harvesting, groundwater exploitation and consumer education
   deserve careful consideration and research to ensure a sustainable water
   future for Penang Island towards achieving SDG6 and SDG2. Key elements
   for achieving these two SDGs include adapting integrated coastal zone
   management and integrated water management to mitigate increased risk of
   floods and droughts due to GCC and SLR, and protecting mangrove forests
   and their ecosystem services from further degradation.},

Title = {The effectiveness of cool and green roofs as urban heat island
   mitigation strategies},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mitigation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect at the city-scale is
   investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in
   conjunction with the Princeton Urban Canopy Model (PUCM). Specifically,
   the cooling impacts of green roof and cool (white/high-albedo) roof
   strategies over the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area during a heat
   wave period (7 June-10 June 2008) are assessed using the optimal set-up
   of WRF-PUCM described in the companion paper by Li and Bou-Zeid (2014).
   Results indicate that the surface UHI effect (defined based on the
   urban-rural surface temperature difference) is reduced significantly
   more than the near-surface UHI effect (defined based on urban-rural 2 m
   air temperature difference) when these mitigation strategies are
   adopted. In addition, as the green and cool roof fractions increase, the
   surface and near-surface UHIs are reduced almost linearly. Green roofs
   with relatively abundant soil moisture have comparable effect in
   reducing the surface and near-surface UHIs to cool roofs with an albedo
   value of 0.7. Significant indirect effects are also observed for both
   green and cool roof strategies; mainly, the low-level advection of
   atmospheric moisture from rural areas into urban terrain is enhanced
   when the fraction of these roofs increases, thus increasing the humidity
   in urban areas. The additional benefits or penalties associated with
   modifications of the main physical determinants of green or cool roof
   performance are also investigated. For green roofs, when the soil
   moisture is increased by irrigation, additional cooling effect is
   obtained, especially when the `unmanaged' soil moisture is low. The
   effects of changing the albedo of cool roofs are also substantial. These
   results also underline the capabilities of the WRF-PUCM framework to
   support detailed analysis and diagnosis of the UHI phenomenon, and of
   its different mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Deep Uncertainties in Sea-Level Rise and Storm Surge Projections:
   Implications for Coastal Flood Risk Management},
Journal = {RISK ANALYSIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {153-168},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sea levels are rising in many areas around the world, posing risks to
   coastal communities and infrastructures. Strategies for managing these
   flood risks present decision challenges that require a combination of
   geophysical, economic, and infrastructure models. Previous studies have
   broken important new ground on the considerable tensions between the
   costs of upgrading infrastructure and the damages that could result from
   extreme flood events. However, many risk-based adaptation strategies
   remain silent on certain potentially important uncertainties, as well as
   the tradeoffs between competing objectives. Here, we implement and
   improve on a classic decision-analytical model (Van Dantzig 1956) to:
   (i) capture tradeoffs across conflicting stakeholder objectives, (ii)
   demonstrate the consequences of structural uncertainties in the
   sea-level rise and storm surge models, and (iii) identify the parametric
   uncertainties that most strongly influence each objective using global
   sensitivity analysis. We find that the flood adaptation model produces
   potentially myopic solutions when formulated using traditional
   mean-centric decision theory. Moving from a single-objective problem
   formulation to one with multiobjective tradeoffs dramatically expands
   the decision space, and highlights the need for compromise solutions to
   address stakeholder preferences. We find deep structural uncertainties
   that have large effects on the model outcome, with the storm surge
   parameters accounting for the greatest impacts. Global sensitivity
   analysis effectively identifies important parameter interactions that
   local methods overlook, and that could have critical implications for
   flood adaptation strategies.},

Title = {An Assessment of How Australian Fisheries Management Plans Account for
   Climate Change Impacts},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {For Australian fisheries to remain productive and sustainable
   (environmentally and commercially), there is a need to incorporate
   climate change considerations into management and planning, and to
   implement planned climate adaptation options. Here, we determine the
   extent to which Australian state fisheries management documents consider
   issues relating to climate change, as well as how frequently climate
   change is considered a research funding priority within fisheries
   research in Australia. We conduct a content analysis of fisheries
   management documents investigating categories and themes relating to
   Australian state fisheries, climate, and environmental change. We also
   reviewed recent Research Priorities from the major fisheries research
   funding body for reference to climate change related themes, and the
   number of subsequently funded projects which considered climate change
   or related topics. Results show that commercial state fisheries
   management documents consider climate only to a limited degree in
   comparison to other topics, with less than one-quarter of all fisheries
   management documents having content relating to climate. However, we
   find that the south-east and south-west regions of the Australian
   coastline have the highest incorporation of ``climate{''} and
   ``environmental protection considerations{''} in their fisheries
   management documents, and that fisheries are more likely to have more
   ``climate-related mentions{''} within their related management
   documents, if they (i) primarily target species with higher economic
   commercial catch values, (ii) commercial catch weights, or (iii) a
   greater number of commercial fish stocks existing. Only a small number
   of recently funded fisheries research projects considered climate
   change, representing only a small proportion of fisheries research
   investment. Given the extensive climate-driven impacts recently
   documented among key Australian fisheries species and associated
   ecosystems, we conclude that there is a clear need for fisheries
   management in Australia to consider longer-term climate adaptation
   strategies for Australian commercial state fisheries to remain
   sustainable into the future. We suggest that without additional
   climate-related fisheries research and funding, many Australian agencies
   and fisheries may not be prepared for the impacts and subsequent
   adaptation efforts required for sustainable fisheries under climate
   change.},

Title = {Assessing organizational readiness to adapt to climate change in a
   regional protected areas context: lessons learned from Canada},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Parks and other forms of protected areas worldwide face significant
   threats from rapid climatic and associated ecological change. While the
   need to adapt to the impacts of climate change on biodiversity is widely
   acknowledged, and the extant literature has identified numerous
   adaptation options, much less is known about the institutional
   preconditions that enable or inhibit adaptation in resource management
   systems. We address this gap by presenting a framework that assesses the
   readiness of protected area organizations to adapt to climate change.
   Specifically, using a mixed methods approach including a literature
   review, online survey, and workshop, we: (1) adapt a framework to assess
   organizational adaptation readiness in protected areas organizations;
   (2) use the framework to assess organizational adaptation readiness in
   Bruce Peninsula National Park (BPNP) and Fathom Five National Marine
   Park (FFNMP) in Ontario, Canada, and (3) identify ways to strengthen the
   readiness of protected area organizations to respond to climate change.
   Results indicate that BPNP/FFNMP have low to moderate overall
   organizational adaptation readiness, with higher readiness in terms of
   understanding social-ecological systems (e.g., mapping and monitoring
   social and ecological values) and lower readiness in terms of
   collaboration, knowledge management and exchange. Recommendations to
   increase the organizational adaptation readiness of protected area
   organizations include increasing collaboration and knowledge exchange
   with partners, local residents, and Indigenous communities, and
   educating staff and visitors about climate change impacts. Overall,
   framework outcomes can be used to assess organizational strengths,
   weaknesses, and most importantly identify areas for resource allocation
   or re-allocation to enhance readiness and ensure that adaptation
   planning is translated into on-the-ground action.},

Title = {Human footprint and climate disappearance in vulnerable ecoregions of
   protected areas},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {260-268},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ecoregions are distinct groups of natural communities and species.
   Currently, some ecoregions of the world are considered as vulnerable.
   Protected areas (PM) can support the conservation of such vulnerable
   ecoregions. In this study, global PAs in different International Union
   for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) management categories and their
   vulnerable ecoregions were studied, and human footprint and climate
   disappearance were assessed. The human footprint was found to drive the
   ecoregional vulnerability of PM, which was high for vulnerable
   ecoregions in Europe, North America, and in smaller regions of Asia,
   Australia, New Zealand, and South America. These PAs included different
   biomes (excluding montane grasslands and shrublands) and affected IUCN
   PA management categories. Discrepancies may exist between observations
   and the present assignment of PM to IUCN categories considering the
   extent of the human footprint; hence, these categories need to be
   re-evaluated based on human influence. The obtained results indicate
   that vulnerable ecoregions in forest, tundra, and mangrove biomes in PM
   of eastern North America, Europe, south-eastern Asia, Australia, New
   Zealand, and the Pacific islands face high risks from climate
   disappearance. The ecoregional vulnerability of PM to both human
   influence and climate change was high in temperate broadleaf and mixed
   forests in south-eastern Asia, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. For
   global PM, we propose that: 1) long-term monitoring should be conducted
   for changes in temperature and precipitation in vulnerable ecoregions
   such as forest, tundra, and mangrove biomes; and 2) human influence and
   climate change are integrated into adaptive strategies for the
   conservation of vulnerable PA ecoregions.},

Title = {Optimal real estate capital durability and localized climate change
   disaster risk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The durability of the real estate capital stock could hinder climate
   change adaptation because past construction anchors the population in
   beautiful and productive but increasingly-risky coastal areas. However,
   coastal developers anticipate that their assets face increasing risk and
   this creates an incentive to seek adaptation strategies. This paper
   models climate change as a joint process of (1) increasingly destructive
   storms and (2) a risk of sea-level rise that submerges coastal property.
   We study how forward looking developers and real estate investors
   respond to the new risks along a number of dimensions including their
   choices of location, capital durability, capital mobility (modular real
   estate), and maintenance of existing properties. The net effect of such
   investments is a more resilient urban population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The study concerns a part of the research work developed within the
   project GreenCamp, funded by the Regione Toscana and aiming at defining
   a model of sustainable management and competitive territorial campsite
   cluster. The main objective of the study was a sustainable mobility
   system for the customers of 3 campsites, located in a protected area,
   through the evaluation of the economic and environmental sustainability.
   In order to assess the connection between the 3 campsites and the
   coastal area as well as the nearby Regional Park of Migliarino, San
   Rossore and Massaciuccoli, two alternatives for a sustainable mobility
   have been assessed: a diesel-powered tourist train and an electric
   tourist train.
   The comparison between the two alternatives has been carried out by an
   Environmental Impact Study, through the analysis of the main biotic and
   abiotic components as well as of the social economic aspects. The
   results of the study depicted the strengths and opportunities of both
   solutions, by also taking into account some weakness and threats.
   Nevertheless, through some compensation and mitigation measures, both
   solutions proved to be viable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Coastal communities in the Gold Coast, Australia, are particularly
   vulnerable to climate change, considering their exposure to changing sea
   levels and storms, the sensitivity of the sedimentary system, and the
   current capacity to respond to future challenges. In this paper we
   assessed the overall vulnerability of Palm Beach, a Gold Coast suburb,
   by (i) modeling extreme storms under future sea levels (ii) modeling the
   response of the beach to extreme storms under future sea levels (iii)
   assessing the level of adaptation of coastal management and the adaptive
   capacity of the coastal community. Results show that sea level rise can
   trigger higher storm surges and extreme erosion events and that the
   current level of adaptation and adaptive capacity is still insufficient
   to cope with such challenges.},

Abstract = {The Middle East and North Africa have witnessed a surfeit of geospatial
   data collection projects, resulting in big databases with powerful
   deductive capacities. Despite the valuable insights and expansive
   evidentiary record offered by those databases, emphasis on anthropogenic
   threats to cultural heritage, combined with a limited integration of
   local perspectives, have raised important questions on the ethical and
   epistemological dimensions of big data. This paper contextualizes
   maritime cultural heritage (MCH) in those debates through the lens of
   the Maritime Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and North Africa
   project (MarEA). MarEA is developing a unique for the region database
   for MCH designed to amalgamate a baseline record emphasizing spatial
   location, state of preservation, and vulnerability. This record will
   form a stepping stone toward finer-grained research on MCH and its
   interdisciplinary intersections. It is also developed as an information
   resource to facilitate local collaborators in prioritizing site
   monitoring and developing documentation, management, and mitigation
   strategies.},

Title = {Seaweed: A potential climate change solution},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {159},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change and environmental deterioration have spurred a blue
   carbon economic model in which fuel and food may be produced from marine
   ecosystems through the processes of carbon sequestration, carbon
   storage, and carbon harvest to substitute fossil products. This review
   discusses the potential of seaweed as a blue carbon sink and a renewable
   and sustainable energy source in the biogenic carbon cycle in the
   context of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Data
   were collected from more than 100 scientific articles, reliable
   organizations, and industry resources to a concise explanation and novel
   perspective on how seaweed can contribute considerably to the newly
   emerging blue carbon economy and revolutionary tools to combat climate
   change in the long term. According to the findings, seaweed has all the
   features required to be classified as a blue carbon habitat and a
   massive carbon sink. Besides its function in climate change adaptation
   and mitigation, seaweed is also a prelude to attaining a bioeconomy by
   lowering the reliance on fossil fuel. Documented evidence supports
   various applications in sectors as diverse as human meals, livestock
   feed, biofuels, and renewable feedstocks. However, the literature also
   identifies barriers to the implementation of seaweed farming operations.
   This review provides evidence that seaweed farming and industries are
   potential alternatives for future energy, decarbonization, and food
   security, mitigating global climate change and attaining economic growth
   and sustainable livelihoods.},

Title = {Advances in Modelling and Prediction on the Impact of Human Activities
   and Extreme Events on Environments},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fast urbanization and industrialization have progressively caused severe
   impacts on mountainous, river, and coastal environments, and have
   increased the risks for people living in these areas. Human activities
   have changed ecosystems hence it is important to determine ways to
   predict these consequences to enable the preservation and restoration of
   these key areas. Furthermore, extreme events attributed to climate
   change are becoming more frequent, aggravating the entire scenario and
   introducing ulterior uncertainties on the accurate and efficient
   management of these areas to protect the environment as well as the
   health and safety of people. In actual fact, climate change is altering
   rain patterns and causing extreme heat, as well as inducing other
   weather mutations. All these lead to more frequent natural disasters
   such as flood events, erosions, and the contamination and spreading of
   pollutants. Therefore, efforts need to be devoted to investigate the
   underlying causes, and to identify feasible mitigation and adaptation
   strategies to reduce negative impacts on both the environment and
   citizens. To contribute towards this aim, the selected papers in this
   Special Issue covered a wide range of issues that are mainly relevant
   to: (i) the numerical and experimental characterization of complex flow
   conditions under specific circumstances induced by the natural hazards;
   (ii) the effect of climate change on the hydrological processes in
   mountainous, river, and coastal environments, (iii) the protection of
   ecosystems and the restoration of areas damaged by the effects of
   climate change and human activities.},

Title = {Climate change: thinking small islands beyond Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS)},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Sea level rise and extreme weather events threaten the livelihoods and
   possibly the long-term existence of whole island nations. While the
   media, policy, and often scientific arenas essentially focus their
   attention on Small Island Developing States (SIDS), which are widely
   recognised as hotspots of global climate change, the situation of the
   numerous other vulnerable island territories has been relatively
   neglected. As a result, the focus on SIDS has paved the way for
   mainstream adaptation research and, in turn, for biases in the
   interpretation of climate change vulnerability and risks of small
   islands in general. Here, we argue that such an overly narrow scope
   severely limits our understanding of island-specific issues that
   influence island societies' adaptability to on-going and future climate
   change. This article reviews the current perspective on challenges and
   opportunities for climate change adaptation on SIDS and compares it with
   other types of island territories, especially dependent islands of
   continental states and semi-autonomous sub-national island jurisdictions
   (SNIJ). This comparison reveals that despite critical socio-political
   differences between the respective island types, more general lessons
   can be learned as island territories at large face similar issues both
   regarding the drivers of vulnerability and exposure and the adaptation
   measures needed. We propose an analytical framework for looking beyond
   SIDS' that includes the recognition of critical issues (asymmetrical
   governance structures, archipelagic constellations, inter-island
   connections) that shape island societies' vulnerability and leeway for
   adaptation to climate-related hazards.},

Pages = {1799-1804},

Abstract = {Continued anthropogenic CO2 emissions are expected to impact tropical
   coral reefs by further raising sea surface temperatures (SST) and
   intensifying ocean acidification (OA). Although geoengineering by means
   of solar radiation management (SRM) may mitigate temperature increases,
   OA will persist, raising important questions regarding the impact of
   different stressor combinations. We apply statistical Bioclimatic
   Envelope Models to project changes in shallow water tropical coral reef
   habitat as a single niche (without resolving biodiversity or community
   composition) under various representative concentration pathway and SRM
   scenarios, until 2070. We predict substantial reductions in habitat
   suitability centered on the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool under net
   anthropogenic radiative forcing of >= 3.0 W/m(2). The near-term dominant
   risk to coral reefs is increasing SSTs; below 3W/m(2) reasonably
   favorable conditions are maintained, even when achieved by SRM with
   persisting OA. ``Optimal{''} mitigation occurs at 1.5 W/m(2) because
   tropical SSTs overcool in a fully geoengineered (i.e., preindustrial
   global mean temperature) world.},

Title = {Trends and Potential Drivers of Distribution Overlap of River Herring
   and Commercially Exploited Pelagic Marine Fishes on the Northeast US
   Continental Shelf},
Journal = {MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-22},
Abstract = {Concern has been increasing over the impacts of incidental catches of
   river herring (Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and Blueback Herring A.
   aestivalis) in commercial fisheries for Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus
   and Atlantic Mackerel Scomber scombrus, but historical information on
   mixed-species catches and their driving factors is lacking. We examined
   data from spring and fall bottom trawl surveys (National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration, Northeast Fisheries Science Center) for
   temporal trends in overlap and potential ecosystem drivers of overlap
   trends. Species overlap changed substantially over time, with changes
   varying by season and region of the northeastern U.S. continental shelf.
   In the fall, changes in overlap were positively related to abundance in
   Georges Bank and southern New England. In the spring, most changes in
   species overlap were positively related to increasing species
   abundances. Positive relationships between overlap and abundance
   suggested that as species distributions increased with abundance,
   distributional overlap with other species increased as well. During the
   fall, changes in species overlap were positively related to bottom
   temperature in the Gulf of Maine, whereas in the spring, the
   relationship with bottom temperature was less consistent.
   Temperature-related changes in overlap implied that species
   distributions changed at different rates in response to climatic
   changes, thus leading to changes in overlap. Our findings suggest that
   fisheries management should take an adaptive approach to managing
   incidental catches by using region- and season-specific policies and
   should incorporate the effects of species abundances and climate change
   on species interactions.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess marine-protected areas' (MPAs)
   effectiveness in the protection of marine mammals. With this purpose,
   the study analyzed the long-term population trend of four different
   species of marine mammals, geographically placed in distant MPAs. In
   addition, matching biophysical and governance indicators were identified
   in order to relate the different management approaches to the biological
   effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the respective MPA. The results show
   population recovery trends, providing empirical evidence that suggests
   the effectiveness of area-based protection measures in marine mammals.
   Moreover, a parallelism between the governance indicators and the
   biophysical ones supports that biological and management effectiveness
   are interrelated. On this basis, the biophysical indicator of human
   impact was discussed to be deeply related to the precautionary
   principle, which appears less efficient than the adaptive management.
   Finally, this study highlights the necessity to better monitor the
   effectiveness of MPAs in order to avoid paper parks and suggest future
   recommendations.},

Title = {Is the development of desalination compatible with sustainable
   development of the Arabian Gulf?},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Number = {A},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The development of desalination has been essential to the rapid economic
   development of the countries bordering the Arabian Gulf. The current
   production capacity of sea water desalination plants drawing water from
   Gulf is over 20 million m(3) day(-1), which may rise to 80 million m(3)
   day(-1) by 2050. Whilst supporting aspects of sustainable development
   related to water and sanitation, desalination impacts the marine
   environment through impingement and entrainment of organisms in intakes,
   and through thermal, brine and chemical discharges. This may compromise
   other objectives for sustainable development related to sustainable use
   of the oceans. Under business as usual scenarios, by 2050, the impact of
   individual desalination plants will combine causing a regional scale
   impact. Without mitigating actions to avoid the business as usual
   scenario, by 2050, desalination in combination with climate change, will
   elevate coastal water temperatures across more than 50\% of the Gulf by
   at least 3 degrees C, and a volume of water equivalent to more than a
   third of the total volume of water between 0 and 10 m deep will pass
   through desalination plants each year. This will adversely impact the
   coastal ecosystem of the Gulf, with impacts on biodiversity, fisheries
   and coastal communities and may cause potential loss of species and
   habitats from the Gulf. Given the significant implications of these
   preliminary findings, and in light of the precautionary approach to
   management, it is recommended that mitigating options addressing
   behavioural, regulatory and technological change are rapidly evaluated
   and implemented to avoid the development of desalination in the region
   along a business as usual pathway, and multidisciplinary research
   studies should be conducted to reduce uncertainty in predictions of
   future impacts.},

Title = {Global connectivity and cross-scale interactions create uncertainty for
   Blue Growth of Arctic fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {321-330},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Arctic faces high expectations of Blue Growth due to future
   projections of easier access and increased biological productivity.
   These expectations are, however, often based on global and regional
   climate change projections and largely ignore the complexity of
   social-ecological interactions taking place across different temporal
   and spatial scales. This paper illustrates how such cross-scale
   interactions at, and across, different dimensions (e.g., ecological,
   socioeconomic and governance) can affect the development of Arctic
   fisheries; and potentially create uncertainties for future Blue Growth
   projections. Two Arctic marine systems, The Barents Sea and the Central
   Arctic Ocean (CAO), are used as focus areas. The former hosts productive
   fisheries and is mostly covered by the EEZs of Norway and Russia, while
   the latter is still mainly covered by sea-ice and is a high seas area
   with no multilevel governance system in place. The examples show that,
   both systems are affected by a number of processes, beyond the
   environmental change, spanning a wide range of dimensions, as well as
   spatial and temporal scales. To address the complexity of the Arctic
   marine systems calls for an increase in holistic scientific
   understanding together with adaptive management practices. This is
   particularly important in the CAO, where no robust regional management
   structures are in place. Recognizing how cross-scale dynamics can cause
   uncertainties to the current fisheries projections and implementing
   well-functioning adaptive management structures across different Arctic
   sub-systems can play a key role in whether the Blue Growth potential in
   Arctic fisheries is realized or lost.},

Pages = {152-161},
Abstract = {East Coast Lows (ECLs) are intense low pressure systems that form
   several times a year off the east coast of Australia. When these systems
   occur close to land they can cause major damage to infrastructure and
   communities due to gale force winds, intense rainfall, storm surge and
   coastal erosion. In June 2007, Newcastle and Central Coast regions of
   New South Wales (NSW) experienced severe weather and subsequent flash
   flooding. The `Pasha Bulker' storm, as it has become known, was one of
   the most significant meteorological events in Australia's history, with
   large economic losses and social disruption due to the loss of critical
   infrastructure. This paper provides background information on the
   meteorology of the event, the impact of the Pasha Bulker storm and a
   discussion of the lessons learned from the event and subsequent
   adaptation strategies employed. The paper also provides important
   reflections, at both regional and national level, on the Pasha Bulker
   storm and other similar storm events. Lessons for all levels of
   government and community groups are discussed, including preparedness
   before the event, actions during the event, and recovery processes
   post-event. From this, recommendations and conclusions are made on
   actions and strategies to increase adaptive capacity and resilience to
   extreme weather events like ECLs.},

Title = {Salmon farming vulnerability to climate change in southern Chile:
   understanding the biophysical, socioeconomic and governance links},

Abstract = {Here, we describe an assessment of climate-change vulnerability for the
   salmon farming sector in southern Chile using a model that combines
   semi-quantitative measures of Exposure (risks), Sensitivity (economic
   and social dependence) and Adaptation Capacity (measures that prevent
   and mitigate impacts). The evaluation was carried out in eight pilot
   communes representative of salmon production (marine grow-out). Exposure
   was estimated with a semi-quantitative risk assessment tool based on
   oceanographic, meteorological and hydrological information,
   mortality-by-cause databases, and through extended consultation with
   experts and relevant stakeholders. Threats included relevant changes in
   water temperature and salinity, declines in dissolved oxygen, occurrence
   of HABs, and diseases that could be associated with climate change.
   Based on our analysis of the data, we divided the farming regions into
   four sub-regions with distinctive oceanographic properties and
   superimposed the sea surface warming trend and a spatial pattern of
   mortality by respective cause. Reduction of precipitation and the
   increase of air and sea surface temperature are the most relevant
   foreseen climate change drivers, especially for regions X and XI. The
   resulting vulnerability matrix indicated that communes with higher
   production concentrations were more exposed, which in some cases
   coincided with higher sensitivity and lower adaptation capacity. Our
   models of four management scenarios allowed us to explore the changes in
   vulnerability associated with a southward movement of salmon production
   towards the Magallanes region. By identifying new protocols to increase
   adaptation and reduce vulnerability in a spatially explicit fashion, we
   provide policy recommendations aimed at increasing climate change
   adaptation and the long-term sustainability of the sector.},

Abstract = {The level of societal risk to hurricane impact is a function of the
   frequency, strength, and duration of landfalling hurricanes, and of the
   degree of preparedness and types of mitigation strategies available to
   and employed by different segments of society. The goals of this book
   are twofold. First, we hope to bring together into one volume the
   state-of-the-art knowledge regarding hurricane variability on different
   time scales (from seasonal to decadal), the status of the current
   hurricane prediction capability (principally in the United States and
   Europe), and to consider some of the science-based implications of
   future climatic variability as it might influence the frequency and
   intensity of these great storms. A second objective is to explore a wide
   range of socioeconomic issues related to historical and recent impacts
   of hurricane activity in the Atlantic, to assess how these
   vulnerabilities may arise in different parts of the affected region (the
   Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and U.S. East Coast), and to highlight the
   possible role of insurance in mitigation strategies. It is possible to
   increase societal vulnerability to a given event with and without
   changes in hurricane frequency. We hope to raise awareness of the
   potential impacts that global climate change may have on the climatology
   of tropical storm systems and to identify what those changes may mean in
   the context of socioeconomic trends and planning in the region.},

Title = {Status quo bias and public policy: evidence in the context of carbon
   mitigation},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article examines whether individuals' preferences for government
   policy are affected by status quo bias. We designed a contingent
   valuation survey that asks respondents directly about their willingness
   to pay (WTP) for their state to be a part of a regional carbon
   mitigation policy. The survey has two randomized frames, which differ in
   whether or not their state is already part of the policy. We distributed
   the survey to a representative sample of Rhode Island residents (N =
   844). We find that respondents who believe that Rhode Island would be
   joining the policy for the first time have a WTP to join of \$170 (quite
   similar to previous research at a national scale), whereas those who
   believe Rhode Island is already part of the policy are willing to pay
   2.5 times more, or \$420, to stay in the program. Our results suggest
   that citizens greatly prefer existing carbon mitigation policies to new
   policies, which implies that carbon policy will be more successful if
   enacted through the legislature instead of popular vote.},

Title = {Climate Change Mitigation Strategy through Membranes Replacement and
   Determination Methodology of Carbon Footprint in Reverse Osmosis RO
   Desalination Plants for Islands and Isolated Territories},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article shows a climate change mitigation strategy by means of
   membranes replacement and determination methodology of carbon footprint
   in reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants, valid for all the islands,
   and even isolated territories in the continent. This study takes the
   case of study of Canary Islands, where there are more than 320
   desalination plants with different sizes, private, and public. The
   objective is to propose a new method which integrates this analysis with
   the replacement of membranes, from 0\% to 20\% per year in sea water
   reverse osmosis desalination plants, to reduce the carbon footprint and
   ecological footprint. If it is considered a replacement of 20\% of the
   elements per year, the carbon footprint could be reduced to between 5\%
   and 6\% and even more if it is introduced low energy consumption
   membranes instead of high rejection elements. The factor mix in Canary
   Islands, according to the technological structure of the generation park
   that uses oil products, is around 0.678 kgCO(2)/kWh, much higher than in
   the Spanish mainland where it is 0.263 kgCO(2)/kWh. Therefore, it is
   estimated in Canary Islands 5,326,963 t CO2/year can be emitted, which
   represents 2.4 tCO(2)/person/year, 12 times more the admissible
   admissions per inhabitant in the Canary Islands, only considering the
   seawater desalination sector. This document shows the different results
   of the analysis of energy efficiency and the environmental footprints.
   This study may serve as a tool for the decision-making processes related
   to how to improve energy efficiency in desalination plants.},

Title = {How to build a heat network to alleviate surface heat island effect?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have proposed cooling measures to mitigate surface
   urban heat island (SUHI) effect from the perspective of landscape
   pattern. However, rare studies have considered to alleviate the SUHI
   from a network perspective, which was demonstrated by first building a
   SUHI network to identify the key nodes and links of a SUHI network and
   subsequently breaking this network to effectively mitigate SUHI. Here, a
   new approach to build SUHI network is proposed, which integrates
   morphological spatial pattern analysis and circuit theory. It includes:
   i) identification of stable and high-risk SUHI patches, ii) extraction
   of the ``core{''} type, iii) evaluation of ``core{''} importance, iv)
   construction of a friction map, and v) generation of links and
   pinch-points. Dongguan city was selected as case and the results showed:
   1) 42 links were identified with 31 pinch points located in these links;
   2) Most of these links and pinch-points were distributed in the
   southwestern and northwestern regions; 3) Cooling measures (patch-based)
   should be implemented in these specific areas to avoid connections
   between the links and nodes that could seriously aggravate the thermal
   environment of entire region. The method and reverse thinking process
   adopted could provide new insights for climate adaption planning and
   urban sustainability.},

Abstract = {In Bangladesh, prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) farming remains
   dependent on the capture of wild postlarvae as hatchery production is
   still inadequate. However, prawn postlarvae fishing has been accompanied
   by concerns over recent climate change. Different climatic variables
   including cyclone, salinity, sea level rise, water temperature, flood,
   rainfall, and drought have had adverse effects on coastal ecosystem,
   thus determining a decline in the availability of prawn postlarvae and
   thereby catch. The households of postlarvae fishers also face a variety
   of socioeconomic constraints due to climate change. Considering extreme
   vulnerability to the effects of climate change, an integrated approach
   needs to be introduced to cope with the challenges. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Ecosystem-Based Disaster Risk Reduction in Indonesia: Unfolding

Booktitle = {DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN INDONESIA: PROGRESS, CHALLENGES, AND ISSUES},
Series = {Disaster Risk Reduction},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {445-467},
Abstract = {The role of ecosystems has been recently acknowledged within the current
   global framework for environmental management, disaster risk reduction,
   climate change adaptation and also sustainable development. The approach
   of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) is promoted as a
   compatible with community inclusiveness and participation, as well as
   cost efficient, socially friendly and sustainable.
   Notwithstanding its acknowledged strengths, Eco-DRR approaches face many
   challenges, including skepticism of its effectiveness towards different
   types and magnitudes of hazards and the complexity to govern such
   effort. In Indonesia, DRR approaches are strongly influenced by the
   spirit of community participation, especially after the 2004 tsunami in
   Aceh and the 2009 earthquake in Padang. We argue that the learning
   process is important to integrate structural and non-structural measures
   by incorporating community involvement in Indonesia, and that Eco-DRR
   Eco-should be promoted, particularly to identify possible opportunities
   to preserve ecosystems and reduce disaster risk.
   The aims of this chapter are to explore the general concept of Eco-DRR,
   to review examples of Eco-DRR projects and to unfold the challenges and
   opportunities for Eco-DRR projects in Indonesia. Data is gathered
   through semi-structured literature reviews and content analysis of
   existing research related to Eco-DRR projects in Indonesia. Demak, a
   coastal area in Central Java Province and the Kuwaru coastal area in
   Yogyakarta Special Province are selected as case studies. The outcome of
   this chapter is a reflection on challenges and opportunities for further
   advancement of Eco-DRR to achieve disaster resilient and sustainable
   communities in Indonesia.},

Title = {Using local and indigenous knowledge in selecting indicators for mapping
   flood vulnerability in informal settlement contexts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Floods have been projected to increase due to climate change and
   informal settlements in developing countries will be the most affected.
   This study presents results of using Local and Indigenous Knowledge in
   selecting indicators for mapping the vulnerability of people to flood
   hazards in an informal settlement context. Using Quarry Road West
   informal settlement, the study employed a convergent parallel
   mixed-methods approach which involved a household survey (n = 359),
   interviews with key informants (n = 8) and a focus group discussion (n =
   1). The study findings reveal that flood vulnerability in the study area
   is not only a result of the proximity of the houses to the Palmiet
   River, the M19 freeway and Quarry Road, but also as a result of the
   nature of the soil and the type of materials people use to build their
   houses. Furthermore, findings reveal that using both Local and
   Indigenous Knowledge possessed by community members, a minimal number
   (sixteen) of context-specific indicators for mapping flood vulnerability
   in the study area were selected. The study also finds that flood
   vulnerability in the study area is a result of physical, socio-economic
   and institutional problems. Therefore, using Local and Indigenous
   Knowledge to select indicators for mapping flood vulnerability helps to
   provide a better understanding of flood vulnerability in an informal
   settlement and this gives decision-makers and other stakeholders a
   glimpse of adaptive measures that can be implemented to increase
   people's resilience.},

Title = {Legal culture and climate change adaptation: An agenda for research},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Abstract = {While climate change adaptation research has increasingly focused on
   aspects of culture, a systematic treatment of the role of legal culture
   in how communities respond to climate risk has yet to be produced. This
   is despite the fact that law and legal authority are implicated in most,
   if not all, of the ways in which actors seek to reduce the risks posed
   to communities by climate change. Using a scoping review methodology,
   this article examines the intersection of climate change adaptation and
   legal culture in existing research. Overall, we find that the
   significance of legal culture for adaptation actions has been
   under-explored. Yet, it is also clear that a focus on legal culture
   holds significant promise for our understanding of climate change
   adaptation. We set out a research agenda for the field, highlighting the
   ways in which a focus on legal culture may enrich existing key themes
   within climate change adaptation research.This article is categorized

Abstract = {Climate change is causing shifts in marine species' distributions,
   disrupting fishers and fishing communities and threatening food
   security. These changes affect all fishing activities, from small-scale
   to industrial fishing, and have implications for livelihoods, economies,
   and society along the entire seafood supply chain. Understanding
   fisheries as social-ecological systems (SESs) that include dynamic
   responses and feedbacks for the targeted stocks, the fishers, and the
   fishing industry provides an essential standpoint for thinking about
   fisheries' adaptation to climate change. In this Perspective, we briefly
   summarize the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of target species'
   distribution shifts. We propose using a resilience perspective where
   fishery SESs can respond to climate changes by maintaining, coping,
   adapting, and/or transforming the system. In this context, we identify
   what specific actions by individuals, groups, and institutions allow the
   fishery system to respond in these ways and discuss policy solutions to
   allow for adaptation and transformation to shifting species
   distributions.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {131},
Number = {2},
Pages = {349-361},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion, salt-water intrusion, and flooding due to sea-level
   rise threaten to degrade critical coastal strand and wetland habitats.
   Because habitat loss is a measure of the risk of extinction, managers
   are keen for guidance to reduce risk posed by sea-level rise. Building
   upon standard inundation mapping techniques and suitability mapping, we
   develop a ranking system that models sea-level rise vulnerability as a
   function of six input parameters defined by wetland experts: type of
   inundation, time of inundation, soil type, habitat value,
   infrastructure, and coastal erosion. We apply this model under the
   mid-century and end-of-century RCP8.5 sea-level projection (0.30 m by
   2057, and 0.74 m by 2100) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. To demonstrate this method, the
   model is applied to three coastal wetlands on the Hawaiian islands of
   Maui and O'ahu. Each ranked input parameter is mapped upon a 2 m
   horizontal resolution raster and final vulnerability is obtained by
   calculating the weighted geometric mean of the input vulnerability
   scores. Areas that ranked with the `highest' vulnerability should be the
   focus of future management efforts. The tools developed in this study
   can be a guide to prioritize conservation actions at flooded areas and
   initiate decisions to adaptively manage sea-level rise impacts.},

Title = {Tropical cyclone risk perception and risk reduction analysis for coastal
   Bangladesh: Household and expert perspectives},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Risk assessment as well as risk perceptions play a vital role in
   disaster risk reduction through formulating and implementing disaster
   risk reduction (DRR) policies and interventions. This study, which was
   conducted in the coastal areas of Bangladesh, aims to: firstly, analyze
   actual versus perceived cyclone risk at household level in the coastal
   communities of Bangladesh; secondly, investigate experts' perceptions of
   perceived cyclone risk; and thirdly, explore cyclone risk reduction
   (CRR) strategies from both expert and household perspectives. An
   extensive survey consisting of face-to-face questionnaire surveys and
   site observation was undertaken in the southern coastal areas of
   Bangladesh. Both actual and perceived risk values varied significantly
   among the three study areas (Lalua, Burigoalini and Koyra). These risks
   vary according to participants' income, occupation, farm size, gender,
   geographical location, and educational attainment/qualification. Results
   indicate the average level of perceived risk is high both at the
   household and expert level. Female participants perceive slightly higher
   risk than males in coastal Bangladesh. This survey advocates some
   cyclone risk reduction (CRR) measures, as follows: build more cyclone
   shelters and cyclone resilient privately owned houses; build or improve
   embankments and polders; build or improve roads; preserve dry food;
   supply adequate food and pure drinking water; and improve the quality of
   early warning messages or alarms. This study concludes that risk
   perception assessment is a prerequisite for implementing any risk
   reduction plan or strategy, and it is critical to integrate bottom-up
   and top-down approaches for CRR plans and actions.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on the agricultural systems of three major
   islands in the Mediterranean basin, namely Sicily, Crete and Cyprus, was
   evaluated using a suite of specifically calibrated crop models and the
   outputs of a regional circulation model for Representative Concentration
   Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 downscaled to 12 km of resolution and tested
   for its effectiveness in reproducing the local meteorological data. The
   most important annual (wheat, barley, tomato and potato) and perennial
   (grapevine and olive tree) crops were selected to represent the
   agricultural systems of the islands. The same modelling framework was
   used to test the effectiveness of autonomous adaptation options, such as
   shifting sowing date and the use of varieties with different growing
   season length. The results highlighted that, on average, warmer
   temperatures advanced both anthesis and maturity of the selected crops,
   but at different magnitudes depending on the crop and the island. Winter
   crops (barley, wheat and potato) experienced the lowest impact in terms
   of yield loss with respect to the baseline, with even some positive
   effects, especially in Sicily where both wheat and barley showed a
   general increase of 9\% as compared to the baseline, while potato
   increased up to + 17\%. Amongst perennial crops, olive tree showed low
   variation under RCP 4.5, but on average increased by 7\% under RCP 8.5
   on the three islands. Climate change had a detrimental effect
   specifically on tomato (- 2\% on average in RCP 8.5 and 4.5 on the three
   islands) and grapevine (- 7\%). The use of different sowing dates, or
   different varieties, revealed that for winter crops early autumn sowing
   is still the best option for producing wheat and barley in future
   periods on the three islands under both future scenarios. For tomato and
   potato, advancing sowing date to early winter is a winning strategy that
   may even increase final yield (+ 9\% for tomato and + 17\% for potato,
   on average). For grapevine, the use of late varieties, while suffering
   the most from increasing temperatures and reduced rainfall (- 15\%, on
   average), is still a valuable option to keep high yield levels with
   respect to earlier varieties, which even if showing some increases with
   respect to the baseline have a generally much lower production level.
   The same may be applied to olive tree although the production
   differences between late and early varieties are less evident and
   climate change exerts a favourable influence (+ 4 and + 3\% for early
   and late varieties, respectively).},

Abstract = {As part of a broad assessment of climate change impacts in Morocco, an
   assessment of vulnerability and adaptation of coastal zones to sea-level
   rise was conducted. Tangier Bay which is the most important
   socioeconomic pole in Nor-them Morocco represents one of the cases
   studies. Using a GIS-based inundation analysis and an erosion modelling
   approach, the potential physical vulnerability to accelerated sea-level
   rise was investigated, and the most vulnerable socio-economic sectors
   were assessed. Results indicate that 10\% and 24\% of the area will be
   at risk of flooding respectively for minimum (4 m) and maximum (11 m)
   inundation levels. The most severely impacted sectors are expected to be
   the coastal defences and the port, the urban area, tourist coastal
   infrastructures, the railway, and the industrial area. Shoreline erosion
   would affect nearly 20\% and 45\% of the total beach areas respectively
   in 2050 and 2100. Potential response strategies and adaptation options
   identified include: sand dune fixation, beach nourishment and building
   of seawalls to protect the urban and industrial areas of high value. It
   was also recommended that an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan for
   the region, including upgrading awareness, building regulation and urban
   growth planning should be the most appropriate tool to ensure a
   long-term sustainable development, while addressing the vulnerability of
   the coast to future sea-level rise. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Throughout history, human beings have been attracted to waterfront
   living. Today, most residents live in cities, most of which, in turn,
   are built on flood plains and in coastal areas - areas often threatened
   by floods. Physical changes to the environment have changed the response
   of catchments and rivers to heavy rainfall. Despite attempts to control
   the size of floods, economic growth - especially as experienced in Asia
   - has led to an explosion in exposure to floods. The most integrated,
   cost-effective method for disaster reduction and prevention requires
   that risk be assessed purposefully and adequately. Disaster risk is
   captured in two major components: occurrence probability and event
   intensity and reach, and its consequences. Understanding the risks
   associated with floods in Asia has been hindered by the complexity of
   flood dynamics in large river basins and in existing or unreliable
   datasets. With calculation power increasingly available, the development
   of flexible modeling systems and the appearance of new datasets,
   so-called probabilistic flood models can now be developed for large
   areas to quantify risks. A flexible modeling framework has been
   developed at DHI to better characterize flood plains and complex
   hydraulic systems in datapoor and highly exposed areas in Asia. The
   model relies on automated processes merging freely available datasets
   such as HydroSHEDS, WorldPop, crowd-sourced data available in OpenStreet
   Map and Landsat 7 and 8 satellite imagery. The combination of spatial
   data sources provides opportunities to optimize the hydrodynamic model
   domain and to improve the lowresolution digital elevation model. Such
   methods enhance flood hazard information conventionally derived from
   deterministic models by taking a full probabilistic approach considering
   source loading conditions, e.g., weather events and sea level rise, and
   the performance of existing and planned mitigation measures and failures
   of control structures such as dykes. With risks better quantified, new
   opportunities arise for cost-effective mitigation and resilience
   measures and for the development of novel risk transfer schemes through
   the use of insurance and capital markets.},

Title = {A Vulnerability Assessment in Scant Data Context: The Case of North Horr
   Sub-County},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Kenyan rural areas belonging to the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs),
   water quantity and water quality are major issues for the local
   population. In North Horr Sub-County water quality is threatened by
   nitrate contamination due to fecal matter pollution. This research,
   hence, aims at assessing the vulnerability of open shallow water sources
   to nitrate contamination due to fecal intrusion following flooding
   events and nitrate percolation in groundwater. The present research,
   indeed, provides, on one hand, new insights into the analysis of the
   vulnerability in a scant data context; on the other hand, it assesses
   the adaptation measures contained in the local development plan.
   Applying the reference definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC), the results demonstrate that the open shallow
   water sources in the northern part of the sub-county are more vulnerable
   to nitrate contamination. Furthermore, the consistency of the results
   proves the suitability of the methodology selected. Understanding the
   vulnerability at the local scale is key to planning risk-reduction
   strategies as well to increasing the local population's knowledge about
   flood-related risks and water quality.},

Title = {Applying Principles of Uncertainty within Coastal Hazard Assessments to
   Better Support Coastal Adaptation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal hazards result from erosion of the shore, or flooding of
   low-elevation land when storm surges combine with high tides and/or
   large waves. Future sea-level rise will greatly increase the frequency
   and depth of coastal flooding and will exacerbate erosion and raise
   groundwater levels, forcing vulnerable communities to adapt.
   Communities, local councils and infrastructure operators will need to
   decide when and how to adapt. The process of decision making using
   adaptive pathways approaches, is now being applied internationally to
   plan for adaptation over time by anticipating tipping points in the
   future when planning objectives are no longer being met. This process
   requires risk and uncertainty considerations to be transparent in the
   scenarios used in adaptive planning. We outline a framework for
   uncertainty identification and management within coastal hazard
   assessments. The framework provides a logical flow from the land use
   situation, to the related level of uncertainty as determined by the
   situation, to which hazard scenarios to model, to the complexity level
   of hazard modeling required, and to the possible decision type.
   Traditionally, coastal flood hazard maps show inundated areas only. We
   present enhanced maps of flooding depth and frequency which clearly show
   the degree of hazard exposure, where that exposure occurs, and how the
   exposure changes with sea-level rise, to better inform adaptive planning
   processes. The new uncertainty framework and mapping techniques can
   better inform identification of trigger points for adaptation pathways
   planning and their expected time range, compared to traditional coastal
   flooding hazard assessments.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Coastal island communities face significant risks associated with
   increased natural hazards and other impacts associated with climate
   change. Further, deeply rooted social issues, lack of awareness or
   information, and inadequate infrastructure and planning may exacerbate
   risks to island socio-ecological systems. Understanding these
   relationships is often difficult, given the lack of methods available
   for communities to explicitly explore anticipated risks and potential
   adaptation strategies, in relation to the characteristics of their
   community socio-ecological system. Social learning has also been shown
   to foster adaptation to environmental changes, build social trust and
   empower diverse stakeholders, by offering opportunities for groups of
   individuals to challenge, negotiate and propose new norms, policies or
   programs. We present a three-phase social learning framework to
   facilitate stakeholder-driven scenario-based modeling, in order to
   inform community disaster planning in relation to the potential impacts
   of a tsunami. The participatory research was conducted in conjunction
   with a community disaster committee, representing the communities of the
   North Shore of O'ahu, Hawai'i. Through a series of iterative
   participatory modeling workshops using fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping,
   the community committee represented, explored and actively questioned
   their beliefs about the natural hazards that their community faces.
   Further, the modeling process allowed the committee to represent the
   communities' dynamic nature, run tsunami hazard scenarios to quantify
   potential direct and indirect effects, and explicitly compare trade-offs
   of competing adaptation strategies. Changes in the committee's model
   representations that took place over time demonstrate a progression
   through single-, double- and triple-loop learning, indicating that
   social learning occurred across individual to institutional levels, and
   over short- to longterm time scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Differential residential perspectives on in situ protection and retreat
   as strategies for climate adaptation},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Number = {3-4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The growing cost of climate-driven coastal impacts requires an improved
   understanding of how coastal populations engage with adaptation
   decisions. While many studies explore factors driving coastal
   adaptation, generally, few evaluate how residents consider relationships
   between in situ, protective adaption vs. retreat from at-risk areas.
   What is the relationship between residents' exposure, perceptions of
   climate trends, and concerns about the future? How do these factors
   influence openness to different adaption strategies? Are these
   strategies considered to be progressive-where protection is indexed to
   minor threats and retreat occurs when protection measures fail-or are
   these dichotomous choices? We apply structural equation modeling to
   evaluate these decision pathways using a 2017 household survey in North
   Carolina's (USA) Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula (n = 147). Our results
   reveal that residents commonly view protection and retreat as mutually
   exclusive, rather than progressive, methods for reducing risk, and that
   their preferences are correlated with different understandings of
   climate threats.},

Abstract = {The knowledge of how shrub-seedling interactions vary with summer
   drought, canopy opening, and tree species is crucial for adapting forest
   management to climate change.
   The aim of this study was to assess variation in shrub-oak recruitment
   associations along a south-north drought climate gradient and between
   two levels of canopy cover in coastal dune forest communities in a
   climate change-adapted forest management perspective.
   Mapped data of associational patterns of seedlings of three oak species
   with interspecific pooled shrubs were analyzed using a bivariate pair
   correlation function in 10 (0.315 ha) regeneration plots located in
   forest and recent gap sites along the climate gradient. An index of
   association strength was calculated in each plot and plotted against a
   summer moisture index.
   The association strength increased with increasing summer drought from
   wet south to dry north and from closed forests to gaps.
   Consistent with facilitation theory, our results suggest that climate
   change may shift associational patterns in coastal dune forest
   communities towards more positive associations, in particular in canopy
   gaps. In a perspective of climate change, foresters may need to conserve
   understory shrubs in gaps in order to promote oak species regeneration.},

Title = {Co-management policy can reduce resilience in traditionally managed
   marine ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {951-966},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Best-practice environmental policy often suggests co-management of
   marine resources as a means of achieving sustainable development. Here
   we consider the impacts of superimposing co-management policy, in the
   form of territorial user rights for fishers over an existing traditional
   community-based natural-resource management system in Chile. We consider
   a broad definition of co-management that includes a spectrum of
   arrangements between governments and user groups described by different
   levels of devolution of power. We used participatory rural appraisal
   techniques and questionnaires to understand the mechanisms that underpin
   the traditional management system for the bull-kelp ``cochayuyo{''}
   (Durvillaea antarctica). Traditional management was based on the
   allocation of informal access rights through a lottery system. This
   system was controlled by a complex web of traditional institutions that
   were shown to be successful in terms of equity and resilience. Using a
   similar approach, we analyzed the effects of superimposing a
   government-led co-management policy into this traditional system. Two
   major effects of the new policy were encountered. First, traditional
   institutions were weakened, which had negative effects on the levels of
   trust within the community and intensified conflict among users. Second,
   the management system's adaptive capacity was reduced, thereby
   jeopardizing the ecosystem's resilience. Our results suggest that the
   devolution of power to this kind of fisher community still has not
   reached the level required for fishers to legally address the local
   deficiencies of the Chilean co-management policy. Additionally, legal
   adjustments must be made to accommodate traditionally managed ecosystems
   that offer benefits comparable to those mandated under the formal
   policy. A fuller understanding of the interactions between co-management
   and traditional institutions can help us to identify ways to promote
   resilience and facilitate equal access by mitigating the potential
   negative effects of co-management policy and informing its future
   implementation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {62-75},

Abstract = {The increased number of natural hazards due to climate variability has
   resulted in numerous disasters in developing countries. In the
   Philippines, these are expected to be more common in coastal areas. The
   common approach to mitigate disasters in this area is to enhance the
   inherent capabilities of local communities to reduce the effects. Thus,
   this study proposed an index for a disaster-resilient coastal community
   at the local level. The composites of the index were determined through
   a process of prioritizing national-level components of a risk-management
   and vulnerability-reduction system. The process followed a Delphi
   technique, wherein 20 decision makers in Baler, Aurora, the Philippines
   identified criteria and elements that can be used to reduce the
   vulnerability of coastal communities using paired comparisons for the
   Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results showed that the
   environmental and natural resource management, sustainable livelihood,
   social protection, and planning regimes were very important and
   represented >= 70\% of the overall weights of criteria subjected to
   comparisons. These criteria and their elements represented the
   local-level outcome indicators of the composite index for a
   disaster-resilient coastal community, which was measured using a
   weighted linear average (WLC) approach to both outcome and process
   indicators. The index could be used by local governments as a tool to
   facilitate meaningful disaster-risk reduction and management. (C) 2012

Title = {Integrated machine learning and GIS-based bathtub models to assess the
   future flood risk in the Kapuas River Delta, Indonesia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS},
Abstract = {As more and more people live near the sea, future flood risk must be
   properly assessed for sustainable urban planning and coastal protection.
   However, this is rarely the case in developing countries where there is
   both lack of in-situ data collection and forecasting tools. Here, we
   consider the case of the Kapuas River delta (KRD), a data-scarce delta
   on the west coast of Borneo Island, Indonesia. We assessed future flood
   risk under three climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5).
   We combined the multiple linear regression and the GIS-based bathtub
   inundation models to assess the future flood risk. The former model was
   implemented to model the river's water-level dynamics in the KRD,
   particularly in Pontianak, under the influence of rainfall changes,
   surface wind changes, and sea-level rise. The later model created flood
   maps with inundated areas under a 100-year flood scenario, representing
   Pontianak's current and future flood extent. We found that about
   6.4\%-11.9\% more buildings and about 6.8\%-12.7\% more roads will be
   impacted by a 100-year flood in 2100. Our assessment guides the local
   water manager in preparing adequate flood mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Desalination and environment: A critical analysis of impacts, mitigation
   strategies, and greener desalination technologies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {780},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The desalination of seawater is perceived as one of the most viable
   processes to fulfill the mounting demand for freshwater. Despite
   enormous economic, social, and health benefits offered by desalination,
   there are several concerns regarding its prospective environmental
   impacts (EIs). The objective of this work is to critically evaluate the
   potential EIs of seawater desalination, and assess the prospects of
   greener desalination. The EIs of desalination on marine environment,
   land, groundwater, and air quality was systematically reviewed. An
   attempt has been made to analyze the actuality of these so-called
   impacts with reference to evidence from real desalination plants. The
   mitigative measures to counterbalance these unfavorable impacts are
   critically appraised. Furthermore, the brine management technologies for
   the disposal of reject stream, the recovery of precious materials and
   water, and the production of useful chemicals are also reviewed. Current
   challenges to minimize the adverse impacts of desalination and prospects
   of sustainable greener desalination to overwhelm global water scarcities
   are also discussed. The current desalination approaches have moderate
   and minor negative EIs. However, with proper mitigation and utilization
   of modern technologies, these impacts can be lessened. Furthermore, by
   employing various modern techniques, reject brine can be utilized for
   several useful applications while reducing its adverse impacts
   simultaneously. Recent advancements in desalination technologies have
   also offered many alternative approaches that provide a roadmap towards
   greener desalination. This review article will be beneficial for all the
   stakeholders in the desalination industry.

Abstract = {Urbanisation in PICs is rapid. Urban planning and management capacity
   are limited. Economic and environmental pressures are mounting and
   eroding urban resilience and livelihoods. Because urban planning and
   regulatory frameworks are weak, national politics and elite interests
   strongly influence urban development, and inequities in cities are
   growing. No regional organisation has responsibility for urban issues,
   urban resilience frameworks are poorly defined, so fragmented and
   ineffective urban strategies persist, while national policies and
   practices are resolutely anti-urban. Concerted regional action could
   enable sharing of knowledge and successful strategies, coordinate urban
   action to build resilience, and enable a more proactive political and
   policy agendas for more sustainable and resilient cities.},

Title = {Storm surge disaster risk management: the Xynthia case study in France},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Pages = {825-841},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, a series of catastrophic storm surges have occurred in
   Europe. The large number of fatalities and high material damage are
   mainly due to an increase in vulnerability and exposure to coastal
   flooding of hit regions. It is, therefore, necessary to intensify
   research activities in order to better understand this kind of
   disasters, to reduce their impacts and to reinforce risk management.
   This study describes the consequences of Xynthia windstorm that hit
   France in 2010: strong wind gusts, associated to high-coefficient tides
   and very low pressure, caused a phenomenon of storm surge in the
   Atlantic coastal area of France. Sea walls, lacking maintenance and
   originally built to defend agricultural land, were not able to protect
   houses. Fourty-seven people were killed, most of them from drowning, and
   direct losses amounted to more than 2.5billion Euros. Around 10,000
   people were forced to evacuate after the inundation of their properties.
   Uncontrolled urbanization was involved in the increase of stakes, as
   demonstrated by the fact that all the 29 victims in the city of la
   Faute-sur-Mer were living in houses built after 1980. The paper
   describes the event considering the aspect of increased vulnerability in
   the affected area, the lack of preparedness that exacerbated the final
   damage, the emergency response phases and the adaptation strategies
   adopted by the French Government after the disaster. We conclude that an
   attentive governance should include a balanced approach to risk
   protection, to reduce vulnerability and exposure.},

Abstract = {A key criterion of successful adaptation to climate change is that it
   avoids potential inequalities arising from climate impacts or from
   adaptation strategies themselves. Recent research on adaptation in
   developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such
   fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and
   should be situated in the milieu of people's daily lives and
   temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this
   theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents
   findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived
   values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in
   Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research
   finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second
   homeowners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of
   these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their
   needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may
   be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place
   attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time
   to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the
   best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of
   place-specific and people centric values for achieving fair adaptation.

Title = {All roads lead to retreat: adapting to sea level rise using a
   trigger-based pathway},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN PLANNER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {182-190},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {As coastal communities all over the world deal with the consequences of
   rising sea-level and more intense storm events, planners and managers
   continue to grapple with the optimal policy approach to managing
   increasing risks to coastal ecosystems, people and property. In this
   article, we describe a flexible pathway approach to adaptation derived
   in south west Australia for local government. While the issue is usually
   addressed using a conventional option analysis of the
   `retreat-accommodate-protect' alternatives within a given timeframe
   (often until 2100), we argue that this approach is misleading in that it
   obfuscates the long term realities of climate change. Sea-level will be
   rising for hundreds if not thousands of years, meaning that retreat is
   ultimately inevitable for any coastlines currently determined to be
   vulnerable - the only uncertainty is when this will be necessary.
   Accordingly the focus should be on continual monitoring, updated hazard
   mapping, and the identification of sequential triggers that regulate
   land uses. We propose this simplified flexible pathway as a rational
   approach to dealing with the temporal uncertainty of future climate
   change that should be widely adopted.},

Abstract = {Natural disaster vulnerability can intuitively reflect the
   susceptibility of an area to environmental changes. Better understanding
   the spatial distribution of natural disaster vulnerability is a critical
   process for taking effective adaptation and management. Although
   significant achievements have been made in disaster vulnerability, few
   studies are known about natural disaster vulnerability at the national
   scale, especially from the typical natural disaster events in China. In
   this study, with normalizing selected indicators and calculating
   vulnerability index, we analyzed the spatial distribution of natural
   disasters vulnerability during 2010-2017 using the geospatial
   techniques. The results showed that natural disaster vulnerability has
   certain spatial differences, but different natural disaster can occur in
   the same area during the study period. Drought disaster can occur in all
   regions of China, especially in Inner Mongolia. Flood disaster is mainly
   concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and
   the Yellow River Basin. The wind and storm disaster is chiefly in the
   northern regions in China. The freezing disaster is widely distributed
   in China. Furthermore, the regions with low vulnerability were primarily
   distributed in the eastern coastal region, indicating that the rapid
   development of economy and technology can resist or mitigate natural
   disaster to a certain extent. This study offers a solution to study
   natural disasters and provides scientific basis for disaster prevention
   and mitigation actions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {209-221},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Communities worldwide face dangers due to floods induced by natural
   events or technical failures. These vulnerabilities are increasing due
   to continued settlement along coastlines and in floodplains, and may be
   exacerbated in future by climate change. Flood losses can be mitigated
   via structural and nonstructural (or community based) means. Risk
   analysis can be undertaken on behalf of different stakeholders
   including: policy makers or regulatory bodies; asset owners; the local
   community; and individuals who live, work or recreate in the hazard
   impact zones. While methods exist for assessing the risks associated
   with water impoundment and control structures, less effort has been
   devoted to developing methods that can assess the merits of
   community-based preparation and response activities such as evacuation
   and sheltering in place. There is a need to identify the best approaches
   for undertaking assessments of proposed plans, and to explore
   opportunities for adapting existing models to provide these
   capabilities. This paper posits the challenge of assessing nonstructural
   approaches in the context of existing risk analysis methods, proposes a
   possible direction for developing new methods of analysis, and then
   demonstrates the application of the proposed methods in support of
   planning for near-field tsunami hazards along the Pacific coast of North

Title = {Regime shifts and management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {15-22},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Regime shifts are substantial reorganizations in system structure,
   functions and feedbacks, which can lead to changes in the provision of
   ecosystem services with significant impacts on human well-being. Recent
   research has documented cases of regime shifts in local and regional
   systems and there is mounting concern about regime shifts of global
   significance. In this paper we discuss management of social-ecological
   systems in light of the potential for regime shift. Management that
   increases system resilience and lowers the probability of regime shifts
   is beneficial when regime shifts are likely to reduce human well-being.
   It may not always be possible to avoid harmful regime shifts, so
   building capacity to adapt should a regime shift occur is beneficial
   too. Adaptive management can help reduce uncertainty about the
   likelihood of regime shifts, how this likelihood can be affected by
   management action, and the impact of regime shifts on well-being.
   Linking scientific understanding with decision-making is important but
   distributional consequences can impede decision making and action. (C)

Abstract = {Aims Fourteen percent of all living coral, equivalent to more than all
   the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, has died in the past decade as a
   result of climate change-driven bleaching. Inspired by the `oxidative
   stress theory of coral bleaching', we investigated whether a bacterial
   consortium designed to scavenge free radicals could integrate into the
   host microbiome and improve thermal tolerance of the coral model,
   Exaiptasia diaphana. Methods and Results E. diaphana anemones were
   inoculated with a consortium of high free radical scavenging (FRS)
   bacteria, a consortium of congeneric low FRS bacteria, or sterile
   seawater as a control, then exposed to elevated temperature. Increases
   in the relative abundance of Labrenzia during the first 2 weeks
   following the last inoculation provided evidence for temporary inoculum
   integration into the E. diaphana microbiome. Initial uptake of other
   consortium members was inconsistent, and these bacteria did not persist
   either in E. diaphana's microbiome over time. Given their
   non-integration into the host microbiome, the ability of the FRS
   consortium to mitigate thermal stress could not be assessed.
   Importantly, there were no physiological impacts (negative or positive)
   of the bacterial inoculations on the holobiont. Conclusions The
   introduced bacteria were not maintained in the anemone microbiome over
   time, thus, their protective effect is unknown. Achieving long-term
   integration of bacteria into cnidarian microbiomes remains a research
   priority. Significance and Impact of the Study Microbiome engineering
   strategies to mitigate coral bleaching may assist coral reefs in their
   persistence until climate change has been curbed. This study provides
   insights that will inform microbiome manipulation approaches in coral
   bleaching mitigation research.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {World fisheries, already vulnerable, are under increasing pressure from
   the impacts of climate change. Using the Tasmanian rock lobster industry
   as a case study, we considered the efficacy of risk perception as a tool
   to inform how to communicate the science of climate change and
   suggestions for management in relation to development of adaptation
   strategies for fisheries. Fishers surveyed in this study operate in a
   fishery that is expected to undergo large changes as a consequence of
   climate change. Fishers also reported observations of similar large
   changes in the marine environment and lobster fishery consistent with
   climate change: yet most fishers surveyed expressed doubts about whether
   climate change was a real process. The important point for adaption of
   the industry to climate change is that fisher perceptions of risk tended
   to create barriers to acceptance of climate change as an issue. This
   means that there is a barrier to communication and awareness about
   climate change and thus a barrier to future action on the issue.
   Improving acceptance of climate change and thus ability to adapt will
   require the development of communications that are culturally
   appropriate and palatable to fishers. We argue that the application of
   social learning principles in communications about climate change may be
   one constructive way forward. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Projecting climate change, drought conditions and crop productivity in
   Turkey},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1, 29},
Pages = {175-191},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the evaluation of regional climate model
   simulation for Turkey for the 21st century. A regional climate model,
   ICTP-RegCM3, with 20 km horizontal resolution, is used to downscale the
   reference and future climate scenario (IPCC-A2) simulations.
   Characteristics of droughts as well as the crop growth and yields of
   first- and second-crop corn are then calculated and simulated based on
   the data produced. The model projects an increase in air temperature of
   5 to 7 degrees C during the summer season over the west and an increase
   of 3.5 degrees C for the winter season for the eastern part of the
   country. Precipitation is predicted to be 40\% less in the southwest,
   although it may increase by 25\% in the eastern part of the Black Sea
   region and north eastern Turkey. Trends in drought intensity and crop
   growth are related to climate changes. The results suggest more
   frequent, intense and long-lasting droughts in the country particularly
   along the western and southern coasts under future climate conditions. A
   shift of climate classes towards drier conditions is also projected for
   the western, southern and central regions during the 21st century.
   Evaluating the role of the climate change trends in crop production
   reveals significant decreases in yield and shortened growth seasons for
   first-and second-crop corn, a likely result of high temperatures and
   water stresses. In addition to rising temperatures and declining
   precipitation, increasing frequency, severity and duration of drought
   events may significantly affect food production and socio-economic
   conditions in Turkey. Our results may help policy makers and relevant
   sectors to implement appropriate and timely measures to cope with
   climate-change-induced droughts and their effects in the future.},

   Mitigate the Joint Effects of Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) will magnify the impacts of storm surge; the
   resulting severe flooding and inundation can cause huge damage to
   coastal communities. Community leaders are considering implementing
   adaptation strategies, typically hard engineering projects, to protect
   coastal assets and resources. It is important to understand the costs
   and benefits of the proposed project before any decision is made. To
   mitigate the flooding impact of joint effects of storm surge and SLR,
   building levee segments is chosen to be a corresponding adaptation
   strategy to protect the real estate assets in the study area-the City of
   Miami, FL, USA. This paper uses the classic Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)
   to assess the cost efficiency and proposes corresponding improvements in
   the benefit estimation, by estimating the avoided damages of
   implementing levee projects. Results show that the city will benefit
   from implementing levee projects along the Miami River in both a
   one-time 10 year storm event with SLR and cumulative long-term damage
   scenarios. This study also suggests that conducting CBA is a critical
   process before making coastal adaptation planning investment. A more
   meaningful result of cost effectiveness is estimated by accounting for
   the appreciation and time value. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is
   conducted to verify how the choice of discount rate influences the
   result. Uncertain factors including the rate of SLR, storm
   intensification, land use changes, and real estate appreciation are
   further analyzed.},

Abstract = {The challenge faced by government, industry, and the community is to
   plan for and manage the use of our marine environment in an ecologically
   sustainable manner. Marine planning is a new concept for managing
   ecologically sustainable development and use in South Australian marine
   waters. A marine planning framework has been developed to provide for
   the delivery of six plans, based on ecological zoning arrangements,
   covering state waters in South Australia's eight marine bioregions. The
   model for the framework has been developed on the principles of
   ecosystem-based management, ecologically sustainable development, and
   adaptive management. Fundamental to this framework is an ecologically
   based zoning model that defines areas according to marine, coastal, and
   estuarine habitats and species identified as suitable indicators of
   ecosystem integrity. Each zone is supported by goals, objectives, and
   strategies for use and development in order to protect the integrity of
   these ecosystems.},

Title = {Evaluation of Future Streamflow in the Upper Part of the Nilwala River
   Basin (Sri Lanka) under Climate Change},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change is a serious and complex crisis that impacts humankind in
   different ways. It affects the availability of water resources,
   especially in the tropical regions of South Asia to a greater extent.
   However, the impact of climate change on water resources in Sri Lanka
   has been the least explored. Noteworthy, this is the first study in Sri
   Lanka that attempts to evaluate the impact of climate change in
   streamflow in a watershed located in the southern coastal belt of the
   island. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the climate change
   impact on streamflow of the Upper Nilwala River Basin (UNRB), Sri Lanka.
   In this study, the bias-corrected rainfall data from three Regional
   Climate Models (RCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways
   (RCPs): RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were fed into the Hydrologic Engineering
   Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model to obtain future
   streamflow. Bias correction of future rainfall data in the Nilwala River
   Basin (NRB) was conducted using the Linear Scaling Method (LSM). Future
   precipitation was projected under three timelines: 2020s (2021-2047),
   2050s (2048-2073), and 2080s (2074-2099) and was compared against the
   baseline period from 1980 to 2020. The ensemble mean annual
   precipitation in the NRB is expected to rise by 3.63\%, 16.49\%, and
   12.82\% under the RCP 4.5 emission scenario during the 2020s, 2050s, and
   2080s, and 4.26\%, 8.94\%, and 18.04\% under RCP 8.5 emission scenario
   during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The future annual
   streamflow of the UNRB is projected to increase by 59.30\% and 65.79\%
   under the ensemble RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, respectively,
   when compared to the baseline scenario. In addition, the seasonal flows
   are also expected to increase for both RCPs for all seasons with an
   exception during the southwest monsoon season in the 2015-2042 period
   under the RCP4.5 emission scenario. In general, the results of the
   present study demonstrate that climate and streamflow of the NRB are
   expected to experience changes when compared to current climatic
   conditions. The results of the present study will be of major importance
   for river basin planners and government agencies to develop sustainable
   water management strategies and adaptation options to offset the
   negative impacts of future changes in climate.},

Abstract = {People are directly and indirectly exposed to changing weather patterns
   through changes in the quality of water, air, and food changes in
   ecosystems, agriculture, industry, human settlements and the economy.
   Hence, this study explored local perceived reasons for safe drinking
   water scarcity and under such circumstances the coping responses in
   their region. This is a descriptive study based on qualitative methods.
   Male and female informants (30 + years of age) were purposively
   identified and data for the study were collected in three ways, through
   observation and informal discussion, in-depth interviews (n = 18), and
   three focus group discussions in a coastal village of Bangladesh.
   Climate change consequences include damaged trees and increased salinity
   intrusion, leading to a scarcity of safe drinking water. To cope with
   such scarcity of water, small scale road side mangrove tree planting was
   found to protect fresh water from salt water. In addition, cost
   effective rainwater preservation in the community during the rainy
   season was taken as mitigation of the scarcity of safe drinking water.
   Considering the geographical and socio-economic context of any specific
   region, cost effective and environment friendly local adaptive measures
   can reduce or mitigate the impact of climate change on water resources.},

Volume = {29},
Pages = {109-142},
Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies remove carbon dioxide from
   flue gases for storage in geologic formations or the ocean. We find that
   CCS is technically feasible, with current costs of about \$200 to \$250
   per ton of carbon. Although currently a relatively expensive mitigation
   option, CCS could be attractive if we have a stringent carbon policy, if
   CCS turns out unexpectedly inexpensive relative to other options, or if
   it is otherwise desired to retain fossil fuels as part of the energy mix
   while reducing carbon emissions. Near-term prospects favor CCS for
   electric power plants and certain industrial sources with storage in
   depleted oil and gas reservoirs as opposed to aquifers. Deep aquifers
   may provide an attractive longer-term-storage option, whereas ocean
   storage poses greater technical and environmental uncertainty. CCS
   should be seriously considered for addressing climate change, alongside
   energy efficiency and carbon-free energy, although significant
   environmental, technical, and political uncertainties and obstacles
   remain.},

Title = {Assessing local climate vulnerability and winegrowers' adaptive
   processes in the context of climate change},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is a major challenge facing the viticulture
   sector. Temporally, adaptation strategies and policies have to address
   potential impacts in both the short- and long term, whereas spatially,
   place-based and context-specific adaptations are essential. To help
   inform decision-making on climate change adaptation, this study adopted
   a bottom-up approach to assess local climate vulnerability and
   winegrowers' adaptive processes in two regulated wine-producing areas in
   the Anjou-Saumur wine growing sub-region, France. The data used for this
   study were collected through individual semi-structured interviews with
   30 winegrowers. With a focus on wine quality, climate-related exposure,
   and sensitivity were dependent on many contextual factors (e.g.,
   northern geographical position, wine regulatory frameworks, local
   environmental features) interacting with the regional oceanic climate.
   Climate and other non-climate-related variables brought about important
   changes in winegrowers' management practices, varying in time and space.
   This ongoing process in decision-making enhanced winegrowers' adaptive
   responses, which were primarily reactive (e.g., harvesting, winemaking)
   or anticipatory (e.g., canopy and soil management) to short-term climate
   conditions. Winegrowers described changing trends in climate- and
   grapevine (Vitis) -related variables, with the latter attributed to
   regional climate changes and evolving management practices. Regarding
   future climate trends, winegrowers' displayed great uncertainty, placing
   the most urgent adaptation priority on short-term strategies, while
   changing grapevine varieties and using irrigation were identified as
   last resort strategies. The study concluded by discussing the
   implications of these findings in the context of climate change
   adaptation in viticulture.},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts are expected to increase pressure upon coastal
   defenses worldwide. However, most adaptation measures for coastal
   defenses (if any) are still triggered by today's local problems, rather
   than addressing the expected long-term climate change. This gives rise
   to the question whether long-term strategies might bring advantages over
   continuing present coastal management practice during the next 200
   years. Comparing long-term coastal management strategies is surrounded
   by both physical and sociological uncertainties, impeding this
   comparisons straightforwardness. A new assessment methodology has been
   set LIP, accounting for these uncertainties in impacts of optional
   long-term coastal management strategies. Applying this new assessment
   framework to a case study for the Dutch coast shows that assessments of
   long-term coastal management strategies differentiate sufficiently for
   comparison, despite all uncertainties involved.},

Abstract = {Constraints and limits to adaptation are critical to understanding the
   extent to which human and natural systems can successfully adapt to
   climate change. We conduct a systematic review of 1,682 academic studies
   on human adaptation responses to identify patterns in constraints and
   limits to adaptation for different regions, sectors, hazards, adaptation
   response types, and actors. Using definitions of constraints and limits
   provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we
   find that most literature identifies constraints to adaptation but that
   there is limited literature focused on limits to adaptation. Central and
   South America and Small Islands generally report greater constraints and
   both hard and soft limits to adaptation. Technological, infrastructural,
   and ecosystem-based adaptation suggest more evidence of constraints and
   hard limits than other types of responses. Individuals and households
   face economic and socio-cultural constraints which also inhibit
   behavioral adaptation responses and may lead to limits. Finance,
   governance, institutional, and policy constraints are most prevalent
   globally. These findings provide early signposts for boundaries of human
   adaptation and are of high relevance for guiding proactive adaptation
   financing and governance from local to global scales.},

Abstract = {Climate is a primary resource for beach-based tourism. It defines the
   length and quality of the tourist season and plays a major role in
   destination choices and revenues. The Mediterranean is coincidentally
   one of the most visited tourist destinations and sensitive areas to
   climate change worldwide. Social, economic and environmental adaptation
   to climate change in this region should necessarily evaluate the
   Mediterranean and European climate resource for beach-based tourism as
   well as its projected changes. To this end, the second-generation
   climate index for tourism (CIT) has been adopted. ERA-Interim reanalysis
   have been used as the regional observed baseline, thus providing daily
   atmospheric data to derive CIT. For projections, meteorological
   variables have been obtained from a set of regional climate models
   (RCMs) within the ENSEMBLES European project. A quantile-quantile
   adjustment has been applied to the CIT cumulative distribution functions
   based on each individual RCM output to properly correct biases at
   regional and local scales. Furthermore, an ensemble strategy is adopted
   to further cope with uncertainties arising from RCM errors and boundary
   conditions. The spatial distribution of present climate potential
   confirms the Mediterranean coast as the most suitable region in Europe
   for carrying out beach leisure activities. Excellent climatic conditions
   prevail in most of this coastal region during summer. However, the
   optimal climate asset is projected to noticeably deteriorate in summer
   across the Mediterranean, whereas only slightly improving in
   northwestern Europe by 2075-2094. On the other hand, a general
   enhancement of ideal climate potential is expected for the shoulder
   seasons in the former region. That is, optimal climatic conditions may
   shift from the present peak demand season to spring and autumn. These
   potential impacts might lead to important drawbacks for the current
   strongly seasonal-adjusted beach-based tourism industry in the
   Mediterranean. Therefore, main tourism stakeholders will likely need to
   face these challenges through adaptation and mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Modes of regeneration and adaptation to soft-bottom substrates of the
   free-living solitary scleractinian Deltocyathoides orientalis},

Abstract = {Scleractinian corals adapt to various substrate conditions with a
   variety of growth morphologies and modes of life. The azooxanthellate
   solitary scleractinian Deltocyathoides orientalis exhibits slightly
   flattened, bowl-shaped corallites. This study describes in detail the
   modes of skeletal regeneration after fragmentation in association with
   exquisitely adaptive strategies of the corals for life on soft
   substrates. Larger fragments of individuals retaining almost two-thirds
   to five-sixths of the original skeletal area inherit the densely
   dilated, lower central skeleton, so as to keep a stable life position on
   soft substrates and regenerate the lost parts promptly. Even highly
   fragmented individuals preserving less than 10\% of the original
   skeleton still regenerate and repair. Fragmented individuals with almost
   one-sixth to one-third original skeleton actively maintain a posture
   with the oral disc upward using movements of remaining tentacles.
   Damaged and missing soft tissues are then efficiently regenerated to
   form a mouth and gastrovascular cavity near the new centre of the
   corallum. Every regenerated individual reuses skeleton and soft tissues,
   and is capable of burrowing before the completion of growth morphology.
   The mode of regeneration characteristic of D.orientalis is thus
   effective and adaptive for maintenance of a stable life position on soft
   substrates for this solitary scleractinian. As fragmentation in
   deeper-water, soft-bottom settings is likely due to predation rather
   than turbulence, the rapid corallum regeneration and burrowing strategy
   may both represent adaptive strategies for life on soft substrates and
   exploitation of new niches, such as an infaunal mode of life, in a
   predator-rich environment.},

Abstract = {Time and again, climate change is a global phenomenon; intrinsically
   affects people and the environment more at the local and the global
   level when driven anthropogenically. Due to multiple reasons, the
   coastal region is more vulnerable to ongoing and forthcoming climate
   change. The study was conducted to develop a framework and to discuss
   the perception of fishery-based farmers and their response to the
   climate-induced crisis through their management practices. It is well
   known that preventing climate change is costly; alternatively, measures
   can be initiated to mitigate its adverse effects on humans as well as on
   the ecosystem. The importance of utilizing the internal physical,
   social, and psychological aspects of a farming community to deal with
   crisis management efficiently has been unearthed in this study. It is
   understood that climate-induced crisis management is contributed by
   psycho-socio-economic factors associated with the farmer and his
   environment. The computing effects of these exogenous variables may lead
   to the emergence of hybrid, moribund, socio-economic structures, which
   may increase the tendency of farmers for vulnerability to climate
   change. Analysis of these variables affecting crisis management will
   help to identify and undertake practical approaches to alter the
   favourable and manipulable variables connected with crisis management.
   The results are more relevant for farmers, extension professionals,
   governmental agencies, Non-Government Organizations, and scientists who
   play a definite role in the management of crisis-induced by climate
   change.},

Title = {Assessing and reducing vulnerability to climate change: Moving from
   theory to practical decision-support},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {220-229},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As climate change continues to impact socio-ecological systems, tools
   that assist conservation managers to understand vulnerability and target
   adaptations are essential. Quantitative assessments of vulnerability are
   rare because available frameworks are complex and lack guidance for
   dealing with data limitations and integrating across scales and
   disciplines. This paper describes a semi-quantitative method for
   assessing vulnerability to climate change that integrates
   socio-ecological factors to address management objectives and support
   decision making. The method applies a framework first adopted by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and uses a structured 10-step
   process. The scores for each framework element are normalized and
   multiplied to produce a vulnerability score and then the assessed
   components are ranked from high to low vulnerability. Sensitivity
   analyses determine which indicators most influence the analysis and the
   resultant decision-making process so data quality for these indicators
   can be reviewed to increase robustness. Prioritisation of components for
   conservation considers other economic, social and cultural values with
   vulnerability rankings to target actions that reduce vulnerability to
   climate change by decreasing exposure or sensitivity and/or increasing
   adaptive capacity. This framework provides practical decision-support
   and has been applied to marine ecosystems and fisheries, with two case
   applications provided as examples: (1) food security in Pacific Island
   nations under climate-driven fish declines, and (2) fisheries in the
   Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. The step-wise process outlined
   here is broadly applicable and can be undertaken with minimal resources
   using existing data, thereby having great potential to inform adaptive
   natural resource management in diverse locations.},

Title = {On the move: The role of mobility and migration as a coping strategy for
   resource users after abrupt environmental disturbance - the empirical
   example of the Coastal El Nino 2017},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Individual mobility - moving between and within different geographic
   regions - represents an adaptation strategy of natural resource users
   worldwide to cope with sudden and gradual changes in resource
   abundances. This work traces the recent history of Peruvian small-scale
   fishers' migration, and particularly analyses the spatial mobility
   patterns of resource users along the Peruvian coastline in the aftermath
   of the coastal El Nino 2017. In February-March 2017, this event caused
   extraordinary heavy rains and a rise in water temperatures along the
   coast of northern Peru, inducing negative consequences for the
   small-scale fisheries and scallop (Argopecten mupurams) aquaculture
   sectors, both representing important socio-economic activities in the
   region. Responses of local resource users to these changes were highly
   diverse, with a great number of people leaving the region in search for
   work in fishing and non-fishing activities. With a particular emphasis
   on the province of Sechura, this work attempts to shed light on how and
   why migration flows differ for fishers and scallop farmers and to
   explore future pathways in the context of post-disturbance recovery.
   About one year after the disturbance event, the small-scale fishery
   operated almost on a regular scale, while the aquaculture sector still
   struggled towards pre-El Nino conditions, reflected, for example, in a
   higher percentage of persons engaging in other economic activities
   within and outside the region. The results of this study demonstrate the
   importance of human movement and translocal social networks emerging in
   moments of crisis and should be considered for future development of
   long-term management strategies incorporating increasing
   interconnectedness of places on different scales in the face of future
   disturbance events. Understanding adaptation strategies of resource
   users in this particular social-ecological setting will further serve to
   inform other coastal systems prone to (re-occurring) environmental
   change by highlighting the diversity of socio-economic and natural
   drivers that can stipulate mobility and affect adaptive capacity of
   resource users.},

Abstract = {Climate change is widely recognised as a serious threat, especially to
   some Mediterranean wetlands; therefore, their ongoing protection is of
   great concern. Aiguamolls de l'Emporda (north-east Catalonia, Spain) and
   Kotychi-Strofylia wetland (western Greece) are considered important
   coastal wetlands deserving protection both by European and national
   authorities. The main aim of this study was to explore stakeholders'
   perceptions on local climate change there and to contrast these
   perceptions with some of the local meteorological data from the Estartit
   station (near Aiguamolls de l'Emporda) and Andravida station (near
   Kotychi-Strofylia). Semi-structured interviews with thirty-six
   stakeholders from both coastal wetlands have been conducted with the aim
   of understanding the perception and constraints facing those currently
   engaged in a wide range of social, political, environmental and economic
   activities in both territories. The research results showed that major
   climate change effects such as increased air temperature, precipitation
   change, prolonged droughts and shifting seasons were more pronounced
   over the past twenty years and are of particular concern in both
   wetlands and their surrounding areas. Moreover, the stakeholders from
   Spain had a higher awareness of sustainability issues than those from
   Greece. It is worth mentioning that about two-thirds of the interviewed
   stakeholders in both areas perceived their coastal wetlands as
   unsustainable. In addition, stakeholders from the Greek area had higher
   willingness for not emigrating from their territory than those from
   Spain. Finally, about half of the stakeholders indicated that they are
   in favour of natural adaptation measures based on technical solutions
   such as setting up sand dunes and beach barriers.},

Title = {Community-based adaptation to climate change: lessons from Tanna Island,
   Vanuatu},

Abstract = {Community-based adaptation has gained significant international
   attention as a way for communities to respond to the increasing threats
   and complex pressures posed by climate change. This bottom-up strategy
   represents an alternative to the prolonged reliance on, and widespread
   ineffectiveness of, mitigation methods to halt climate change, in
   addition to the exacerbation of vulnerability resulting from top-down
   adaptation approaches. Yet despite the promises of this alternative
   approach, the efficacy of community-based adaptation remains unknown.
   Its potential to reduce vulnerability within communities remains a
   significant gap in knowledge, largely due to limited participatory
   evaluations with those directly affected by these initiatives, to
   determine the success and failure of project design, implementation,
   outcomes and long-term impact. This paper seeks to close this gap by
   undertaking an in-depth evaluation of multiple community-based
   adaptation projects in Tanna Island, Vanuatu and exploring community
   attitudes and behavioural changes. This study found that future
   community-based adaptation should integrate contextual specificities and
   gender equality frameworks into community-based adaptation design and
   implementation, as well as recognise and complement characteristics of
   local resilience and innovation. In doing this, the critical importance
   of looking beyond assumptions of Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
   as homogenous, primarily vulnerable to climate change and lacking
   resilience, was also recognised.},

Title = {The practice of integrating adaptation and disaster risk reduction in
   the south-west Pacific},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {365-375},
Abstract = {Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and emergency management (EM) efforts are
   integral to climate change adaptation (CCA). The integration of DRR with
   adaptation is globally recognized as a rational use of resources
   benefiting both areas. There is a substantial literature on the topic,
   but little on the practice of implementing such integration on the
   ground. This paper presents some of these experiences at national and
   agency levels in the south-west Pacific and outlines possible future
   directions to support policy and practice. Based on the perspectives of
   practitioners from Australia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, it
   explores institutional changes with country examples, and the range of
   constraints and enabling factors in integrating adaptation with DRR and
   EM practices. The Australian aim of spreading responsibility for CCA and
   DRR integration through mainstreaming across departments and agencies
   was seen as effective in increasing whole-of-government approaches.
   However, in both Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands the concentration of
   information, responsibility and actions through a single focal point was
   more effective in reducing overlap and providing a clearer picture of
   what was being implemented, by whom and where. The findings demonstrate
   a need to consider the experiences arising from practical implementation
   of the integration agenda and to document the lessons from this
   experience in a way that can inform policy and practice.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Predicted changes in climate will lead to seawater intrusion in the
   Queren double dagger a-Silves (QS) coastal aquifer (south Portugal)
   during the coming century if the current water-resource-management
   strategy is maintained. As for much of the Mediterranean, average
   rainfall is predicted to decrease along with increasing seasonal and
   inter-annual variability and there is a need to understand how these
   changes will affect the sustainable use of groundwater resources. A
   density-coupled flow and transport model of the QS was used to simulate
   an ensemble of climate, water-use and adaptation scenarios from 2010 to
   2099 taking into account intra- and inter-annual variability in recharge
   and groundwater use. By considering several climate models, bias
   correction and recharge calculation methods, a degree of uncertainty was
   included. Changes in rainfall regimes will have an immediate effect on
   groundwater discharge; however, the effect on saltwater intrusion is
   attenuated by the freshwater-saltwater interfaces' comparatively slow
   rate of movement. Comparing the effects of adaptation measures
   demonstrates that the extent of intrusion in the QS is controlled by the
   long-term water budget, as the effectiveness of both demand and supply
   oriented measures is proportional to the change in water budget, and
   that to maintain the current position, average groundwater discharge
   should be in the order of 50 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1).},

Title = {The Mediterranean Rhodes Gyre: modelled impacts of climate change,
   acidification and fishing},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {690},
Pages = {31-50},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean Rhodes Gyre is a cyclonic gyre with high primary
   production due to local upwelling of nutrients and occasional deep
   overturning up to 1 km depth. This nutrientrich state is in sharp
   contrast to other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean which are
   oligotrophic. Here we investigated the upwelling system central to the
   Rhodes Gyre and the impact of different stressors like meteorological
   changes, acidification and fishing pressure up to the year 2100. A water
   column model spanning the physical, chemical and biological system up to
   top predators (GOTM-ERSEM-BFM-EwE) was used to simulate the pelagic
   environment under single and combined stressors. Results show that due
   to increasing winter temperatures, deep overturning events will become
   more rare in the future until they stop occurring around 2060 under the
   Paris-agreement climate scenario (RCP4.5) or around 2040 under the
   business-as-usual climate scenario (RCP8.5). Stratification will become
   stronger as temperature effects outweigh salinity effects in the surface
   mixed layer. Together with the lack of deep overturning, this stronger
   stratification limits the nutrient supply to the euphotic zone,
   significantly reducing primary production. Phytoplankton species shift
   towards smaller species as nutrients become more scarce, mimicking the
   situation found currently on the edge of the gyre. Climatic changes and
   fishing pressure will affect higher trophic levels in an additive way
   for some species (sardines, dolphins), while in a synergistic way for
   others (anchovy, mackerel). Acidification impacts are negligible. Fish
   stocks will reduce significantly under all scenarios involving climate
   change effects: similar to 30\% under scenarios imposing RCP4.5 and
   similar to 40\% under scenarios imposing RCP8.5. The beneficial impact
   of maximum sustained yield-level fishing is very limited, indicating a
   need for mitigating measures beyond fleet control.},

Title = {Vulnerability drivers for small pelagics and milkfish aquaculture value
   chain determined through online participatory approach},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts on the fisheries can be short-term or long-term,
   making them highly vulnerable. Fishers' vulnerability encompasses
   several factors and includes, among others, their sensitivity, exposure
   to the elements, and their adaptive capacity. The main aim of this study
   was to help develop a vulnerability assessment tool that can be applied
   in the various nodes of the fisheries and aquaculture value chains with
   a long-term view of enhancing the resilience of the fisheries and
   helping increase the adaptive capacity of the fishing communities. A
   participatory technique using online workshops was conducted together
   with various stakeholders (N = 214) who gave insights and suggested
   indicators that drive climate change impacts and vulnerability. Based on
   the online workshops conducted, the common hazards/drivers were
   increasing temperature, typhoons, flooding (sealevel rise), and the
   recent pandemic, which consequently destroy coral reef ecosystems,
   affect fisheries yield, increases fish mortality, damage boats, fishing
   gears, pens, cages, pond dikes, erode beach properties, and devastate
   houses. In association with these impacts, mobility, travel, processing,
   and logistic operations are severely reduced. In the human dimension,
   the fishers and fish farmers are directly affected in terms of income
   loss, destroyed fishing gears, nutritional deficiencies and health
   impacts, less fishing operations, early or reduced harvest yield, and
   low market value of products. In the adaptation options, the
   infrastructure, social, economic, awareness/knowledge, and relevant
   governance/policy dimensions are needed to address and help mitigate
   various climate change impacts.},

Title = {A Prospective Study for the Mitigation of the Climate Change Effects:
   The Case of the North Aegean Region of Greece},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {One of the biggest challenges of our time is climate change. Every day,
   at different places of the world, the planet sends alarming messages
   about the enormous transformations it is experiencing due to human-based
   activities. The latter are responsible for changing weather patterns
   that threaten food production, energy production and energy consumption,
   the desertification of land, the displacement of people and animals
   because of food and water shortages due to the reductions in rainfall,
   natural disasters and rising sea levels. The effects of climate change
   affect us all, and if drastic measures are not considered in a timely
   manner, it will be more difficult and costly to adapt to the
   aforementioned effects in the future. Considering this context, the aim
   of this work is to implement a prospective study/structural analysis to
   the identified sectors of a regional plan of adaptation to climate
   change so as to promote the resilience of the region against the
   negative phenomena generated by the climate crisis. This was achieved in
   two steps: first, we identified the relationships between the strategic
   sectors of the plan and organized them in order of importance. Second,
   we assessed the effectiveness of several public policies oriented
   towards a city's resilience according to their impact upon the strategic
   sectors of the plan and the co-benefits generated by their
   implementation for society. The results highlight that the most
   essential sectors for the mitigation of climate change are flood risk
   management, built environment, forest ecosystem management, human
   health, tourism and rise in sea level. As a consequence, the most
   important measures for the resilience of the North Aegean Region against
   climate change are the ones related to the preparation of strategic
   master plans for flood protection projects.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces and summarizes a series of articles on the
   potential impacts of sea level rise on Florida's natural and human
   communities and what might be done to reduce the severity of those
   impacts. Most of the papers in this special issue of Climatic Change
   were developed from presentations at a symposium held at Archbold
   Biological Station in January 2010, sponsored by the Florida Institute
   for Conservation Science. Symposium participants agreed that adaptation
   to sea level rise for the benefit of human communities should be planned
   in concert with adaptation to reduce vulnerability and impacts to
   natural communities and native species. The papers in this special issue
   discuss both of these categories of impacts and adaptation options. In
   this introductory paper, I place the subject in context by noting that
   that the literature in conservation biology related to climate change
   has been concerned largely about increasing temperatures and reduced
   moisture availability, rather than about sea level rise. The latter,
   however, is the most immediate and among the most severe impacts of
   global warming in low-lying regions such as Florida. I then review the
   content of this special issue by summarizing and interpreting the
   following 10 papers. I conclude with a review of the recommendations for
   research and policy that were developed from group discussions at the
   Archbold symposium. The main lesson that emerges from this volume is
   that sea level rise, combined with human population growth, urban
   development in coastal areas, and landscape fragmentation, poses an
   enormous threat to human and natural well-being in Florida. How
   Floridians respond to sea level rise will offer lessons, for better or
   worse, for other low-lying regions worldwide.},

Title = {Assessment of the impact of climate change on coastal aquifers in Oman},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper evaluates numerically the effects of climate change
   (precipitation, temperature, and sea level rise (SLR)) on two selected
   coastal aquifers located in the north of Oman: (1) Jamma aquifer which
   is mainly used for irrigation and (2) Samail Lower Catchment aquifer
   (SLC) which is a strategic reserve for domestic water supply, hence it
   is of great economic value. Unlike Jamma aquifer, SLC maintains positive
   gradient seaward as the aquifer is currently well-managed. The water
   dynamics in both aquifers are studied numerically using MODFLOW and
   MT3DMS codes under the different Representative Concentration Pathway
   scenarios (RCPs) for years 2050 and 2070 according to the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Results show that the
   salinized area in Jamma site, considering the intruded distance of the
   selected 1500ppm iso-concentric line, will increase by 32 and 38\% by
   years 2050 and 2070, respectively, compared to the situation for the
   base case year 2015. This effect is significant given the narrow
   agricultural strip area it covers which is also shared for urban and
   industrial land uses. Hence, the farming community will be severely
   affected. The positive hydraulic gradient seaward direction for SLC
   aquifer (because of proper management) helps to combat significant
   intrusion of saltwater. In general, the results show rapid climate
   change impacts during the next 15years which urges implementation of
   measures to reduce the effect, before the farming community at large
   (along with other users) be severely affected and adaptation measures
   become infeasible. SLR was found to be the main climatic factor that
   will significantly affect the stressed coastal aquifers. The change in
   rainfall rate for north of Oman is small and the effect of
   evapotranspiration is relatively low given the high extinction depth
   (deep water table) and sparse vegetation. The extent of the effect of
   climate change on aquifers is site specific. Stressed aquifers like
   Jamma are highly vulnerable and severely affected. Alleviation of the
   impact and adaptation measures must be planned first for more vulnerable
   aquifers. The adaptation measures should include managed aquifer
   recharge using both ephemeral floods generated by irregular and limited
   rainfall events and by using treated wastewater, expanding in reuse of
   treated wastewater, and improving the efficiency of irrigation (main
   consumer of available water, >80\%) along with better water pricing
   policies. Although the currently well-managed aquifer systems (e.g.,
   SLC) are not significantly affected by climate change, improper
   development and management of those systems would definitely shift them
   to be more vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change. The findings
   of this study are importance for the water resources managers as they
   stressed that precaution measures must be implemented for the
   deterioratedaquifer (like Jamma aquifer) while protecting and
   maintaining the well-managed groundwater systems (e.g., SLC aquifer) as
   these show more resilience to climate change. Efforts should be devoted
   to manage stressed aquifer systems as a priority in order to improve
   their resilience level to climate change.},

Title = {Mapping the city scale anthropogenic heat emissions from buildings in
   Kuala Lumpur through a top-down and a bottom-up approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The warming urban climates increase the building energy consumption by
   changing the heating/cooling loads of the buildings. On the other hand,
   building induced anthropogenic heat emissions can also contribute to the
   urban heating, creating a warming feedback loop. Such impact is more
   profound in the (sub)tropical and hot/arid context, where Air
   Conditioning (AC) systems are widely used. A better understanding of the
   building energy consumption and its contribution to urban heating can
   therefore help mitigate urban heating. To this end, we aim to estimate
   building energy use and induced heat emissions in Kuala Lumpur,
   Malaysia, using both a bottom-up strategy based on building energy
   modelling and a top-down strategy based on national scale energy
   inventory. We further integrate the building energy model with measured
   diurnal temperature profiles at different land use areas, to discuss the
   impact of urban heat island (UHI) on energy use, and potential
   mitigation strategies through different urban morphologies. The
   estimated energy use obtained via both bottom-up and the top-down
   approaches were within the range of actual energy use from case studies
   available for Kuala Lumpur. It also highlights the need to adapt
   multi-scale strategies to mitigate the building energy use, and the
   associated impacts on the UHI.},

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background: With conventional coral reef conservation methods proving
   ineffective against intensifying climate change, efforts have focussed
   on augmenting coral tolerance to warmer water-the primary driver of
   coral declines. We document coral cover and composition in relation to
   sea surface temperature (SST) over 25-years, of six marginal reefs in an
   upwelling area of Costa Rica's Eastern Tropical Pacific.Methods: Using
   reef survey data and sea surface temperature (SST) dating back over
   25-years, we document coral cover and composition of six marginal reefs
   in an upwelling area of Costa Rica's Eastern Tropical Pacific in
   relation to thermal highs and lows.Results.: A ubiquitous and
   catastrophic coral die-off event occurred in 2009, driven by SST minima
   and likely by the presence of extreme harmful algal blooms. Coral cover
   was dramatically reduced and coral composition shifted from dominant
   branching Pocillopora to massive Pavona, Porites, and Gardineroseris.
   The lack of coral recovery in the decade since indicates a breach in
   ecosystem tipping-point and highlights a need for resilience-based
   management (RBM) and restoration. We propose a locally tailored and
   globally scalable approach to coral reef declines that is founded in RBM
   and informed by coral health dynamics.},

Title = {Exploring Flood Resilience Thinking in the Retail Sector under Climate
   Change: A Case Study of an Estuarine Region of Taipei City},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With predictions of extreme precipitation and sea-level rise under
   climate change that may induce morphological changes of estuaries,
   increased estuarine flood risk needs to be considered. The aim of this
   case study was to contemplate sustainability from the perspective of
   flood resilience that focuses on environmental problems and solutions.
   The study provided insights into retailers' resilience thinking
   regarding the flood-prone Shetzu Peninsula in Taipei City. It is of
   concern that the retailers strategically identified potential flood
   risks and have developed adaptive knowledge, skills, and networks. The
   Location Quotient (LQ) analysis was conducted to verify that the retail
   sector of Shetzu Peninsula was considered a basic industry. Further
   assessments, an interactive visualization model and a consumption
   intensity map, were provided as supportive data. Based on the results,
   semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore 15 key retailers'
   resilience thinking on how to adapt to floods in terms of risk
   communication under climate change. This approach is vital to meet the
   adaptation challenge in the Shetzu Peninsula. As a result, the study
   indicated that retailers have strategically identified potential
   weather-related risks and have implemented adaptation plans for each
   store functions. The study discussed that, in the face of climate
   change, maladaptation, interactive visualization models for
   communicating flood risks, and place attachment are key issues to
   increase flood resilience under climate change. The introduction of
   adaptation interventions in terms of urban resilience as a part of a
   comprehensive strategy helps to manage the impacts of climate change
   towards urban sustainability.},

Abstract = {Warming from climate change and resulting increases in energy stored in
   the oceans is causing changes in the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry
   of marine systems, exacerbating current challenges facing marine
   fisheries. Although studies have evaluated effects of rising
   temperatures on marine species, few have looked at these impacts along
   with other environmental drivers over long time periods. In this study,
   we associate long-term density of blacklip abalone to changing
   oceanographic conditions in a climate change `hot-spot' off southeast
   Australia. We downscaled and hind-casted existing hydrodynamic models to
   provide information on waves and currents over 25 yr and used this
   information to run biophysical connectivity models. We combined the
   connectivity models with 21 yr of data on abalone density, temperature,
   seafloor habitat, and the effects of a disease outbreak in an machine
   learning modeling approach to develop a spatio-temporal model of abalone
   density. We found that the combination of temperature, connectivity,
   current speed, wave orbital velocity, fishery catch, depth, reef
   structure and a disease outbreak explain 70\% of variation in abalone
   density and allowed us to create 30 m resolution predictive grids with
   75\% accuracy. An emerging hotspot analysis run on the individual
   predictive grids from each year detected a predominance of low-density
   grids across the region, with 49.5\% of cells classified as cold spots,
   14.3\% as hotspots and 36.2\% with no significant patterns observed.
   This type of spatio-temporal analysis provides important insights into
   how changing environmental conditions are impacting density in an
   important fishery species, allowing for better adaptive management in
   the face of future climate change.},

Abstract = {The Province of Khanh Hoa, Vietnam, is located in the western South
   China Sea and boasts a shoreline of 385 km and many islands. Previous
   studies have indicated the extreme diversity and abundance of coral
   reefs in its waters as compared with other coastal provinces of Vietnam.
   A study on the resilience of coral reefs against increased surface water
   temperature and anthropogenic impact is conducted at 19 reef sites in
   2015. At each site, a series of parameters (e.g., coral covers, genus
   diversity, and coral recruitment, substratum heterogeneity, depth, water
   exchange level, and sediment deposit and water temperature) are measured
   quantitatively or semi-quantitatively. The measured data are rated based
   on the relationship between the parameter values and coral
   susceptibility; the consideration that reef health reflects the
   biological capability to adapt to environmental changes and the
   recruitment potential if bleached; and positive or negative influences
   of physical factors in the mitigation of thermal stress and protecting
   corals from bleaching. A cumulative analysis enables researchers to
   divide the studied reefs into four categories based on varying levels of
   reef health to support resilience, recovery, and vulnerability in the
   case of increased water temperature. Relevant management interventions
   for each category and other supporting activities are suggested to
   enhance management effectiveness and to plan the rehabilitation of coral
   reefs for biodiversity conservation and touristic development, taking
   into account the involvement of related stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) and global warming effects increase the urban
   ambient temperature. During recent years, heat mitigation strategies
   have been implemented through experiments and simulations due to the
   significant impacts of these phenomena, especially on near-surface air
   temperature. UHI mitigation may help cities adapt to the future effects
   of increasing local air temperature, which are crucial especially in
   tropical cities. The impact of increasing roof albedo as a UHI
   mitigation strategy coupled to roof renovation with different
   performance levels was evaluated in the center of Palermo (Italy) as a
   case study. To this aim, ENVI-met (version 4.4.5) was used. In addition,
   three different thermal transmittance scenarios and four albedo
   scenarios (from 0.1 to 0.9) related to roofs were compared to simulate
   the efficiency of the roofs at the peak hour on the hottest day of a
   typical summer heatwave in terms of reduction in air temperature. Based
   on the results, changing the albedo of the roofs in the selected area
   led to a decrease in air temperature. The most obvious temperature drops
   of 0.37 degrees C were recorded in the scenario where the non-insulated
   roof was applied, while it was around 0.20 degrees C in other scenarios.
   Finally, changing roof albedo can have a limited impact on UHI if
   coupled with high roof thermal resistance.},

Year = {2016},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the adaptive capacity of coastal urban and
   peri-urban Indigenous People's to climate change. It is based on the
   findings of a National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility
   (NCCARF) funded project that utilised a series of case studies that
   engaged key representatives from Indigenous organisations in five
   coastal locations in three states of south-eastern Australia (Low Choy
   D, Clarke P, Jones D, Serrao-Neumann S, Hales R, Koschade O et al.,
   Aboriginal reconnections: understanding coastal urban and peri-urban
   Indigenous people's vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climate
   change, National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold
   Coast, 139 pp, 2013). The study has highlighted the social, economic and
   environmental impacts on urban and peri-urban Indigenous communities
   inhabiting coastal areas throughout south-eastern Australia. These
   impacts include a loss of community and environmental assets, such as
   cultural heritage sites, with significant impacts on their quality of
   life and the establishment of potential favourable conditions for the
   spread of plant diseases, weeds and pests. The study also found that
   opportunities did not readily exist for engagement with climate change
   adaptation policy and initiatives and this was further exacerbated by
   acute shortages of qualified/experienced Indigenous members that could
   represent their communities' interests in climate change adaptation
   forums. The evidence emerging from this research clearly demonstrates
   that Aboriginal people's consideration of the future, even with the
   overlay of climate change and the requirements for serious
   considerations of adaptation, are significantly influenced and dominated
   by economic aspirations which are seen as fundamental survival
   strategies for their communities.
   A number of specific climate change induced issues to emerge from the
   research included: the potential for Indigenous involvement in the `bush
   tucker' industry utilising wild plant species will potentially suffer
   from changes in species availability; concern was expressed about
   changes associated with peri-urban and urban development which appears
   to be escalating micro-environmental changes; peri-urbanisation is a
   major environmental change which threatens cultural assets including
   Aboriginal sites; Indigenous communities need representation in climate
   change adaptation forums and to be more directly involved in land and
   sea care projects. The chapter concludes with recommendations to better
   position Aboriginal engagement and knowledge systems in the wider
   climate change adaptation policy discourse.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) is one of the greatest
   challenges of the low-lying coastal regions of the world. Adaptation to
   the rising sea level is considered the most appropriate response measure
   to face this global challenge. However, this requires a pragmatic
   approach that's locally suitable. The first step would be projecting SLR
   locally under different scenarios and at different time slices. SLR
   projections for specific coastal regions, particularly for developing
   countries are seldom available and this study puts forth a research
   question as to what will be the SLR projections under different
   scenarios for the chosen study area, i.e. the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
   coast of India. SimCLIM climate modeling software has been used to
   project SLR for the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coast in India for four
   periods of time slice namely 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2100 for all four RCP
   scenarios viz., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 of IPCC AR5. It
   has been estimated that the projected average medium range of SLR for
   the chosen study area may range from 7.12 cm to 36.98 cm for RCP 2.6;
   7.39 cm to 50.01 cm for RCP 4.5; 7.18 cm to 51.91 cm for RCP 6.0; 7.40
   cm to 78.15 cm for RCP 8.5 for the time slices from 2025 to 2100. It is
   expected that the numbers gleaned from this study will be of a potential
   source of information for coastal policy-planners and decision-makers to
   take the first step towards planning time bound SLR adaptation policies
   to conserve coastal resources particularly for the coast of Tamil Nadu
   and Puducherry.},

Abstract = {This study provides the comprehensive analysis of changes in mean and
   extreme temperature indices of India to assist the climate change
   mitigation and adaptation strategies and to add information for the
   global comparisons, using a high-resolution daily gridded temperature
   data set (1 degrees x1 degrees) during 1971-2005. In addition to the
   indices recommended by the World Meteorological Organization/CLIVAR
   Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices, few more indices
   having social and agricultural implication are investigated at the
   seasonal and annual scales, utilizing widely adopted statistical
   methodologies in climate research. The results show, in general, a
   robust signal of warming, broadly consistent with what has been observed
   and predicted in other parts of the world in the context of global
   warming. The frequency and intensity of warm extremes, especially
   representing the daily minimum temperature, have increased with
   simultaneous decreases in cold extremes in large parts of the country,
   but the spatial distribution of the trend magnitude reflects the complex
   natural climatic settings of India and its possible interaction with the
   anthropogenic forcing. Seasonal analysis reveals a faster warming in day
   and night temperatures in winter affecting the major wheat crop. In
   summer, however, both human and ecosystems appear to be more vulnerable
   to the increasing tendency of the heatwave occurrences, particularly
   during night-time, since the 1990s. The relationship with the
   large-scale natural climatic modes indicates that the warming indices
   tend to increase in the year following the El Nino events as evident
   from the correlation with the NINO3.4 index, with a relatively higher
   association in the monsoon season. Moreover, the concurrent
   correspondence of the summer heatwaves with the north Indian Ocean sea
   surface temperature suggests a degree of predictability of the heat
   stress episode.},

   evidence, to investigate the social and economic roles of French animal
   husbandry as an adaptive strategy for the settlers taking part in La
   Salle's famous expedition (1684-1688) to colonize the mouth of the
   Mississippi River. Stable carbon- and nitrogen-isotope analyses of pig
   bones and other faunal remains from the shipwreck, La Belle, and
   associated Fort Saint Louis on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico
   are used to evaluate specific historical accounts of colonists'
   animal-husbandry practices and show that a large swine population was
   sustained primarily on meat from local hunting activities. In this
   context it is argued that, although the substantial efforts involved in
   raising pigs mainly on other animal products seemingly makes little
   economic sense, there are social explanations for what initially appears
   to be irrational behavior. This study provides an example of how
   stable-isotope analyses of animal-husbandry practices can contribute to
   understanding social processes through historical archaeology.},

Title = {Water Use Efficiency-Based Multiscale Assessment of Ecohydrological
   Resilience to Ecosystem Shifts Over the Continent of Africa During
   1992-2015},

Abstract = {The spatial-temporal representation is a crucial key for understanding
   at what extent terrestrial ecosystems can maintain their structure and
   functions and recover from various ecosystem shifts (drought/wet).
   Hence, it is vital for sustainable ecosystem management, adaptation, and
   mitigation practices. This study assessed ecohydrological resilience to
   ecosystem shifts at contrast water-limited and well-watered regions at
   multiple scales (i.e., country scale, basin scale, climate type scale,
   and land cover scale) over Africa during the period 1992-2015, based on
   Standard Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) and water use
   efficiency (WUE) at ecosystem scales, which was obtained from
   satellite-derived evapotranspiration (ET) and simulated gross primary
   productivity (GPP) using the Carnegie-ames-stanford approaches (CASA)
   model. SEDI values indicated that 11 years were characterized by dry
   conditions, while 13 were wetter years during 1992-2015. WUE, ET, and
   GPP values indicated increased tendencies mostly in central to central
   west of African continent. The ecohydrological resilience exhibited that
   about 68.78\% of African terrestrial ecosystems were highly, moderately,
   or slightly resilient, and about 31.22\% were not resilient to ecosystem
   shifts with 11.28\% vulnerably exposed to high risk of ecosystem shift
   and severely nonresilient. The extent areas exposed to severe
   ecohydrological nonresilience are distributed in Savannas and barelands
   land cover types, temperate-dry summer-hot summer (Csa), climate type,
   Mediterranean South Coast (B14), African-North interior (B3), and Red
   Sea-Golf of Aden Coast (b5) basins; and the four countries, namely,
   Egypt, Mauritania, Niger, and Tunisia. These findings may provide
   insightful scientific information about vulnerable regions for policy
   making and ecosystem management and increase the necessary awareness for
   taking reasonable adaptation mechanisms, such as afforesting open lands
   to increase the area of vegetation cover (i.e., choosing the drought or
   wet-tolerant plant species) and water conservation and management
   measures to ensure the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems under
   ecosystem shifts over the African continent.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change in the coastal regions of Bangladesh:
   proposal for the formation of community-based adaptation committees},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-49},
Abstract = {The paper outlines a concept and proposal for the formation of community
   based adaptation committees' (CBACs) at the micro-level, and it explains
   how such local committees would act with respect to the existing
   organisation of disaster management in Bangladesh. It examines how the
   CBACs would be sustained locally without colliding with the present
   system of government. The main objective of this is to identify how the
   CBACs could act independently as per local demands, without any conflict
   with the existing system, in order to ensure sustainable adaptation in
   future. To achieve these objectives the author conducted interviews with
   key informants at both local and national levels, and also conducted
   eight participatory rapid appraisal sessions at eight coastal
   communities. The author finds that severe corruption is impeding the
   existing system of relief and rehabilitation at community levels. The
   paper emphasises that the government of Bangladesh urgently needs to
   formulate a national adaptation policy, and that within that policy the
   concept of CBACs at community level should be prioritised. This would
   provide the government with guidelines for the use, at community level,
   of adaptation funds from developed countries in order to reduce future
   vulnerability in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Tourism entrepreneurship has not received sufficient attention in the
   context of protected areas (PAs). It needs careful management to avoid
   conflicts with conservation objectives and positively contribute to
   regional development. Traditional management approaches based on the
   strict application of the carrying capacity principle are suboptimal. An
   adaptive management framework has been demanded, but it has been
   scarcely adopted in practice or explored in previous research. Moreover,
   appropriate decision-making tools are lacking. This study proposes a
   combination of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and real options analysis
   (ROA) to support the sustainable tourism entrepreneurship development in
   PAs under an adaptive management framework. Costs are related to the
   conservation and restoration activities, and benefits to the use and
   non-use value placed by visitors on it, measured through visitors'
   willingness to pay (WTP) for sustainable tourism. The proposed model
   also embraces uncertainty and flexibility, considering visitors' WTP and
   tourism demand as the primary sources of uncertainty. Through the
   analysis of the sustainable tourism management of Ons Island, part of
   the Marine-Terrestrial National Park of the Atlantic Islands of Galicia,
   we exemplify the power of a combined CBA-ROA approach and derive
   implications for policymakers, PA managers, tourism entrepreneurs, and
   researchers.},

Title = {Understanding climate-change adaptation on Kakadu National Park, using a
   combined diagnostic and modelling framework: a case study at Yellow
   Water wetland},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1146-1158},
Abstract = {This paper describes a semi-quantitative approach for the assessment of
   sea-level rise (SLR) impacts on social-ecological systems (SES), using
   Yellow Water wetland on Kakadu National Park as a case study. The
   approach includes the application of a diagnostic framework to portray
   the existing SES configuration, including governance structures, in
   combination with qualitative modelling and Bayesian belief networks.
   Although SLR is predicted to cause saltwater inundation of freshwater
   ecosystems, cultural sites and built infrastructure, our study suggested
   that it may provide also an opportunity to bring together Indigenous and
   non-Indigenous knowledge and governance systems, towards a commonly
   perceived threat. Where feasible, mitigation actions such as levees may
   be required to manage local SLR impacts to protect important freshwater
   values. In contrast, adaptation will require strategies that facilitate
   participation by Kakadu Bininj (the Aboriginal people of Kakadu National
   Park) in research and monitoring programs that enhance understanding of
   salinity impacts and the adaptive capacity to respond to reasonably
   rapid, profound and irreversible future landscape-scale changes.},

Title = {Resilience: What is it and what does it mean for marine policymakers?},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Marine policymakers are facing increasing calls to consider the
   resilience of communities that rely on coastal and marine ecosystem
   goods and services, and the resilience of natural systems themselves.
   These calls are in response to increasing threats to coastal communities
   from external factors such as coastal hazards, possibly associated with
   climate change, reductions in natural capital often caused by
   over-fishing and invasive species, and drivers that act to change local
   and regional economic conditions leading to changes in employment and
   inequality. However, most communities have had little experience in
   explicitly managing for resilience. Similarly, our understanding of the
   factors that make a natural or social system resilient is also somewhat
   limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus-based definitions and
   performance measures for assessing resilience. These factors, along with
   other barriers, will need to be overcome before effective
   resilience-based management can be implemented. Crown Copyright (C) 2008

Title = {Using the COVID-19 economic crisis to frame climate change as a
   secondary issue reduces mitigation support},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has understandably dominated public discourse,
   crowding out other important issues such as climate change. Currently,
   if climate change enters the arena of public debate, it primarily does
   so in direct relation to the pandemic. In two experiments, we
   investigated (1) whether portraying the response to the COVID-19 threat
   as a ``trial run{''} for future climate action would increase
   climate-change concern and mitigation support, and (2) whether
   portraying climate change as a concern that needs to take a ``back
   seat{''} while focus lies on economic recovery would decrease
   climate-change concern and mitigation support. We found no support for
   the effectiveness of a trial-run frame in either experiment. In
   Experiment 1, we found that a back-seat frame reduced participants'
   support for mitigative action. In Experiment 2, the back-seat framing
   reduced both climatechange concern and mitigation support; a combined
   inoculation and refutation was able to offset the drop in climate
   concern but not the reduction in mitigation support.},

Title = {Water and Climate Governance in Deltas: On the Relevance of
   Anticipatory, Interactive, and Transformative Modes of Governance},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Deltas worldwide have been experiencing pressures and challenges
   exacerbated by climate change. An explicit focus on deltas is lacking in
   various bodies of literature, although present in those bodies focusing
   on the resilience of social-ecological systems. However, overall,
   literature relevant for addressing water and climate governance in
   deltas is arguably still fragmented, leading to knowledge gaps and
   unexplored opportunities with regards to the development of
   delta-oriented governance strategies. To address this knowledge gap, we
   conducted a systematic literature review focusing on six bodies of
   literature relevant to delta governance up to and including the year
   2019. The results show that scholarly interest in developing
   transformative pathways has increased sharply over the last few years.
   We derived seven key governance problems and five governance solutions
   for resilient deltas. We found that the predominant focus is still on
   technocratic approaches, with limited recognition of the political
   dimension and few forward-looking studies. In conclusion, we suggest
   stimulating the development and application of more anticipatory,
   transformative, and interactive modes of governance to help steer the
   transformation to resilient and sustainable deltas. We end with
   suggestions for systematic, interdisciplinary, and forward-looking
   empirical-analytical research.},

Title = {Simulated waterborne transmission of infectious hematopoietic necrosis
   virus among farmed salmon populations in British Columbia, Canada
   following a hypothetical virus incursion},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {548},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus is a rhabdovirus of
   significant concern to the salmon aquaculture industry in British
   Columbia (BC). IHN epidemic events in BC have historically resulted in
   high mortalities and economic losses among farmed salmon populations. A
   viral disease management plan (VDMP) was developed by salmon companies
   in BC in, 2010 and implemented during the 2012 IHN outbreak in BC with a
   positive outcome; however, to date the effectiveness of VDMP practices
   in managing IHN epidemics on a coast-wide scale has not been formally
   evaluated. Therefore, we developed a model to simulate the waterborne
   incursion and spread of IHN virus into salmon farms across the BC coast.
   The model was developed using the DTU-DADS-Aqua modelling framework and
   model processes were designed to reflect the epidemiology of IHN, along
   with farm management and disease mitigation protocols currently
   implemented in BC. The model was used to assess effectiveness of the
   VDMP compared with alternative mitigation approaches. Model results
   quantified the combined and individual effects of disease surveillance,
   detection efforts, depopulation measures, and vaccine efficacy in
   reducing IHN virus transmission. Model outputs indicated the need for
   use of multiple mitigation measures in combination for a highly
   effective reduction in spread. Furthermore, the use of an IHN vaccine
   with high population coverage and efficacy, and the implementation of
   surveillance zones and pre-emptive depopulation of all net-pens in
   IHNinfected farms are crucial to contain IHN epidemics. A comparison
   between simulated model scenarios showed that current VDMP practices
   were effective in both limiting the spread and mitigating IHN epidemics
   across the BC coast. The model can be used to inform policy decisions in
   aquaculture and siting of marine farms, and provides insights to limit
   the magnitude of IHN epidemics in farmed salmon populations.},

Title = {Recent Progress and Challenges in Microscale Urban Heat Modeling and
   Measurement for Urban Engineering Applications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This review focuses on progress and emerging challenges in
   experimentally validated modeling of microscale urban thermal
   environments over the last two decades. In the last few decades, there
   has been a surge in urban energy contribution resulting in elevated
   urban day-/night-time air temperatures. While there is no single
   solution to urban heat, mitigation strategies can be implemented to
   minimize the harmful effects of urban heat both on humans and the
   environment. To study the effects of urban heat, numerical modeling of
   urban thermal environments has seen a rise in usage of several
   application specific atmospheric modeling software packages, and
   multiple studies and reviews have already covered the prolific
   engineering use cases. However, there are inherent and unintentional
   biases introduced by each modeling software package, that inhibit
   validity and accuracy for general engineering use. This review
   critically analyzes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOA)
   microscale atmospheric modeling approaches and identify necessary areas
   for improvement. Urban thermal environment models must be validated with
   measurements to gain confidence in the predictive capabilities. This
   review will additionally examine the next generation of measurement
   techniques that leverage advances in computing and communications to
   create distributed meteorological sensor networks for improved spatial
   and temporal resolutions, that can provide a rich platform for model
   validation. High fidelity and accurate simulations of urban thermal
   environments improve confidence in the study of urban heat, its
   mitigation, and its impact on urban engineering applications in building
   energy usage and sustainability.},

Title = {Water nebulization to counteract urban overheating: Development and
   experimental test of a smart logic to maximize energy efficiency and
   outdoor environmental quality},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {239},
Pages = {1091-1113},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Several mature urban climate mitigation technologies have been proposed
   to date. What mostly hinders their wide implementation is that their
   efficiency heavily depends on the local microclimatic specificities,
   since they cannot self-adjust to the environmental changes. This study
   aims at investigating benefits and impacts of smart logics applied to
   outdoor cooling, by field testing a web of nebulizers coupled to a
   bespoke fuzzy controller piloting the pump. The cooling action was
   tweaked as convenient to maintain comfortable conditions and to avoid
   energy wastage whenever unneeded. To the best of the authors' knowledge,
   this is the first application of fuzzy logic to water spraying systems
   (or to any other controllable urban climate mitigation technology)
   targeting comfort and energy optimization. The prototype was field
   monitored in comparison with the conventional on-off control, in two
   Italian urban contexts (Cfa and Csa climatic zones) over 15 days in the
   hottest months of the year. The cooling and humidification action was
   thoroughly characterized by mapping both the horizontal and vertical
   profiles and by applying advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to
   spot the main environmental drivers. The maximum cooling (measured
   between the sprayed area and an undisturbed reference) touched 7.5
   degrees C and 6.14 degrees C in the two locations, respectively. The
   energy saving achieved under fuzzy control versus the temporized
   control, was spectacularly high in the wetter and windier location with
   an average of -51.2\% and a maximum of -67.5\%. The comfort benefit was
   also substantial: the temperature never deviated from neutrality by more
   than +/-2 degrees C, whereas with the on-off, this threshold was
   surpassed between the 14\% and the 20\% of the time by even more than 5
   degrees C. The results suggest that smartly controlled nebulization is
   an energy-efficient and comfort-effective strategy to counteract urban
   overheating. Furthermore, solar-powered solutions are well suited as
   proved by the preliminary design estimation we included.},

   intrusion in salt-wedge estuaries. The sea-level rise impacts are
   assessed in idealized estuaries using simple expressions derived from a
   two-layer hydraulic theory, and in the Neretva River Estuary in Croatia
   using a two-layer time-dependent model. The assessment is based on three
   indicators - the salt-wedge intrusion length, the seawater volume, and
   the river inflows needed to restore the baseline intrusion. The
   potential SLR was found to increase all three considered indicators.
   Theoretical analysis in idealized estuaries suggests that shallower
   estuaries are more sensitive to SLR. Numerical results for the Neretva
   River Estuary showed that SLR may increase salt-wedge intrusion length,
   volume, and corrective river inflow. However, the results are highly
   non-linear because of the channel geometry, especially for lower river
   inflows. A theoretical assessment of channel bed slope impacts on
   limiting a potential intrusion is therefore additionally discussed. This
   findings emphasize the need to use several different indicators when
   assessing SLR impacts.},

Abstract = {Seagrass meadows are important carbon sinks, and they are experiencing a
   global decline. Restoration of seagrass meadows provides a strategy to
   mitigate climate change while conserving these important ecosystems. We
   examined the long-term carbon sequestration expected for seagrass
   restoration programmes by developing a model that combined models of
   patch growth, patch survival in seagrass planting projects and estimates
   of seagrass CO2 sequestration per unit area for the five seagrass
   species commonly used in restoration programmes. The model results
   indicated that the cumulative C sequestered increased rapidly over time
   and with planting density to reach an asymptote at a planting density of
   100unitsha(-1) (or 6m spacing between units). At this planting density,
   the modelled cumulative C sequestered ranges from 177 to over
   1337tonsCO(2)ha(-1) after 50years. The value corresponding to this
   carbon sequestration suggests that the costs of seagrass restoration
   programmes may be fully recovered by the total CO2 captured in societies
   with a carbon tax in place, providing additional ecosystem services
   derived from the role of seagrasses in providing ecosystem services,
   such as enhanced biodiversity.Synthesis and applications. Seagrass
   restoration programmes are economically viable strategies to mitigate
   climate change through carbon sequestration, particularly in subtropical
   and tropical island states where land-based options have a limited
   scope.},

Title = {Assessing the capacity of seagrass meadows for carbon burial: Current
   limitations and future strategies},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {32-38},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows support high primary production rates and their
   canopies are efficient at filtering particles out of their water column
   as well as in preventing resuspension of the sediments. In addition,
   decomposition rates in seagrass sediments are slow, because of low
   nutrient concentration in seagrass detritus and low oxygen concentration
   in seagrass sediments. These characteristics result in high carbon
   burial rates in seagrass meadows, which have the capacity to accumulate
   large stores of carbon in their sediments, raising the seafloor. Carbon
   fingerprinting techniques allow to calculate both the age of these
   deposits and, therefore, the rate of carbon burial and identify the
   contribution of carbon produced by the seagrass. Yet, data on the
   regional cover and carbon stocks in seagrass meadows is sparse for some
   regions, particularly the Indo-Pacific, Africa and South America. In
   addition, our understanding of the factors regulating the variability in
   carbon sink capacity among seagrass meadows is limited. These gaps limit
   the capacity to formulate strategies to mitigate climate change based on
   the carbon sink capacity of seagrass meadows. A research strategy needs
   be formulated to address these gaps and provide the necessary protocols
   to ensure the accountability of mitigation actions involving the
   conservation and restoration of seagrass meadows. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The aim of this chapter to describe and explain the role of science
   communication as a method to advance environmental education on climate
   change with a special reference on Africa being one of the regions
   suffering from the effects of climate-induced disasters and risks in the
   increased anthropogenic effects of modern development. The overall
   impression globally and regionally is the scientists are poor
   communicators on what they do hence are often misunderstood by the media
   and society over the work they spend their life and effort doing. The
   buttressing methodological philosophy to this chapter is applied systems
   approach that views actors, processes, inputs and outputs of the climate
   change, policy and science as intricately related hence require a
   trans-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary approach.
   However, critical areas of reference are health and diseases, resilient
   communities, coastal adaptation and farming practices and technologies.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the context of climate change and sea-level rise, coastal realignment
   consists in reopening polders to marine waters to favor `nature-based'
   mitigation measures. Such operations have consequences on biodiversity,
   which vary depending on the parameters studied and site features. In
   this study, a multimetric indicator aiming to evaluate and predict the
   potential ecological quality of sites undergoing a realignment operation
   was developed. This indicator is based on the combination of two tools,
   (i) a biological-capacity matrix to assess the importance of different
   habitats of a defined typology for taxonomical, patrimonial and
   functional parameters; (ii) habitat maps obtained by photointerpretation
   for past habitats, by machine learning using space-borne imagery for
   present habitats and by forecasting using submersion models for future
   habitats. The indicator is presented in the form of a radar chart, with
   each axis corresponding to one parameter of the biological-capacity
   matrix and highlighting its different values for different
   coastal-realignment scenarios or different time horizons.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {This study examines the changes in monsoon rainfall of India using a
   suite of extreme indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change
   Detection Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI) to make the Indian results
   comparable internationally, in addition to the use of some relevant
   indices particularly developed for the Indian climate. To this end, the
   recently developed high resolution daily gridded (0.5 degrees x 0.5
   degrees) rainfall dataset for the period 1971-2005 has been analysed
   using robust nonparametric techniques. Despite the high interannual
   variability and spatial diversity of the Indian climatology, the results
   reveal signal of changes for several extreme rainfall indices, generally
   consistent with the simulated outcome of an intensified Indian monsoon
   rainfall in the context of global warming. A predominant decrease in wet
   days, moderate and total rainfall is observed in the high rainfall
   regions of northeast, central and southwest India. In the active monsoon
   months of July and August, the dry spells defined by the maximum length
   of consecutive dry days (CDD) have increased significantly over the
   north and central regions of India, suggesting a serious threat to the
   Indian agriculture. Simultaneously, the extreme rainfall indices, based
   on the percentile and absolute values, show increasing trends over large
   parts of the country. The probability density function (PDF) of several
   indices show noticeable changes since the 1990s over the homogeneous
   central and northeast parts of India. The indices representing the total
   monsoon rainfall and dry spells are better correlated with the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (NINO3.4), compared to that of the Indian
   Ocean Dipole Mode Index (IODMI). The mapping of the observed rainfall
   trends and their correspondence to the large scale circulation modes is
   expected to assist the policy makers to prioritize the mitigation and
   adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Defining thresholds for precautionary habitat management actions in a
   fisheries context},
Journal = {NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The use of precautionary management actions within a fisheries context
   has generally been limited to reducing fishing mortality. By the use of
   quantitative models, overfishing thresholds can be determined and
   actions can be taken to reduce the probability of further population
   declines and to allow rebuilding. Within this context, four management
   approaches have been defined (i.e., preventive approach, corrective
   approach, precautionary approach, and precautionary principle) on the
   basis of levels of uncertainty in the information used to make decisions
   and the potential cost of errors as a result of those decisions. In this
   paper, I apply these approaches to developing a precautionary and
   adaptive habitat management framework. Fishing effort metrics are used
   to develop estimates of the area of seafloor impacted by fishing, and
   thresholds are proposed to trigger specific types of management actions.
   Information needs include the cumulative area impacted by all gears, the
   distribution of habitats and diversity of key taxa, effects of gears on
   habitat and patterns of diversity, and linkages between habitat and the
   dynamics of exploited populations. Incentives for the fishing industry
   that will improve the information available to make decisions and reduce
   the level of precaution required for managing exploitation of wild
   populations are discussed. This framework is a starting point for
   management agencies to develop precautionary and adaptive habitat
   management programs that promote both the sustainability of exploited
   populations and the maintenance of biological diversity.},

Title = {Effects of Flood Control Strategies on Flood Resilience Under

Abstract = {A community capacity to cope with flood hazards, or community flood
   resilience, emerges from the interplay of hydrological and social
   processes. This interplay can be significantly influenced by the flood
   control strategy adopted by a society, i.e., how a society sets its
   desired flood protection level and strives to achieve this goal. And
   this interplay can be further complicated by rising land-sea level
   differences, seasonal water level fluctuations, and economic change. But
   not much research has been done on how various forms of flood control
   strategies affect human-flood interactions under these disturbances and
   therefore flood resilience in the long run. The current study is an
   effort to address these issues by developing a conceptual model of
   human-flood interaction mediated by flood control strategies. Our model
   extends the existing model of Yu et al. (2017), who investigated the
   flood resilience of a community-based flood protection system in coastal
   Bangladesh. The major extensions made in this study are inclusions of
   various forms of flood control strategies (both adaptive and nonadaptive
   ones), the challenge of rising land-sea level differences, and various
   high tide level scenarios generated from modifying the statistical
   variances and averages. Our results show that adaptive forms of flood
   control strategies tend to outperform nonadaptive ones for maintaining
   the model community's flood protection system. Adaptive strategies that
   dynamically adjust target flood protection levels through close
   monitoring of flood damages and social memories of flood risk can help
   the model community deal with various disturbances.},

Title = {Towards a multi-criteria methodology for assessment of geological carbon

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {74},

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) could achieve drastic cuts in the CO2
   emissions associated with fossil fuels in the near to medium term and
   has been promoted as a significant climate change mitigation option. As
   the profile of this family of technologies grows rapidly, there remain
   many uncertainties relating to its viability, effectiveness and
   desirability. In this paper we begin to map out some of the key issues
   associated with CCS, using a multi-criteria approach to explore how an
   (admittedly small) selection of stakeholders perceive alternative
   storage options and energy scenarios. We present five long-term
   scenarios describing alternative ways in which the UK energy system
   could develop and which deploy different levels of carbon storage. The
   key storage options considered are oil and gas fields (both disused and
   with enhanced oil recovery), traps in saline aquifers, saline aquifers
   outside traps and on-shore sites. The relative performance of the
   scenarios and the storage reservoirs included within them have been
   assessed against a set of socio-economic, technical and environmental
   criteria by a small selection of stakeholders to the carbon storage
   debate. Whilst we cannot make strong conclusions regarding precise
   stakeholder opinions at this stage due to the small size of the sample,
   the broad delineation of the arguments for and against CCS are evident.
   Multi-criteria assessment (MCA) appears to hold much potential as a
   useful tool for characterising and better understanding differences in
   stakeholder assessments of CCS and its implications, and for identifying
   options around which greater consensus on the desirability (or
   otherwise) of CCS as a mitigation strategy might emerge.},

Abstract = {Ecological thresholds have raised considerable interest as a concept

   ecological thresholds targeted at coastal and marine experts. The
   results show that experts are confident that coastal areas are affected
   by risks and changes related to ecological thresholds. Experts also are
   concerned that current coastal management structures and practices are
   not capable of preventing the crossing of the thresholds of harmful
   changes, especially those related to climate change. The results also
   show a high level of variability of views and suggest a need for the
   creation of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary platforms and

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Decision-making for climate adaptation operates in an uncertain
   environment. Formal processes to decision-making under uncertainty weigh
   the ability of a decision rule to achieve multiple and sometimes
   conflicting objectives in an evaluation procedure. Increasingly,
   computer simulation models are being applied for this reason, so that
   the effectiveness of decisions can be evaluated before actually
   implementing them in reality. In this paper, we develop a simple
   stochastic simulation model of beach recession under climate change in
   Australia and evaluate decision rules for beach replenishment in the
   context of three management objectives: (i) to reduce beach recession,
   (ii) reduce variation in beach recession, and (iii) do so
   cost-effectively. Results indicate that a decision to intervene and
   replenish the beach based on a trigger level would be effective at
   maintaining shoreline position, with relatively little variation, but
   did so at a relatively high cost of multiple interventions. A decision
   procedure to intervene at a fixed period resulted in greater shoreline
   position variation but constrained management efforts and costs. This
   structured approach offers an evidence-based process to decision-making
   that lays bare the assumptions upon which decisions are made. This, in
   turn, allows for a more complete analysis of all the uncertainties and
   better outcomes.},

Abstract = {Countries are implementing CO2 emission reduction targets in order to
   meet a globally agreed global warming limit of +2 degrees C. However, it
   was hypothesised that these national reduction targets are not
   translated to regional or state level planning, and are not considered
   through Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in order to meet
   emission reduction obligations falling on the transport, energy,
   housing, agriculture, and forestry sectors. SEAs of land use plans in
   the German state of Saxony, and the English region of the East of
   England were examined for their consideration of climate change impacts
   based on a set of criteria drawn from the literature. It was found that
   SEAs in both cases failed to consider climate change impacts at scales
   larger than the boundary of the spatial plan, and that CO2 reduction
   targets were not considered. This suggests a need for more clarity in
   the legal obligations for climate change consideration within the text
   of the SEA Directive, a requirement for monitoring of carbon emissions,
   a need for methodological guidance to devolve global climate change
   targets down to regional and local levels, and a need for guidance on
   properly implementing climate change protection in SEA. (C) 2011

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Pages = {999+},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sand dunes in arid regions are conspicuous mobile landforms that require
   adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect human infrastructure and
   economic assets from encroachment, and play a substantial role in
   desertification and atmospheric dust emissions. Here we show how the
   shape, migration speed and direction of mobile desert dunes globally are
   projected to change by 2100, in response to sand-moving wind regime
   shifts associated with climate change under the shared socio-economic
   pathway SSP5-8.5 (SSP, shared socio-economic pathway) scenario. We find
   transformations in dune dynamics for many sand seas and dune fields
   across the Sahara, The Horn of Africa, the Southern Arabian Peninsula,
   South Asia, China and Australia-as well as an increased potential for
   sand sea expansion and reactivation of dormant dune fields-linked to
   climate change alterations in the Hadley circulation, extra-tropical
   cyclone activity and monsoon systems. These projected changes will
   affect planning for and management of dune encroachment on
   transportation infrastructure, industry and urban development in desert
   regions.
   How sand dunes situated in arid areas change under warming is not well
   known. Here the authors assess predicted changes in sand-moving wind
   regimes and find that dune shapes, speeds and directions of movement
   will probably change in many regions, as well as the potential expansion
   of sand seas and a reactivation of currently dormant dune fields.},

Abstract = {The current Earth's energy imbalance (EEI) is mostly caused by human
   activity, and is driving global warming. The absolute value of EEI
   represents the most fundamental metric defining the status of global
   climate change, and will be more useful than using global surface
   temperature. EEI can best be estimated from changes in ocean heat
   content, complemented by radiation measurements from space. Sustained
   observations from the Argo array of autonomous profiling floats and
   further development of the ocean observing system to sample the deep
   ocean, marginal seas and sea ice regions are crucial to refining future
   estimates of EEI. Combining multiple measurements in an optimal way
   holds considerable promise for estimating EEI and thus assessing the
   status of global climate change, improving climate syntheses and models,
   and testing the effectiveness of mitigation actions. Progress can be
   achieved with a concerted international effort.},

Title = {Adaptation planning in large cities is unlikely to be effective},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {206},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The assessment of public adaptation policies, strategies and plans to
   evaluate progress, effectiveness and long-term sustainability is
   challenging. The potential to develop an ex-post evaluation linked to
   outcomes is limited given the lack of policy implementation globally and
   the uncertainty related to when and how impacts will happen. Ex-ante
   evaluations, by contrast, seem more feasible when they focus on policy
   processes, contents and outputs. Yet, proxies that indicate credible
   outcomes need to be carefully selected. In both cases, how adaptation is
   integrated in local planning processes, and previous experience by
   governments seem to be crucial. In this paper we perform an ex-ante
   evaluation of adaptation planning in 59 cities, identified across a set
   of 136 coastal cities of over 1 million inhabitants located in developed
   and developing world regions. We assess 3 major areas: policy and
   economic credibility, science and technical credibility, and legitimacy.
   Overall, 53 metrics are used to assess how likely local adaptation
   policies are to be effective, implemented and sustained in the
   long-term. This global assessment reveals that current adaptation
   planning in big global cities has a significant space for improvement
   and is, overall, unlikely to be effective unless greater effort is
   invested in financing, regulatory context, monitoring and evaluation,
   and legitimacy aspects. We also discuss challenges and needs, assuming
   this sample is representative of current progress of adaptation planning
   in large cities.},

Title = {Evaluation of promising technologies for soil salinity amelioration in
   Timpaki (Crete): a participatory approach},
Journal = {SOLID EARTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {177-190},
Abstract = {Soil salinity management can be complex, expensive, and time demanding,
   especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Besides taking no action,
   possible management strategies include amelioration and adaptation
   measures. Here we apply the World Overview of Conservation Approaches
   and Technologies (WOCAT) framework for the systematic analysis and
   evaluation and selection of soil salinisation amelioration technologies
   in close collaboration with stakeholders. The participatory approach is
   applied in the RECARE (Preventing and Remediating degradation of soils
   in Europe through Land Care) project case study of Timpaki, a semiarid
   region in south-central Crete (Greece) where the main land use is
   horticulture in greenhouses irrigated by groundwater. Excessive
   groundwater abstractions have resulted in a drop of the groundwater
   level in the coastal part of the aquifer, thus leading to seawater
   intrusion and in turn to soil salinisation. The documented technologies
   are evaluated for their impacts on ecosystem services, cost, and input
   requirements using a participatory approach and field evaluations.
   Results show that technologies which promote maintaining existing crop
   types while enhancing productivity and decreasing soil salinity are
   preferred by the stakeholders. The evaluation concludes that rainwater
   harvesting is the optimal solution for direct soil salinity mitigation,
   as it addresses a wider range of ecosystem and human well-being
   benefits. Nevertheless, this merit is offset by poor financial
   motivation making agronomic measures more attractive to users.},

Title = {How Ecosystem-Based Adaptation to Climate Change Can Help Coastal
   Communities through a Participatory Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal rural communities worldwide face many challenges not only
   related to climate change but also extreme events, environmental
   degradation, population growth or aging, and conflict usage of the
   ecosystem. Historically, the economies of coastal communities have been
   based on the exploitation of natural resources, thus shaping its
   socioeconomic development. This has led to some limitations in the way
   these communities can now adapt to climate change. In Canada, coastal
   communities are increasingly dealing with climate change consequences.
   Sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increasing frequency in storm
   surges threaten the fragility of both natural and human systems. Various
   approaches have been used to try to reduce the vulnerability and improve
   adaptive capacity of communities. One approach, promoted by many
   organizations including the United Nations, is ecosystem-based
   adaptation. This approach is part of the series of nature-based
   solutions that help social-ecological systems become more resilient; by
   promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, this
   approach also relates to principles of community engagement and supports
   adaptive governance and social inclusion. This paper describes and
   analyzes these principles and considers strategies for ensuring
   community engagement. Combining ecosystem-based adaptation with a strong
   community engagement can enhance the long-term sustainability of the
   social-ecological system.},

Title = {Capital, rules or conflict? Factors affecting livelihood-strategies,
   infrastructure-resilience, and livelihood-vulnerability in the polders
   of Bangladesh},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1169-1183},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal regions are most susceptible to the effects of climate change.
   To increase infrastructure-resilience of such regions, reduce
   livelihood-vulnerability of people living in such regions and equip them
   with appropriate livelihood strategies, governments have invested
   heavily in coastal infrastructure such as polders. This research is
   focused on the polders of Bangladesh. The effectiveness of Bangladesh's
   polders is disputed. No large-scale, evaluative, quantitative analysis
   of polders has yet been conducted. There is also only a limited number
   of evaluative studies on the factors which affect livelihood strategies,
   livelihood-vulnerability or infrastructure-resilience in polders.
   Therefore, the research question guiding this research is: What factors
   affect livelihood strategies, infrastructure-resilience, and
   livelihood-vulnerability in the polders of Bangladesh? These questions
   are answered by drawing on propositions from the Sustainable Livelihood
   Approach (SLA) using statistical analysis of a dataset of 137 polders.
   This dataset has been created from 76 survey-based interviews, secondary
   research and geo-spatial analysis. It is hypothesized that under
   different contextual settings, different combinations of livelihood
   resource endowments, lead to different combinations of livelihood
   strategies. These combinations of livelihood strategies lead to
   different outcomes after being moderated by different institutional, and
   political settings, under different contextual settings. This research
   demonstrates that various kinds of conflict-related and rule-making
   variables affect sustainability outcomes. Relationships proposed by the
   SLA are statistically significant and are generalizable across a large
   number of heterogeneous sites. Geological, geomorphological, climatic
   and hydrological conditions also affect livelihood decisions of
   polder-residents and also affect the condition of polder-infrastructure.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The distribution of risk of coastal inundation, and the potential
   benefits of adapting to protect against inundation, vary greatly both
   within and between coastal communities. This diversity is a result of
   physical factors, such as the risk of storm surge, sea level rise
   projections, and the topography of the landscape, as well as
   socio-economic factors, such as the level of development, and the
   capacity within the community to adapt. Despite this strong local
   variation, various communities share common characteristics that
   constrain or enable different adaptation options in different
   situations. Understanding these drivers is likely to be important in
   engaging coastal communities in the discussion around adaptation and may
   provide new insights into which adaptation options are suitable for each
   of our at-risk coastal communities. We performed a property-level
   analysis of 6 suburb-sized case studies distributed along the coast of
   Queensland, Australia. We assessed the potential economic costs of
   inundation events now and in the future under sea level rise
   projections, and the potential avoided costs following adaptation to
   protect against inundation. We went beyond this to estimate the
   distribution of risk in each community and compared the potential costs
   of adaptation with the capacity of the community to pay for their
   implementation. We used these insights to propose a typology of coastal
   communities based on their exposure to total inundation risk, the
   distribution of that risk within the community, and their capacity to
   adapt.},

Title = {Current stock situation and measures for the management and conservation
   of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Korean waters},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {164-168},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although minke whales in Korean waters have been protected for more than
   28 years after a commercial whaling moratorium in 1986, relatively
   little effort has been focused on assessing their current status of this
   population in this area after this protection and the efficacy of this
   protection. Thus, current stock situation and measures for the
   management and conservation of minke whales in Korean waters was
   investigated. Although Korea has undertaken significant efforts to
   archive the biological material of bycaught minke whales, the results
   remain incomplete. Furthermore, although a number of studies have
   reported the extent of bycaught minke whales, there has been little
   effort to reduce this occurrence in Korean waters compared with efforts
   to report it. Finally, there exists little data for investigating the
   effect of bycatch on the survival of minke whales in Korean waters. To
   improve weaknesses in the management of minke whales in Korean waters
   and to efficiently conserve and manage this population, the following
   efforts are urgently needed: 1) Conduct research on minke whales
   including satellite tagging; 2) Establish DNA registers for all minke
   whale bycatch, market surveys and intensive control of illegal catch; 3)
   Assess the usefulness of several mitigation measures to reduce bycatch
   (pingers, fishing gear modifications and time-area closures), and apply
   these measures; 4) Assess the effect of bycatch on the survival of minke
   whales in Korean waters; 5) Reduce the incentive for bycaught minke
   whales and use it as research funds for minke whales and incentives for
   releasing entrapped or entangled whale in fishing gears; 6) Compare with
   other studies on the management suggestions to modify the current stock
   situation. Among these suggestions to modify the current stock
   situation, the application of bycatch mitigation measures and intensive
   control of illegal catch are expected to efficiently improve the current
   stock situation of minke whales in Korean waters by reducing bycatch and
   illegal catch. Particularly, among bycatch mitigation measures, fishing
   gear modification and pinger are considered as efficient management
   suggestions for this stock in this area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The human-pathogenic marine bacteria Vibrio vulnificus and V.
   parahaemolyticus are strongly correlated with water temperature, with
   concentrations increasing as waters warm seasonally. Both of these
   bacteria can be concentrated in filter-feeding shellfish, especially
   oysters. Because oysters are often consumed raw, this exposes people to
   large doses of potentially harmful bacteria. Various models are used to
   predict the abundance of these bacteria in oysters, which guide
   shellfish harvest policy meant to reduce human health risk. Vibrio
   abundance and behaviour varies from site to site, suggesting that
   location-specific studies are needed to establish targeted risk
   reduction strategies. Moreover, virulence potential, rather than simple
   abundance, should be also be included in future modeling efforts.},

Abstract = {Management tools are needed to help regulate the international trade in
   seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) under the Convention on International Trade
   in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora. Given the limited
   understanding of seahorse population dynamics and fishing mortality, a
   single minimum size limit for all seahorse species appears to be a
   useful initial step toward adaptive management, both biologically and
   socially. We collected data on maximum height and size at first maturity
   for 32 seahorse species and cross-validated the data with results from
   an analysis across marine teleosts. A minimum height restriction of 10
   cm would permit, based on calculated data, reproduction in 15 species
   before they recruited to the fishery. Of the remaining 17 species, 16
   were essentially not in international trade, were safeguarded under
   domestic legislation, or were partly protected by this size limit. Only
   one species, H. kelloggi, was not well served by the 10-cm minimum size
   limit. The CITES technical committee on animals has now decided to
   propose this single size limit to all 167 signatory nations as one
   option toward sustainable trade. Complementary management measures for
   seahorses are also required, particularly for populations primarily
   exploited in bycatch.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is emerged as a ubiquitous phenomenon that
   affects the outdoor thermal comfort. Hence urban microclimatic studies
   using numeric simulation software to find out adaption strategies are
   attracting the great attention of researchers and policymaker. Number of
   scientists carried out their research on this topic using different
   tools and technique whereas ENVI-met model is the most widely used
   simulation tools. The present study intended to examine the implication
   of green infrastructure of the town on enhanced microclimatic condition
   and to evaluate the best suitable mitigation strategy modelling cool
   city with ENVI-met software (V4). Five greening condition such as
   existing UHI condition (C1), 100\% greening of roof (C2), 100\% greening
   of roof and walls (C3), 50\% greening of roof and walls (C4) and:
   Plantation at suitable area with 50\% greening of roof and walls (C5)
   have been taken into consideration for the microclimate simulation for
   all three selected sites. Among these five conditions, C3 for the open
   mid-rise and compact low-rise, C5 for the open low-rise are identified
   as one of the most suitable strategies which can reduce the air
   temperature of peak hours by 2.6 degrees C, 1.33 degrees C and 1.87
   degrees C respectively. These models are validated by simple linear
   regression between simulated and existing air temperature in case of
   existing UHI condition (C1) and in all the cases coefficient of
   determination value is high such as for open mid-rise, compact low-rise
   and open low-rise, it is 0.92, 0.92 and 0.75 respectively. Therefore it
   can be concluded that the application of those strategies can improve
   the urban thermal environment as well as the outdoor thermal comfort of
   English bazaar Town and its surroundings. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition is a major cause of plant biodiversity loss,
   with serious implications for appropriate management of protected sites.
   Reducing N emissions is the only long-term solution. However, on-site
   management has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse effects of
   N deposition. In this paper we review how management activities such as
   grazing, cutting, burning, hydrological management and soil disturbance
   measures can mitigate the negative impacts of N across a range of
   temperate habitats (acid, calcareous and neutral grasslands, sand dunes
   and other coastal habitats, heathlands, bogs and fens). The review
   focuses mainly on European habitats, which have a long history of N
   deposition, and it excludes forested systems. For each management type
   we distinguish between actions that improve habitat suitability for
   plant species of conservation importance, and actions that immobilize N
   or remove it from the system. For grasslands and heathlands we collate
   data on the quantity of N removal by each management type. Our findings
   show that while most activities improve habitat suitability, the
   majority do little to slow or to reduce the amount of N accumulating in
   soil pools at current deposition rates. Only heavy cutting/mowing with
   removal in grasslands, high intensity burns in heathlands and sod
   cutting remove more N than comes in from deposition under typical
   management cycles. We conclude by discussing some of the unintended
   consequences of managing specifically for N impacts, which can include
   damage to non-target species, alteration of soil processes, loss of the
   seedbank and loss of soil carbon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) has been described as one of the greatest potential
   causes of ecosystem disruption, putting many coastal areas at risk of
   irreversible changes. However, the loss of intertidal areas from SLR and
   the associated ecological and social repercussions receive little
   attention. Within estuaries, extensive intertidal areas harbour a
   variety of habitats and communities and represent hotspots of ecosystem
   functions. Any changes to their distribution or extent are likely to
   have far reaching implications. Here we summarise the ecological
   consequences of a reduction in intertidal area from increasing SLR, and
   the implications for people, management and planning. To facilitate this
   discussion, changes in the occurrence and abundance of two ecologically
   and culturally important intertidal shellfish species (Austrovenus
   stutchburyi and Macomona liliana) were modelled under different SLR
   scenarios for Tauranga Harbour, Aotearoa New Zealand. We highlight how
   the squeezing of intertidal areas will likely alter the distribution and
   extent of key habitats and communities, and discuss the implications for
   coastal food webs, ecosystem functioning and service provision.
   Pre-emptive planning and adaptive management are needed that incorporate
   ecological losses in risk assessments and focuses on pro-active
   solutions to increase resilience to the effects of SLR.},

   megacities},
Journal = {ERDE},

Volume = {150},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {118-130},
Abstract = {The search for suitable adaptation pathways to accommodate for rising
   sea levels resulting from global climate change is an ongoing concern
   for many megacities in Southeast Asia and beyond. Addressing already
   existing challenges resulting from land subsidence and increased
   occurrence of inland flooding, adaptation can take varied forms and
   cover widely differing concerns, spaces and time spans. Based on
   research carried out in the cities of Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia),
   and Manila (Philippines), this paper looks at some key trajectories of
   current adaptation planning. We argue that the processes of
   infrastructuring coastal futures in these cities are characterized by
   different aims and measures that overlap and converge in their material
   effects but also compete in articulating diverging new claims to the
   coast. In this perspective, we describe and analyze three main trends of
   infrastructuring coastal futures: the securitization of coastal futures
   by way of transforming disaster risk reduction practices and integrating
   new policy concerns, the greening of coastal spaces in material and
   operational terms, and finally, the valorization of coastal areas
   through reclamation, waterfront development and the creation of high-end
   real estate. Along these three trajectories, coastal adaptation planning
   becomes a key force that can influence virtually every sector of urban
   development and governance, and has strong implications for the futures
   of coastal cities in social and political terms.},

Abstract = {Background: Meteorological disasters are an important component when
   considering climate change issues that impact morbidity and mortality
   rates. However, there are few epidemiological studies assessing the
   causes and characteristics of deaths from meteorological disasters. The
   present study aimed to analyze the causes of death associated with
   meteorological disasters in Korea, as well as demographic and geographic
   vulnerabilities and their changing trends, to establish effective
   measures for the adaptation to meteorological disasters.
   Methods: Deaths associated with meteorological disasters were examined
   from 2,045 cases in Victim Survey Reports prepared by 16 local
   governments from 1990 to 2008. Specific causes of death were categorized
   as drowning, structural collapse, electrocution, lightning, fall,
   collision, landslide, avalanche, deterioration of disease by disaster,
   and others. Death rates were analyzed according to the meteorological
   type, specific causes of death, and demographic and geographic
   characteristics.
   Results: Drowning (60.3\%) caused the greatest number of deaths in
   total, followed by landslide (19.7\%) and structural collapse (10.1\%).
   However, the causes of deaths differed between disaster types. The
   meteorological disaster associated with the greatest number of deaths
   has changed from flood to typhoon. Factors that raised vulnerability
   included living in coastal provinces (11.3 times higher than inland
   metropolitan), male gender (1.9 times higher than female), and older
   age.
   Conclusions: Epidemiological analyses of the causes of death and
   vulnerability associated with meteorological disasters can provide the
   necessary information for establishing future adaptation measures
   against climate change. A more comprehensive system for assessing
   disaster epidemiology needs to be established.},

Abstract = {Freshwater aquaculture plays an important role in the economy of
   Bangladesh, providing food, income, livelihoods and export earnings.
   However, freshwater aquaculture in the Mymensingh area of north-central
   Bangladesh has been accompanied by recent concerns over climate change.
   Field survey revealed that different climatic variables including flood,
   drought, rainfall variation and temperature fluctuation have had adverse
   effects on pond-fish culture. These climatic variables have detrimental
   effects on the ecosystem of ponds and thus affect survival, growth and
   production of fish. Changes in climatic variables have adverse effects
   on fish reproduction, grow-out operation, parasite infestation and
   disease occurrence. Considering vulnerability to the effects of climate
   change on pond-fish culture, we propose adaptation strategies that need
   to be introduced to cope with the challenges.},

Abstract = {China is the third largest Country (after Russia and Canada) extending
   from the West Pacific Ocean to the Tibet plateau, where the climate
   ranges from the monsoonal regime in the east to the extreme dryness in
   the west, and from tropical in the south to subarctic in the north.
   Traditionally, a large part of the population is dedicated to the
   agriculture, with a high percentage continuously migrating towards the
   industrial coastal areas. In this perspective, water represents a
   precious resource for living, industries and farming, and its scarcity,
   due to climate changes and variability, is an overwhelming problem for
   the entire community. Therefore it is fundamental to have a clear
   picture of the climate changes and trends undergoing in different
   regions of this vast and varied country. Moreover, understanding the
   climate variability in China will certainly give important hints on the
   trends of the vegetation, and, therefore, on the role of Chinese
   ecosystems in the global carbon cycle and global climate change, while
   the assessment of the impact of land-use changes on the local and
   regional climate will help in adaptation strategies.
   In this paper we present results on the climate analysis in selected
   regions, and on the climate variability affecting the water cycle and
   the land productivity.},

Title = {Barriers to climate change adaptation in indigenous communities: A case
   study on the mohawk community of Kanesatake, Canada},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {49},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The switch from climate change mitigation to the adaptation to its
   impacts or effects initially appears to be a promising strategy.
   Academics and practitioners, however, confront limits and barriers to
   the adaptation both in theory and practice. Despite the extensive
   efforts in understanding limits and barriers, little is still known
   about political and institutional barriers, more specifically political
   challenges in Indigenous communities that typically nullify the effect
   of adaptation strategies. This study investigates the experience of the
   Mohawk community of Kanesatake, a First Nations community in Canada,
   during and after the 2017 and the 2019 floods in Quebec. Results reveal
   the links between the proximate set of barriers and historical,
   political pressures in Indigenous communities. Findings explain that
   unhealed wounds in relationships among nations generate political and
   institutional hurdles, which eventually orchestrate the co-occurrence of
   multiple barriers: the lack of land ownership rights, insurance, and
   social institutions such as police force and firefighters, to name a
   few. Findings have implications both for theory and practice. In theory,
   the findings reveal the fact that barriers are not mutually exclusive;
   in fact, they are often interdependent. In practice, findings support
   the fact that policies fail if they disregard underlying
   interdependencies.},

Title = {Modeling the outdoor cooling impact of highly radiative ``super cool{''}
   materials applied on roofs},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Highly reflective ``cool materials{''} are commonly used to reduce
   temperatures in the urban environment. Recently developed ``super
   cool{''} materials feature an even higher albedo and emissivity (both
   above 0.95) than traditional cool materials. To examine the impacts of
   super cool roofing materials on outdoor air temperature compared to
   traditional cool roofs and green roofs, we conduct a sensitivity study
   with the microclimate model ENVI-met. Simulated surface temperature of
   super cool roofs remained around 6 K below ambient air temperature
   during high solar irradiation, which is consistent with observations.
   Super cool roofs - with an averaged street-level air temperature cooling
   of around 0.85 K in times of high solar radiation - provided 0.1 to 0.15
   K more cooling than commonly used cool roofs and green roofs. Results
   also showed that super cool roofs could lower pedestrian-level air
   temperatures in some areas by up to 2.4 K. However, spatial analysis
   demonstrated that cooler air from roof level blocks the vertical air
   exchange of street canyons. Finally, the street-level cooling
   performance of all three roof types is predicted to decrease
   non-linearly with increasing building height by around 0.003 K per meter
   and to cease at building heights of around 100 m.},

Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Owing to amplified impacts on human society and ecosystems, compound
   events (or extremes) have attracted ample attention in recent decades.
   China is particularly vulnerable to compound events due to the fast
   warming rate, dense populations, and fragile ecological environment.
   Recent studies have demonstrated tangible effects of climate change on
   compound events with mounting impacts on the economy, agriculture,
   public health, and infrastructure in China, posing unprecedented threats
   that are increasingly difficult to manage. Here, I synthesize recent
   progress in studies of compound events and associated impacts in China.
   Several lines of evidence indicate an increase in the frequency and
   intensity of multiple types of compound events across China. Future
   directions in studying compound events in China are suggested, including
   investigating extremes from a compound perspective, modeling compound
   events in the Anthropocene, quantitative evaluations of risks, and
   holistic adaptation measures of compound events.},

Title = {Shifting habitats expose fishing communities to risk under climate
   change},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Pages = {512+},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to have a profound impact on the
   distribution, abundance and diversity of marine species globally(1,2).
   These ecological impacts of climate change will affect human communities
   dependent on fisheries for livelihoods and well-being(3). While methods
   for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change are rapidly
   developing(4) and socio-ecological vulnerability assessments for
   fisheries are becoming available(5), there has been less work devoted to
   understanding how impacts differ across fishing communities. We
   developed a linked socio-ecological approach to assess the exposure of
   fishing communities to risk from climate change, and present a case
   study of New England and Mid-Atlantic (USA) fishing communities. We
   found that the northern part of the study region was projected to gain
   suitable habitat and the southern part projected to lose suitable
   habitat for many species, but the exposure of fishing communities to
   risk was strongly dependent on both their spatial use of the ocean and
   their portfolio of species caught. A majority of fishing communities
   were projected to face declining future fishing opportunities unless
   they adapt, either through catching new species or fishing in new
   locations. By integrating climatic, ecological and socio-economic data
   at a scale relevant to fishing communities, this analysis identifies
   where strategies for adapting to the ecological impacts of climate
   change will be most needed.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a major threat for ecosystems, food security, forests
   and other natural resources. Proper steps must be taken to reduce the
   vulnerability of the farming communities living in coastal areas,
   especially in the developing countries. This chapter reviews the impact
   of climate change on the coastal agro-ecosystem, and practices to
   improve sustainability. We found that 27 countries are the most
   vulnerable due to accelerated sea level rise. In some coastal areas, up
   to 40\% biodiversity loss has already been observed. About 70\% income
   is generated from crop cultivation and the rest is from fisheries and
   other animal husbandry activities. Hence, climate resilient agriculture
   can secure the rural livelihood. Adaptation measures may include
   agro-forestry practices, establishment of orchards, nutrient recycling,
   salinity management and rational use of water. Techniques of climate
   resilient agriculture vary with techniques available, needs of the

Title = {Challenges and opportunities for food systems in a changing climate: A
   systematic review of climate policy integration},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {485-495},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The compounding effects of climate change on food systems have led
   researchers into developing approaches aimed at understanding the
   multiple trade-offs and synergies associated to dealing with climate
   change. As countries continue to develop climate policies, in particular
   adaptation strategies, it is evident that these need to be articulated
   more effectively across multiple policy domains and jurisdictions.
   Climate policy integration is often sought to improve policy coherence
   and climate governance at different scales. The aim of this paper is to
   better understand to what degree climate policy integration is being
   achieved and what are the common barriers and enablers. Additional
   emphasis is placed on identifying challenges and opportunities
   specifically relevant to food systems and the attainment of food
   security goals. The study was conducted using the PRISMA Statement and
   four-phase diagram for reporting results of systematic reviews. The
   dataset analysed included 209 peerreview articles published in the
   period 2010-2020. The review shows that although climate policy
   integration is increasingly discussed as a preferred strategy to deal
   more effectively with complex and multiple policy domains, existing
   institutional and governance structures pose barriers to the effective
   integration of climate goals across sectors, approaches and
   jurisdictions. There are specific opportunities and challenges for food
   systems and food security. Among these opportunities are the conceptual
   compatibility which can be derived from land-use strategies that
   generate synergies between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable
   development goals. In addition, the agricultural sector has often
   developed vertical structures for the delivery of support services which
   can be utilized to facilitate vertical integration and implementation of
   strategies. In contrast, the legislative legacy and often complicated
   processes of policy layering, drift and conversion in land-use sectors
   challenge the achievement of policy coherence.},

Title = {Enhancement of Non-photochemical Quenching as an Adaptive Strategy under
   Phosphorus Deprivation in the Dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Intensified water column stratification due to global warming has the
   potential to decrease nutrient availability while increasing excess
   light for the photosynthesis of phytoplankton in the euphotic zone,
   which together will increase the need for photoprotective strategies
   such as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). We investigated whether NPQ
   is enhanced and how it is regulated molecularly under phosphorus (P)
   deprivation in the dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum. We grew K.
   veneficum under P-replete and P-depleted conditions, monitored their
   growth rates and chlorophyll fluorescence, and conducted gene expression
   and comparative proteomic analyses. The results were used to
   characterize NPQ modulation and associated gene expression dynamics
   under P deprivation. We found that NPQ in K. veneficum was elevated
   significantly under P deprivation. Accordingly, the abundances of three
   light-harvesting complex stress-related proteins increased under
   P-depleted condition. Besides, many proteins related to genetic
   information flow were down-regulated while many proteins related to
   energy production and conversion were up-regulated under P deprivation.
   Taken together, our results indicate that K. veneficum cells respond to
   P deprivation by reconfiguring the metabolic landscape and up-tuning NPQ
   to increase the capacity to dissipate excess light energy and maintain
   the fluency of energy flow, which provides a new perspective about what
   adaptive strategy dinoflagellates have evolved to cope with P
   deprivation.},

Title = {Exploring Methodological Approaches for Strengthening the Resilience of
   Coastal Flood Protection System},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Coastlines are subject to multiple developments related to land use
   planning and the effects of climate change. These developments generally
   lead to an increase in the risk of coastal flooding. This article
   focuses on systems to protect against this hazard, and presents a
   bibliographical analysis on methods and operational tools to strengthen
   their resilience. This analysis is carried out by considering that a
   system of protection is a component of the territory to which it
   provides protection and that it is therefore necessary to study in depth
   the relations between this system and the various components of the
   territory (the natural environment, the built environment and the social
   and institutional environment). Based on this hypothesis, the concepts
   of risk and resilience applied to floods are specified and the
   protection and adaptation strategies commonly used in recent decades are
   described. This retrospective on concepts and strategies leads us to
   structure the state-of-the-art analysis on methods and operational tools
   in relation to two issues: 1) understanding risks; 2) adapting and
   transforming protection systems. In each case, the use of the concept of
   resilience implies a clear distinction between systemic and analytical
   approaches. Finally, this bibliographical analysis reveals the need to
   revise the protection system concept in order to promote the integration
   of these systems in the territories. Accordingly, new methodological
   developments could be considered using ecosystem and socio-economic
   approaches.},

Title = {Dendroecology in common gardens: Population differentiation and

   events in Pinus pinaster},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {291},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Quantifying intraspecific genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity of
   traits involved in drought tolerance is essential to forecast forest
   tree vulnerability to climate change. Tree ring analysis was applied to
   retrospectively assess the resistance, recovery and resilience of a
   Mediterranean pine in the face of extreme climate episodes. We combined
   a dendrochronological approach with the analysis of common-garden tests
   to disentangle genetic, environment and genetic-by-environment effects
   in growth responses of 10 P. pinaster populations to two extreme
   climatic events. Trees were 43 years old and had experienced two intense
   droughts, in 1995 and 2005. Drought events caused drastic reductions in
   secondary growth, but trees showed high capacity to recover predrought
   growth rates. The differences in the characteristics of the two drought
   events and the environmental distance between sites strongly modulated
   maritime pine responses to extreme droughts. However, a common
   among-population signal across sites and events was detected in the
   drought response strategy. Among-population variation in response to
   extreme droughts was evident for the resistance and recovery components,
   two strategies that appeared to trade-off between each other.
   Populations from Atlantic climates showed higher resistance but lower
   recovery capacity, whereas Mediterranean origins prioritised recovery
   over resistance. Mediterranean populations showed a more conservative
   strategy that indicated an adaptive advantage under water stress,
   reflected in greater long-term survival. The abovementioned
   relationships were clear in the site where the impact of the drought
   events was strongest, but not in the more favourable site. Differences
   in relationships between sites reflect that strategies of populations to
   cope with drought are strongly context dependent. Based on these
   results, we infer that future extreme droughts will differentially
   affect P. pinaster populations across the natural range of the species.
   Immediate effects will be more evident in Mediterranean areas but, in
   the long term, population persistence in the face of climate change will
   be more compromised for Atlantic origins. Because local environmental
   conditions can considerably modulate responses to extreme events,
   special attention is required to define appropriate management practices
   to mitigate the impact of future droughts.},

Title = {Understanding Preferences for Coastal Climate Change Adaptation: A
   Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Lack of public support for coastal adaptation can present significant
   barriers for implementation. In response, policy makers and academics
   are seeking strategies to build public support for coastal adaptation,
   which requires a deeper understanding of peoples' preferences for
   coastal adaptation and what motives those preferences. Here, we conduct
   a systematic literature review to understand preferences for coastal
   adaptation options and the factors influencing these preferences. Ninety
   peer-reviewed publications meet the inclusion criteria. The findings
   revealed that hard protection options were often the most frequently
   preferred, likely due to a desire to maintain current shoreline, for the
   protection of recreational spaces and private property, and a perceived
   effectiveness of hard protection options. Soft protection, including
   nature-based approaches, accommodation, and no action were the next most
   preferred options. Finally, retreat options were the least preferred,
   often due to strong place attachment. We identify twenty-eight factors
   that could influence preferences, with risk perception, place
   attachment, and financial considerations occurring most frequently in
   the literature. In the conclusion, we outline the most significant
   research gaps identified from our analysis and discuss the implication
   for adaptation research and practice.},

   shells of oysters and other shelled organisrns have been attributed to
   increased salinization of estuarine ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis
   that fouling by boring sponges will change the interaction strength
   between oysters and a common predator (stone crabs). We generated five
   oyster density treatments crossed with two sponge treatments (sponge and
   no sponge). We contrasted the interaction strength between stone crabs
   and fouled and non-fouled oysters by comparing the parameters of fitted
   functional response curves based on Rogers random predation model. We
   found that fouled oysters suffered higher predation from stone crabs,
   and that the increased predation risk stemmed from a reduction in the
   handling time needed to consume the fouled oysters. These findings
   highlight the importance of understanding the effects of abiotic changes
   on both the composition of ecological communities, and on the strengths
   of direct and indirect interactions among species. Global climate change
   is altering local ecosystems in complex ways, and the success of
   restoration, management, and mitigation strategies for important species
   requires a better appreciation for how these effects cascade through
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Urban heat is a growing environmental concern in cities around the
   world. The urban heat island effect, combined with warming effects of
   climate change, is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and
   intensity of extreme heat events. Alterations to the physical, built
   environment are a viable option for mitigating urban heat, yet few
   studies provide systematic guidance to practitioners for adapting
   diverse land uses. In this study, we examine the use of green
   infrastructure treatments to evaluate changes in ambient temperatures
   across diverse land uses in the city of Portland, Oregon. We apply
   ENVI-met((R)) microclimate modeling at the city-block scale specifically
   to determine what built environment characteristics are most associated
   with high temperatures, and the extent to which different physical
   designs reduce ambient temperature. The analysis included six green
   infrastructure interventions modeled across six different land-use
   types, and indicated the varying degrees to which approaches are
   effective. Results were inconsistent across landscapes, and showed that
   one mitigation solution alone would not significantly reduce extreme
   heat. These results can be used to develop targeted, climate- and
   landscape-specific cooling interventions for different land uses, which
   can help to inform and refine current guidance to achieve urban climate
   adaptation goals.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For the neighbourhood scale a decomposition of the urban heat island
   (UHI) intensity (Delta T) into its contributing processes is suggested.
   The approach translates individual terms of the energy balance
   (radiation, evapotranspiration, heat storage, and convection) into
   temperature increments. This is exemplified using micrometeorological
   simulations (ENVI-met) for the quarter ``Bayerischer Bahnhof{''} in
   Leipzig, Germany, under different wind conditions. In result heat
   storage and convection provide the principal contributions to UHI. The
   mapping of Delta T-contributions in a neighbourhood is a new tool
   facilitating the development of tailored measures for reduction of and
   adaptation to urban heat. For example, the Delta T-contributions (-6.8,
   -2.6, -9.2, and 15.7 K, respectively) calculated for a courtyard
   compensate each other. Applying this decomposition at each individual
   location, suitable adaptation measures can be developed. Considering the
   superposition of all local Delta T-contributions can support a
   cost-benefit analysis creating optimal recommendations for city
   planners.},

Abstract = {Southeastern pineland ecosystems fall into two broad groups: ecosystems

   We review the fire ecology and management of these ecosystems, covering
   weather, climate, fuels, and fire; historical fire regimes; fire
   associated tree mortality; fire dependency and postfire recovery;
   wildlife response to fire; and fire and ecological restoration. Finally,
   we discuss likely impacts of future climate changes and mitigation

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {The eucheumatoidsKappaphycusandEucheumaare cultivated in tropical or
   subtropical regions for the production of carrageenan, a hydrocolloid
   widely used in the food and cosmetic industries.Kappaphycus alvareziiis
   a highly valued economic crop in the Coral Triangle, with the
   Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia ranked among the largest producers.
   In the absence of measures to mitigate climate change, extreme events
   including heatwaves, typhoons, severe El Nino and La Nina, are expected
   to increase in frequency and magnitude. This inadvertently brings
   adverse effects to the seaweed cultivation industry, especially in the
   tropics. Temperatures are rapidly reaching the upper limit of
   biologically tolerable levels and an increase in reports ofice-iceand
   pest outbreaks is attributable to these shifts of environmental
   parameters. Nevertheless, few reports on the response of eucheumatoids
   to a changing environment, in particular global warming, are available.
   Understanding the responses and possible mechanisms for acclimation to
   warming is crucial for a sustainable seaweed cultivation industry. Here,
   the physiological and biochemical responses ofK.alvareziito acute
   warming indicated that the strain used in the current study is unlikely
   to survive sudden increases in temperature above 36 degrees C. As
   temperature increased, the growth rates, photosynthetic performance,
   phycocolloid quality (carrageenan yield, gel strength and gel viscosity)
   and pigment content (chlorophyll-a, carotenoid and phycobiliproteins)
   were reduced while the production of reactive oxygen species increased
   indicating the occurrence of stress in the seaweeds. This study provides
   a basis for future work on long term acclimation to elevated temperature
   and mesocosm-based multivariate studies to identify heat-tolerant
   strains for sustainable cultivation.},

Abstract = {In the 21st century, accelerated sea-level rise and continued coastal
   development are expected to greatly alter coastal landscapes across the
   globe. Historically, many coastal ecosystems have responded to sea-level
   fluctuations via horizontal and vertical movement on the landscape.
   However, anthropogenic activities, including urbanization and the
   construction of flood-prevention infrastructure, can produce barriers
   that impede ecosystem migration. Here we show where tidal saline
   wetlands have the potential to migrate landward along the northern Gulf
   of Mexico coast, one of the most sea-level rise sensitive and
   wetland-rich regions of the world. Our findings can be used to identify
   migration corridors and develop sea-level rise adaptation strategies to
   help ensure the continued availability of wetland-associated ecosystem
   goods and services.},

Abstract = {Ongoing coastal development and the prospect of severe climate change
   impacts present pressing estuary management and governance challenges.
   Robust approaches must recognise the intertwined social and ecological
   vulnerabilities of estuaries. Here, a new governance and management
   framework is proposed that recognises the integrated social-ecological
   systems of estuaries so as to permit transformative adaptation to
   climate change within these systems. The framework lists stakeholders
   and identifies estuarine uses and values. Goals are categorised that are
   specific to ecosystems, private property, public infrastructure, and
   human communities. Systematic adaptation management strategies are
   proposed with conceptual examples and associated governance approaches.
   Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate the practical
   application of these ideas. The framework will assist estuary managers
   worldwide to achieve their goals, minimise maladaptative responses,
   better identify competing interests, reduce stakeholder conflict and
   exploit opportunities for appropriate ecosystem restoration and
   sustainable development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Geological disasters in coastal cities of China include land subsidence,
   karst collapse, seawater intrusion, coast erosion, collapse, landslide,
   mud-rock flow, soil erosion, and man-made disasters due to construction.
   All these disasters have their own happening reasons, characteristics,
   and distribution region. Land subsidence, seawater intrusion, and coast
   erosion are very serious because of special characteristics in the
   coastal cities of China. Prevention and control of geological disasters
   should be improved in coastal cities of China. Because populations are
   dense and economy are prosperous in the coastal cities, economical loss
   and personnel casualty caused by geological disasters are very large.},

Title = {Using GIS fuzzy-set modelling to integrate social-ecological data to
   support overall resilience in marine protected area spatial planning: A
   case study},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are useful conservation tools for
   balancing the complex social-ecological interactions and demands within
   a given marine area. Often designing, reviewing, and assessing existing
   MPAs can be a complicated task often based on patchy ecological data,
   biases towards certain stakeholder groups, and static snapshots of
   current information. Taking a social-ecological resilience approach,
   this study has developed an innovative way of using fuzzy-set
   multi-criteria evaluations in GIS modelling to integrate existing
   ecological data for a marine area with information from a diverse set of
   stakeholders to gain an understanding of the overlaps between social and
   ecological assets within an MPA. Adaptive management frameworks were
   considered by exploring stakeholder feedback in regards to the current
   spatial plan and using a social-ecological spatially informed Bayesian
   Belief Network (BBN) analysis to create a current snapshot of the MPA's
   vulnerability. The BBN was then used to predict how climate change may
   affect sensitive habitats and demonstrates the increase of vulnerability
   for both habitats and marine species when allowing fishing pressure to
   occur across the entire MPA. A series of decision-making maps were
   created that integrated all of this information. Using this current and
   predicted social-ecological spatial information about an MPA, can assist
   decision-makers and the local community by giving them the tools to make
   informed decisions about how to better design an MPA that meets and
   supports long-term social-ecological resilience.},

Abstract = {Climate change can cause significant (un)foreseen changes in the
   fisheries sector. However, adaptation has the potential to moderate some
   of the impacts. This paper explores the challenges faced by both
   freshwater and marine fisheries sector in addressing climate change and
   teases out intervention measures from 21 African countries. The paper
   uses document analysis and draws selected analysis parameters from the
   grounded theory. The data are obtained from the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change National Communication reports. Among the
   key adaptation measures emerging from the analysis are: fish breeding,
   integrated coastal management, putting in place appropriate policies,
   water and flood management as well as research and development. The
   study concludes that adaptation in the African fisheries sector should
   be prioritised, an aspect that could also apply elsewhere in the world
   to enhance food security.},

Abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently

   given for global-mean warming in the absence of policies to limit
   climate change. The full warming range over 1990 to 2100, 1.4 degrees to
   5.8 degreesC, is substantially higher than the range given previously in
   the IPCC Second Assessment Report. Here we interpret the new warming
   range in probabilistic terms, accounting for uncertainties in emissions,
   the climate sensitivity, the carbon cycle, ocean mixing, and aerosol
   forcing. We show that the probabilities of warming values at both the
   high and Low ends of the TAR range are very Low. In the absence of
   climate-mitigation policies, the 90\% probability interval for 1990 to
   2100 warming is 1.7 degrees to 4.9 degreesC.},

Journal = {BIOSCIENCE},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Tropical beaches provide coastal flood protection, income from tourism,
   and habitat for flagship species. They urgently need protection from
   erosion, which is being exacerbated by changing climate and coastal
   development. Traditional coastal engineering solutions are expensive,
   provide unstable temporary solutions, and often disrupt natural sediment
   transport. Instead, natural foreshore stabilization and nourishment may
   provide a sustainable and resilient long-term solution. Field flume and
   ecosystem process measurements, along with data from the literature,
   show that sediment stabilization by seagrass in combination with
   sediment-producing calcifying algae in the foreshore form an effective
   mechanism for maintaining tropical beaches worldwide. The long-term
   efficacy of this type of nature-based beach management is shown at a
   large scale by comparing vegetated and unvegetated coastal profiles. We
   argue that preserving and restoring vegetated beach foreshore ecosystems
   offers a viable, self-sustaining alternative to traditional engineering
   solutions, increasing the resilience of coastal areas to climate change.},

Abstract = {A detailed spatio-temporal assessment of two basic climatic parameters
   (temperature and precipitation) is carried out using 22
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC
   AR4)-based atmospheric oceanic general circulation models (AOGCMs) over
   data-sparse and climatically vulnerable region of Pakistan (20
   degrees-37 degrees N and 60 degrees-78 degrees E), for the first time,
   for the baseline period (1975-1999), as well as for the three projected
   periods during the twenty-first century centered at 2025-2049,
   2050-2074, and 2075-2099, respectively, both on seasonal and on annual
   bases, under three Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES): A2, A1B,
   and B1. An ensemble-based approach consisting of the IPCC AR4-based
   AOGCMs indicates that during the winter season (from December to March),
   66\% of the models display robust projected increase of winter
   precipitation by about 10\% relative to the baseline period,
   irrespective of emission scenario and projection period, in the upper
   northern subregion of Pakistan (latitude >35 degrees N). The projected
   robust changes in the temperature by the end of twenty-first century are
   in the range of 3 to 4 degrees C during the winter season and on an
   annual basis, in the central and western regions of Punjab province,
   especially in A2 and A1B emission scenarios. In particular, the IPCC AR4
   models project a progressive increase in temperature throughout
   Pakistan, in contrast to spatial distribution of precipitation, where
   spatially less uniform and robust results for projected periods are
   obtained on sign of change. In general, changes in both precipitation
   and temperature are larger in the summer season (JAS) as compared to the
   winter season in the coming decades, relative to the baseline period.
   This may require comprehensive long-term strategic policies to adapt and
   mitigate climate change in Pakistan, in comparison to what is currently
   envisaged.},

   Towards a performance-based and wind-sensitive planning proposal in

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Performance-based planning (PBP) is designed to determine city planning
   standards based on local activity characteristics; however, there have
   been few practical applications of this method. This study applied PBP
   to assess the impact of urban building morphology on local climate
   surface temperatures under different wind conditions during 2017 in
   Shanghai, China using multi-source data, such as frontal area density
   (FAD), local climatic zone classification, land surface temperature
   (LST) data, and geographic information. The results showed that urban
   architectural patterns were one of the important drivers of climate
   change. High-density high-rise buildings can increase surface
   temperatures, which were evidenced in Local Climate Zone 4 (LCZ4), LCZ7,
   and LCZ8 in the city center. A correlation between building FAD and
   local climate surface temperature was 0.44 during the winter. Also, we
   found that although seasonal differences affected by wind direction were
   small, the same wind had different effects on the surface of urban
   buildings in different climate zones. These findings provide a reference
   for urban architecture planning and can help to develop urban heat
   island adaptation strategies based on local conditions.},

Abstract = {A demersal longline fishery for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus
   eleginoides) that commenced off the Prince Edward Islands during 1996
   has killed significant proportions of locally breeding albatrosses and
   petrels. As one of a suite of mitigation measures, we tested the
   efficacy of a Mustad underwater setting funnel to reduce incidental
   mortality of seabirds. The funnel, which deploys the longline 1-2 in
   beneath the sea surface, was used on 52\% of 1714 sets (total effort
   5.12 million hooks) over a 2-year period. Used in conjunction with a
   bird-scaring line, overall seabird bycatch rate was low (0.022 birds per
   1000 hooks), and was dominated by white-chinned petrels (Procellaria
   aequinoctialis) (88\% of the 114 birds killed). Bycatch rate was three
   times lower when the funnel was used both by day and at night. Daytime
   catch rates with the funnel were less than those attained during night
   sets without the funnel. In conjunction with other mitigation measures,
   underwater setting offers a significant reduction in seabird mortality
   in this fishery and could increase fishing efficiency by allowing
   daytime setting. However, small numbers of albatrosses were caught
   during daytime sets with the funnel, and its use for daytime sets should
   be closely monitored. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper presents amicrogrid (MG) proactive management framework to
   cope with adverse impacts of extreme windstorms. Upon receiving alerts
   for the forecasted windstorm, the framework finds a conservative
   schedule of MG with the minimum number of vulnerable branches in service
   while total load is served. The schedule ensures the MG normal operation
   prior to the windstorm while reducing the MG vulnerability at the event
   onset. The proposed method makes benefit of network reconfiguration,
   generation reschedule, conservation voltage regulation, optimal
   parameter settings of droop-controlled units, demand-side resources, and
   backup generation capacity. A vulnerability index is defined to assess
   the effectiveness of the proposed proactive management in reducing the
   MG vulnerability at the event onset. The proposed model is linearized
   that guarantees simplicity, robustness, and computational efficiency of
   the solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a
   real-scale MG against a windstorm.},

Abstract = {Increase of the urban ambient temperature caused by local and global
   phenomena is probably the more incontestable incident of climate change.
   Urban warming has a very significant impact on human life increasing the
   energy consumption, deteriorating the comfort levels, increasing the
   pollution concentration, threatening the human health and affecting the
   urban economy. Mitigation technologies aiming to countermeasure the
   impact of the phenomenon are rapidly developed and applied in real scale
   projects. The present paper aims to present in a critical and
   comprehensive way the recent scientific knowledge on the causes of urban
   warming and also stress the main problems and inconsistencies concerning
   the experimental and the theoretical findings and analysis. In parallel,
   it classifies and summarizes the main knowledge on the energy,
   environmental, health and economic impacts of urban warming.
   Quantitative information on the energy penalties, mortality rates and
   environmental degradation induced by urban warming is presented.
   Finally, it presents the main developments regarding urban mitigation
   techniques and technologies and in particular, urban greenery and
   planted roofs, cool pavements, cool roofs and increase of the urban
   albedo, decrease of the anthropogenic heat and use of the ground as a
   sink for heat dissipation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   increasingly important to identify how threatened communities adapt to
   livelihood stressors. We investigate how adaptation is negotiated in two
   coastal fishing communities by documenting livelihood stressors,
   household assets, adaptive strategies, and factors that facilitate or
   inhibit adaptation. Declining catch is the most common stressor being
   experienced in both communities, however, socioeconomic, e. g., disease
   or theft, and ecological, e. g., severe storms and drought, changes are
   also creating livelihood stress. We find that specialized fishers' with
   higher investment in fishing gear and government support are adapting by
   intensifying their fishing efforts, whereas poorer fishers with more
   livelihood options are adapting through diversification. Adaptation is
   facilitated by fishers' groups, occupational pride, and family networks.
   It is inhibited by limited assets, competition over declining resources,
   and pervasive poverty. Our data suggest that adaptation is a
   heterogeneous process that is influenced by multiple factors.
   Understanding the complexity of fishers' responses to livelihood
   stressors is critical for fostering adaptive capacity in coastal
   communities, for strengthening fisheries management, and for improving
   the livelihoods of fishing dependent communities.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {There is an assumption that land use planning policies are a central
   enabler of coastal climate change adaptation in vulnerable localities.
   Such assumptions presume benefits in balancing competing interests in
   coastlines. In developed societies, these interests can be usefully
   categorised as public interest benefits and private property rights.
   While balanced competing interests is a nice idea, this article explores
   why complex political and geolegal realities in vulnerable coastal
   localities make this balance difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in
   reality. Using a legal geography lens, I critically examine how local
   governments use law and land use policy to respond to climate change
   adaptation in three coastal localities in New South Wales, Australia. I
   also explore how relations between key coastal actors and dynamic

Title = {Evolution of marine storminess in the Belgian part of the North Sea},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {305-312},
Abstract = {Severe storms have affected European coast lines in the past but
   knowledge on changes in storminess for the last decades is still sparse.
   Climate change is assumed to be a main driving factor with the potential
   to induce changes on the intensity, duration and frequency of powerful
   marine storms, including a long-term influence on peak wind speeds,
   surges and waves. It is, therefore, important to investigate whether in
   the last decades changes in the magnitude of storms, their duration and
   frequency could be observed. Understanding trends in storminess in the
   last decades will help to better prepare coastal managers for future
   events, taking into account potential changes on storm occurrence and
   magnitude to improve planning of mitigation and adaptation strategies.
   The purpose of this study was to focus on the evolution of extreme wind
   conditions, wave height and storm surge levels in the North Sea Region,
   especially in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS). Based on the
   analysis performed it is concluded that no clear trend can be observed
   for the occurrence of significant increasing extreme wind speeds over
   the BPNS. Furthermore, one can conclude that not enough scientific
   evidence is available to support scenarios with increased wave height or
   storminess.},

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to bring about lower water levels and reduced
   depths in the Great Lakes, with consequent reductions in vessel cargo
   capacities and increases in shipping costs. Under the most severe
   conditions annual transportation costs for Great Lakes - St. Lawrence
   River commercial navigation could increase by 29 percent,- more moderate
   climate change could result in a 13 percent increase, based on current
   prices. The impacts vary between commodities and routes. Cost increases
   of this magnitude suggest that adaptation measures may be worthwhile.
   The most obvious form of adaptation, and likely the least expensive, is
   deepening or increasing water depths at harbours and other shallow water
   points. Depth improvements should be carried out where benefits are
   highest. A small number of ports and shallow water points are
   responsible for most of the cost increases. A method of determining the
   most beneficial depth improvements is proposed.},

Abstract = {Purpose of Review Subtropical highs are an important component of the
   climate system with clear implications on the local climate regimes of
   the subtropical regions. In a climate change perspective, understanding
   and predicting subtropical highs and related climate is crucial to local
   societies for climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. We review
   the current understanding of the subtropical highs in the framework of
   climate change.
   Recent Findings Projected changes of subtropical highs are not uniform.
   Intensification, weakening, and shifts may largely differ in the two
   hemispheres but may also change across different ocean basins. For some
   regions, large inter-model spread representation of subtropical highs
   and related dynamics is largely responsible for the uncertainties in the
   projections. The understanding and evaluation of the projected changes
   may also depend on the metrics considered and may require investigations
   separating thermodynamical and dynamical processes.
   Summary The dynamics of subtropical highs has a well-established
   theoretical background but the understanding of its variability and
   change is still affected by large uncertainties. Climate model
   systematic errors, low-frequency chaotic variability, coupled
   ocean-atmosphere processes, and sensitivity to climate forcing are all
   sources of uncertainty that reduce the confidence in atmospheric
   circulation aspects of climate change, including the subtropical highs.
   Compensating signals, coming from a tug-of-war between components
   associated with direct carbon dioxide radiative forcing and indirect sea
   surface temperature warming, impose limits that must be considered.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine experiences from Eastern Canada to
   summarize and present information which may help operators, planners,
   researchers, and policy-makers in the marine transportation sector
   identify potential short-term and long-term strategies for improving
   services and making more effective decisions regarding ways to minimize
   the impact of ice-related disruptions to ferry service in ice prone
   regions of the world. In this study, emphasis has been placed on
   examining the impacts of ice-related disruptions in ferry service on
   public stakeholders, since this end-user perspective provides important
   insights into consequences and associated mitigation strategies. The
   methodology employed includes a high-level examination of regional ferry
   services, followed by an identification and selection of specific
   routes, completion of a survey of publically reported disruption events
   for these routes and compiling information about reported stakeholder
   consequences associated with ice-related disruptions. Three
   representative ferry routes have been considered to assess issues
   relating to resilience in urban versus rural regions, the availability
   of alternatives and changes with time, as well as potential strategies
   that may be taken to help address the most pressing issues are
   discussed. The main impacts most frequently reported as consequences of
   ice-related disruptions for these routes are: (1) Reduced access to
   medical care; (2) Decreased food security; (3) Disruptions for workers
   and commercial transport; and (4) Inconvenience, frustration and cost to
   travelers. Most commonly identified preventative strategies for
   addressing these issues include: (1) New ferries with increased ice
   capabilities; (2) Increased icebreaker support and ice forecasting
   capabilities; (3) Infrastructure upgrades, including consideration of
   alternative ports; and (4) Use of alternative modes of transport (e.g.
   alternate routes, airplanes, or fixed links). Identified mitigation
   strategies for reducing the impact of these disruptions include: (1)
   Increased communication services; (2) Government programs to improve
   community preparedness and resilience; and (3) Government programs (e.g.
   subsidies) to assist those affected by disruptions. (C) 2017 The

Title = {Carbon Stocks of Tropical Coastal Wetlands within the Karstic Landscape
   of the Mexican Caribbean},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands can have exceptionally large carbon (C) stocks and
   their protection and restoration would constitute an effective
   mitigation strategy to climate change. Inclusion of coastal ecosystems
   in mitigation strategies requires quantification of carbon stocks in
   order to calculate emissions or sequestration through time. In this
   study, we quantified the ecosystem C stocks of coastal wetlands of the
   Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We
   stratified the SKBR into different vegetation types (tall, medium and
   dwarf mangroves, and marshes), and examined relationships of
   environmental variables with C stocks. At nine sites within SKBR, we
   quantified ecosystem C stocks through measurement of above and
   belowground biomass, downed wood, and soil C. Additionally, we measured
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the soil and interstitial salinity.
   Tall mangroves had the highest C stocks (987 +/- 338 Mg ha(-1)) followed
   by medium mangroves (623 +/- 41 Mg ha(-1)), dwarf mangroves (381 +/- 52
   Mg ha(-1)) and marshes (177 +/- 73 Mg ha(-1)). At all sites, soil C
   comprised the majority of the ecosystem C stocks (78-99\%). Highest C
   stocks were measured in soils that were relatively low in salinity, high
   in P and low in N: P, suggesting that P limits C sequestration and
   accumulation potential. In this karstic area, coastal wetlands,
   especially mangroves, are important C stocks. At the landscape scale,
   the coastal wetlands of Sian Ka'an covering approximate to 172,176 ha
   may store 43.2 to 58.0 million Mg of C.},

Abstract = {Plant communities of the Mediterranean climate Regions are exposed to
   high temperatures, high radiation and water stress during summer, they
   are dominated by evergreen sclerophyllous species and drought semi
   deciduous species. To define the adaptive strategies, anatomical and
   morphological leaf traits of Quercus ilex L., Phillyrea latifolia L.
   (typical evergreen sclerophyllous species) and Cistus incanus L., (a
   drought semi deciduous species), growing in the Mediterranean maquis
   along Pome's coast line (Italy) were analysed. The typical evergreen
   sclerophyllous species have long leaf life span (from 1 to 4 years),
   steeper leaf inclination (average 56 degrees), higher specific leaf mass
   (average 21.3 mg cm(-2)) and the highest leaf thickness (average 324
   mum). The semi deciduous species have a lower leaf life span (from 4 to
   8 months), a lower leaf inclination (44 degrees +/- 13 degrees), a lower
   specific leaf mass (14.7 +/-1.5 mg cm(-2)) and a lower leaf thickness
   (244 +/- 15 mum). The more xeromorphyc species (Q. ilex and P.
   latifolia) may be at a competitive advantage considering the forecasted
   air temperature increase in the Mediterranean basin. Increasing drought
   stress may in fact determine a shortening of leaf life span that may
   prove to be critical for C. incanus. Knowledge of plant response to
   stress factors is important in the perspective of climatic changes.},

Title = {Local Expert Perceptions of Migration as a Climate Change Adaptation in
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {People have long migrated for many reasons, often with a combination of
   forced and voluntary reasons combining to push them away from current
   situations and to pull them towards new situations. Bangladesh is one
   example where environmental changes have long been amongst the multitude
   of reasons for migrating, with contemporary climate change suggested as
   a major impetus towards more migration. This paper examines local expert
   perceptions of migration as a climate change adaptation strategy for
   Bangladeshis. Seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted with local
   experts in Bangladesh and Assam (India) on environmental change and
   migration to understand the perspectives of those with formal education
   and expert-related jobs who come from the areas being directly affected
   by Bangladeshi migration. Findings show that local experts consider that
   migration is used and will be used for climate change adaptation in
   Bangladesh, but migration is not solely for climate change adaptation,
   instead interweaving with all other factors influencing
   migration-related decisions.},

   Fishing Communities in the South Brazil Bight},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Understanding the social vulnerabilities and community strategies to
   adapt to environmental changes are crucial for the development of
   actions to enhance both community conservation and survival. With the
   aim to identify the drivers of vulnerability to climate change among
   different coastal communities a comprehensive multiscale vulnerability
   framework was here adopted. Eight selected fishing communities
   representative of the South Brazil Bight (SBB) area were surveyed at the
   household level. A total of 151 fishers were interviewed. Quantitative
   indicators were calculated at the community-level, and their drivers
   identified, allowing for comparisons of the overall vulnerability score.
   Findings revealed that remoteness and the lack of climate change-related
   institutional support increase vulnerability among fishing communities
   in the region. On the other hand, community organization, leadership,
   research partnerships, community-based co-management, and livelihood
   diversification reduce vulnerability. Our analysis focused on social
   vulnerability to climate change in regional fishing communities and
   provides a better understanding of these effects in coastal zones, the
   factors explaining vulnerability and some perspectives on resilient and
   adaptable systems. Learning from comparisons at the ecosystem level may
   be applied to coastal regions elsewhere.},

Abstract = {With the closure of the Dutch estuary ``South Sea{''} in 1932, a large
   artificial lake was created of which the water level is controlled by
   discharge sluices. Due to a gradually rising sea level, the discharge
   capacity of these facilities has decreased and the control of the lake
   levels is insufficient. Future projections of sea level rise and
   rainfall patterns are highly uncertain, coupled to the uncertainties of
   climate change. Options for expanding discharge capacity were studied,
   using lifecycle costing. It could be shown that adaptive solutions are
   the most robust in view of the uncertain projections of the future.
   Lifecycle costing in the presented form turned out to be a suitable way
   of supporting public decision-making on large infrastructure.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {976-984},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Today, many older coastal, riverine, and deltaic communities are faced
   with increasing flood risk, often combined with a rise in sea levels or
   land erosion. Until now, the options available to owners of heritage
   properties have been limited. Buoyant foundation retrofits offer
   under-resourced communities a viable and affordable adaptation
   alternative to buy-outs, tear-downs, and ``displacement by climate
   change{''}. Amphibious strategies will not solve all challenges related
   to the increased impacts of climate change on heritage architecture, but
   offer a resilient option for communities to protect their physical
   history and cultural identity. This paper will provide an overview of
   amphibious retrofit construction and its application to the preservation
   of historic buildings and neighborhoods. It will provide several case
   study examples, namely, retrofits of heritage buildings in the
   historically significant African-American community of Princeville,
   North Carolina; for a low-income neighborhood of freedman's cottages in
   Charleston, South Carolina; and a creative approach for amphibiating
   architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's iconic Farnsworth House in Plano,
   Illinois. It will connect to larger themes of developing innovative and
   practical methods for providing flood protection to heritage structures,
   using an approach that emphasizes sensitivity and adaptability to the
   cultural values of existing communities.},

Title = {Mapping evapotranspirative and radiative cooling services in an urban
   environment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {85},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As impervious surfaces have seized most areas in cities worldwide, urban
   heat island (UHI) has become a global concern. Urban green
   infrastructures (UGI) are crucial to providing microclimate regulation
   and thermal comfort through evapotranspiration (ET) and shading.
   High-spatiotemporal-resolution ET maps are required to plan and manage
   UGI to mitigate the UHI and droughts. We propose a method using
   open-access data, including hourly meteorological data and remote
   sensing vegetation parameters, to predict heat fluxes using a
   soil-vegetationatmosphere model. The ET prediction accuracy was assessed
   using eddy covariance towers, showing an R2 of 0.84 for the
   residential-vegetated site and 0.57 for the built-up site during 2019. A
   greening cooling service index (GCoS), divided into evapotranspirative
   (ECoS) and radiative (RCoS) cooling effects were mapped for Berlin,
   Germany. Almost half of the population and 21\% of the city area are
   located in low GCoS (<0.25). Based upon climate change scenarios, a rise
   in temperature increases the annual ET, while plant stress and droughts
   considerably decrease overall cooling services. Simulation of
   climatological scenarios and plant traits can help to define more
   suitable species adapted for urban environments. The presented method
   provides an effective decision-making tool for urban planning to reduce
   heat risk for urban residents.},

Title = {Evaluation of the impact of the urban heat island on residential and

Abstract = {This study evaluated the impact of the urban heat island (UHI) in the
   Tokyo metropolitan area on energy consumption in the residential and
   commercial sectors. Although there are many indications that UHIs
   increase energy consumption by air conditioners, the possible decrease
   in consumption of heating energy in winter is usually ignored. To
   quantify the net impact of a UHI, it is crucial to consider both
   factors. Furthermore, it is important to consider the spatial
   distribution because a UHI represents the local temperature change in an
   urban area, and the spatial distribution of energy consumption in an
   urban area is complicated. We developed a new method to evaluate UHI
   impact by taking into consideration the spatial and temporal
   distributions of both energy consumption and air temperature. The
   results reveal that the UHI increases commercial energy consumption in
   the Tokyo metropolitan area but decreases residential energy
   consumption; however, there is a total net decrease in energy
   consumption. This suggests that UHI mitigation measures should
   particularly target the city center, where commercial buildings are
   concentrated, whereas in residential areas, sufficient assessments must
   be conducted to ensure that mitigation measures are introduced with
   caution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a Coastal Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) of a
   microtidal beach located on the Ionian Sea in Calabria region (southern
   Italy) in order to examine the influence of the different run-up
   equations on CVA score and propose mitigation measures for the most
   vulnerable parts of the beach. The coastal area has been severely eroded
   by extreme wave storms, which have also damaged important archaeological
   structures located on a nearby cliff. A typical 1 year return period
   (T-r) storm, associated with the recent criticalities, was chosen to
   test the different run-up formulas (Holman (1986), Mase (1989) Stockdon
   et al. (2006) and Poate et al. (2016)) on a number of beach profiles in
   order to check the sensitivity of the CVA calculation with regard to the
   different run-up equations. The obtained results provide evidence that
   different run-up levels often give rise to different CVA scores. Based
   on vulnerability results, some mitigation measures have been proposed
   for the beach in front of the archaeological area, based on submerged
   detached breakwater and an adherent gabion wall for the cliff defence.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the efficacy of community-based climate change
   adaptation (CBA) for adequately addressing shoreline change. This
   knowledge is especially urgent in developing countries where shoreline
   change is very likely to inflict economic burdens on coastal
   communities. Here, we review a CBA shoreline remediation project in
   Brebes Regency, Indonesia using a mixed method approach (shoreline
   change analysis, field visits with semi-structured interviews, and
   participatory community meetings). The findings reveal that the CBA
   dependent on reactive adaptation measures did not adequately control
   coastal erosion. Limited coordination between government agencies and
   the Brebes CBA practitioners, and a poor understanding of the physical
   processes occurring along the coast, were major barriers to the success
   of CBA actions. The CBA actions, in fact, exposed the areas to
   subsequent erosion, making the effort to manage the shoreline change
   unnecessary and costly. The CBA actions cannot be effective until
   coordination among the relevant stakeholders, and knowledge of coastal
   processes, both improve.},

Title = {The Role of Living Shorelines as Estuarine Habitat Conservation
   Strategies},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {161-174},
Abstract = {Globally, shoreline protection approaches are evolving towards the
   incorporation of natural and nature-based features (living shorelines
   henceforth) as a preferred alternative to shoreline armoring. Emerging
   research suggests that living shorelines may be a viable approach to
   conserving coastal habitats (marshes, beaches, shallows, seagrasses)
   along eroding shorelines. Living shorelines typically involve the use of
   coastal habitats, such as wetlands, that have a natural capacity to
   stabilize the shore, restore or conserve habitat, and maintain coastal
   processes. They provide stability while still being dynamic components
   of the ecosystem, but due to their dynamic nature, careful designs and
   some maintenance will be required if habitat conservation is a goal.
   Living shorelines may represent a singular opportunity for habitat
   conservation in urban and developing estuaries because of their value to
   society as a shoreline protection approach and resilience to sea level
   rise. However, enhanced public acceptance and coordination among
   regulatory and advisory authorities will be essential to expand their
   use. To fully understand their significance as habitat conservation
   strategies, systematic and standardized monitoring at both regional and
   national scales is vital to evaluate the evolution, persistence, and
   maximum achievable functionality (e.g., ecosystem service provision) of
   living shoreline habitats.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Coastal flooding poses serious threats to coastal areas, and the
   vulnerability of coastal communities and economic sectors to flooding
   will increase in the coming decades due to environmental and
   socioeconomic changes. It is increasingly recognised that estimates of
   the vulnerability of cities are essential for planning adaptation
   measures. Jakarta is a case in point, since parts of the city are
   subjected to regular flooding on a near-monthly basis. In order to
   assess the current and future coastal flood hazard, we set up a
   GIS-based flood model of northern Jakarta to simulate inundated area and
   value of exposed assets. Under current conditions, estimated damage
   exposure to extreme coastal flood events with return periods of 100 and
   1,000 years is high ((sic)4.0 and (sic)5.2 billion, respectively). Under
   the scenario for 2100, damage exposure associated with these events
   increases by a factor 4-5, with little difference between low/high
   sea-level rise scenarios. This increase is mainly due to rapid land
   subsidence and excludes socioeconomic developments. We also develop a
   detemporalised inundation scenario for assessing impacts associated with
   any coastal flood scenario. This allows for the identification of
   critical points above which large increases in damage exposure can be
   expected and also for the assessment of adaptation options against
   hypothetical user-defined levels of change, rather than being bound to a
   discrete set of a priori scenarios. The study highlights the need for
   urgent attention to the land subsidence problem; a continuation of the
   current rate would result in catastrophic increases in damage exposure.},

Abstract = {For microorganisms, heat shock is a major stressful condition. Heat
   shock is characterized by sudden temperature increases that damage
   important protein structures and interfere with essential cellular
   functions. In this study, global gene expression patterns of the
   deep-sea bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 in response to heat
   shock were studied by DNA microarray analysis. Overall, 438, 573, and
   627 genes were found to be differentially expressed after heat shock for
   30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. Functional classification of
   differentially transcribed genes was performed using the Clusters of
   Orthologous Groups of Proteins database. Additionally, 361 genes were
   identified as common differentially expressed genes. These genes may
   comprise the core genes responsible for coping with heat shock stress of
   WP3. Moreover, comparative analysis of gene expression pattern in WP3
   and other bacteria indicated the presence of different adaptive
   strategies. These data represent the first transcriptome resource for
   the response of this deep-sea bacterium to high-temperature stress. This
   study contributes to the understanding of the global adaptation
   mechanisms of benthic bacteria toward environmental stresses. (C) 2016

Title = {On Mitigating the Effects of Multipath on GNSS Using Environmental
   Context Detection},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Accurate, ubiquitous and reliable navigation can make transportation
   systems (road, rail, air and marine) more efficient, safer and more
   sustainable by enabling path planning, route optimization and fuel
   economy optimization. However, accurate navigation in urban contexts has
   always been a challenging task due to significant chances of signal
   blockage and multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal reception.
   This paper presents a detailed study on environmental context detection
   using GNSS signals and its utilization in mitigating multipath effects
   by devising a context-aware navigation (CAN) algorithm that detects and
   characterizes the working environment of a GNSS receiver and applies the
   desired mitigation strategy accordingly. The CAN algorithm utilizes GNSS
   measurement variables to categorize the environment into standard,
   degraded and highly degraded classes and then updates the receiver's
   tracking-loop parameters based on the inferred environment. This allows
   the receiver to adaptively mitigate the effects of multipath/NLOS, which
   inherently depend upon the type of environment. To validate the
   functionality and potential of the proposed CAN algorithm, a detailed
   study on the performance of a multi-GNSS receiver in the
   quad-constellation mode, i.e., GPS, BeiDou, Galileo and GLONASS, is
   conducted in this research by traversing an instrumented vehicle around
   an urban city and acquiring respective GNSS signals in different
   environments. The performance of a CAN-enabled GNSS receiver is compared
   with a standard receiver using fundamental quality indicators of GNSS.
   The experimental results show that the proposed CAN algorithm is a good
   contributor for improving GNSS performance by anticipating the potential
   degradation and initiating an adaptive mitigation strategy. The
   CAN-enabled GNSS receiver achieved a lane-level accuracy of less than 2
   m for 53\% of the total experimental time-slot in a highly degraded
   environment, which was previously only 32\% when not using the proposed
   CAN.},

Title = {Facing the heat: A systematic literature review exploring the
   transferability of solutions to cope with urban heat waves},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {714-727},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urban heat waves are an increasing phenomenon around the world. Over the
   last decade the combination of climate change and the urban heat island
   effect have resulted in rising temperatures in cities. The related heat
   stress has severe impact on urban populations and infrastructure.
   However, it is unclear to what extent solutions to urban heat waves
   depend on context or if similarities can be identified that would
   support their adoption to different urban settings. The purpose of this
   study is to gain a better overview of solution characteristics and
   ultimately of their transferability. Based on a systematic qualitative
   and quantitative literature review we analysed solutions to urban heat
   waves with regard to geographical distribution, specific characteristics
   and pivotal actors. Results show that the sampled case studies
   concentrated on North America, Europe and Australia. The analysed
   solutions focus mostly on the use of green and blue infrastructure or
   grey infrastructure. Our review highlights city administration as
   pivotal actor for implementing solutions and emphasizes the importance
   of inhabitants as well as local governments as essential actors for
   adaptation to urban heat waves. We conclude by formulating
   recommendations to increase transferability of solutions to urban heat
   waves.},

Title = {A rapid fine-scale approach to modelling urban bioclimatic conditions},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {756},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Surface characteristics play a vital role in simulations for urban
   bioclimatic conditions. Changing relationships and distribution patterns
   of sealed and vegetated surfaces as well as building geometry across
   different scales in urban environments influence surface temperatures.
   Cities comprise different urban forms, which, depending on their surface
   characteristics, enhance the heating process, increasing the emergence
   of urban heat islands (UHIs). Detecting priority areas to introduce
   multi-beneficial climate change adaptation measures is set to be a key
   task for the cities long-term strategies to improve climatic conditions
   across different urban structures and scales. We introduce a simple and
   fast spatial modelling approach to carry out fine-scale simulations for
   land surface temperature (LST), mean radiant temperature (MRT) and
   Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in a 2D environment. Capabilities
   of our modelling approach are demonstrated in evaluating urban thermal
   comfort in the alpine city of Innsbruck, the capital of Tyrol in western
   Austria. Results show a major contrast between sealed and vegetated
   surfaces reflected in the distributional patterns and values of LST, MRT
   and UM, correlating with the appearance and frequency of specific
   surface classes. We found the Sky View Factor to have a substantial
   impact on calculations for bioclimatic conditions and see high-albedo
   surfaces decrease LST but increase the apparent temperature (MRT and
   UTCI values) effecting human thermal comfort. Furthermore, MRT and UTCI
   are more sensitive to changes in emissivity values, whereas LST is more
   sensitive to changes in Bowen Ratio values. Application of our modelling
   approach can be used to identify priority areas and maximise
   multi-functionality of dimate change adaptation measures, to support
   urban planning processes for heat mitigation and the implementation of
   policy suggestions to achieve sustainable development goals and other
   political objectives. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Coastal Structures as Beach Erosion Control and Sea Level Rise
   Adaptation in Malaysia: A Review},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The shoreline of Malaysia is exposed to threats of coastal erosion and a
   rise of sea level. The National Coastal Erosion Study, 2015 reported
   that 15\% of an 8840 km shoreline is currently eroding, where one-third
   of those falls under the critical and significant categories that
   require structural protection. The Study of Sea Level Rise in Malaysia,
   2017 presented a sea-level increase of 0.67-0.74 mm on average yearly.
   This study reviewed selected coastal protection structures along the
   shoreline of Malaysia as an erosion control and sea-level rise
   adaptation based on coastal management strategies. Hard structures such
   as rock revetment and breakwater are commonly used as erosion protection
   systems in the ``hold the line{''} strategy. Increased platform level of
   seawalls and earth bunds, considered as an ``adaptation{''} approach,
   are effective in erosion protection and are adaptive to sea-level rise.
   Mangrove replanting is suitable as a ``limited intervention{''} approach
   in minimizing the long-term impact of both threats. However, offshore
   breakwater, groyne, and geotextile tubes are solely for protection
   purposes and are not as effective for sea-level rise adaptation. As the
   sea level is continuously increasing, their function as coastal
   protection will also become less effective. In summary, this
   comprehensive review on coastal protection in Malaysia will benefit the
   related agencies on the future assessment.},

Abstract = {Aim Forest herbs might be unable to track shifts in habitat suitability
   due to rapid climate change and habitat fragmentation. In this study, we
   quantified the role of dispersal limitation and the potential mitigating
   effect of large-scale reforestation on the redistribution of the
   herbaceous forest plant species Primula elatior under climate change.
   Location Europe. Methods High resolution (100 m) landscape-scale and
   macro-climatic variables were combined to predict range-wide habitat
   suitability using Maxent. Dispersal limitation was modelled, based on
   isolation-by-resistance (IBR) principles through integration of circuit
   theory and genomic data, to assess patch accessibility and
   metapopulation stability under climate change. Large-scale reforestation
   was evaluated as a potential mitigating strategy by incorporating a land
   use change scenario into the distribution and dispersal models. Results
   Landscape-scale variables contributed significantly to the distribution
   of P. elatior (78.33\%) and to the accuracy of our model (AUC = 0.81).
   Isolation-by-resistance (R-cond(2) = .92) was driven by land use
   (45.5\%), distance from rivers (36.4\%) and elevation (18.2\%). It was
   estimated that 46.4 +/- 13.9\% (mean +/- SD of climate change scenarios)
   of the total distribution area would be lost due to climate change by
   2050 and an additional 15.6 +/- 1.7\% (mean +/- SD) of the distribution
   would not be accessible through migration. The median latitude of the
   patch distribution shifted 183.2 +/- 34.8 km (mean +/- SD) northwards
   and 58.1 +/- 9.3 km (mean +/- SD) to more maritime regions. The patch
   accessibility was low in these regions and the metapopulation stability
   decreased considerably in the south of the distribution. Reforestation
   mitigated 54.1 +/- 18.2\% (mean +/- SD) of the accessible distribution
   area loss and 49.5 +/- 4.2\% (mean +/- SD) of the decrease in
   metapopulation stability. Main conclusion To alleviate the loss of the
   accessible distribution area of P. elatior under climate change, it will
   be required to integrate climate mitigation strategies (RCP 2.6),
   range-wide afforestation, restoration of ecological connectivity and
   focused assisted migration to newly available habitat.},

Abstract = {In the current scenario of massive urbanization and global climate
   change, an intelligent monitoring of the environmental variables is
   becoming fundamental to ensure good living conditions in cities. Indeed,
   the acquisition of data with high spatiotemporal resolution can enable
   the assessment of environmental vulnerabilities in urban areas towards
   the definition of responsive adaptation and mitigation strategies. In
   this context, the current work presents a two-fold approach based on
   low-cost cloud-connected sensors for (i) fixed and (ii) mobile
   monitoring of several environmental parameters. This paper, which
   focuses on the measurement aspects of the urban micro-climate, describes
   in detail the hardware and software components of both approaches, and
   how to exploit them for setting up a field campaign. The methods were
   tested in the city of Bolzano (Italy), demonstrating their suitability
   for identifying the spatial variability of the microclimate in relation
   to the urban morphology, and for highlighting the presence of the urban
   heat island and estimating its intensity.},

Abstract = {Risk-management solutions that increase opportunities for adaptation
   plans and resilience to climate change require an understanding of
   climate change processes and the trickle down effects of droughts and
   floods on hydrological and socio-economic systems. To guide future
   expectations about droughts, this study aims to assess large-scale
   variability of hydrological stores (groundwater, soil moisture, and
   surface water) and their responses to drought intensities over large
   semi-arid domains in Australia. Multi-scaled indicators synthesised from
   in-situ rainfall (SPI-standardised precipitation index), water budget
   (SPEI-standardised evapotranspiration precipitation index), model (soil
   moisture-SM), and satellite observations (groundwater storage-GWS,
   surface water extent-SWE, and terrestrial water storage-TWS) are
   employed to assess this variability in climatic hotspots identified
   through statistical rotation. The link between these hotspots and
   climate modes are diagnosed using gaussian kernel-based SVMR (support
   vector machine regression), and quantile function of storage (QFS) is
   used to assess the response of hydrological stores to climate
   variability. The capability of these indicators to capture impacts of
   water deficit on agricultural systems is explored by implementing a PLSR
   (partial least square regression). Results show that (i) drought
   characteristics and intensities vary greatly across Australia but
   hotspots of higher drought duration and intensity are predominant in
   regions below latitude 25 degrees S, (ii) hydrological drought
   indicators (SPEI/SPI-12) are better predictors of hydrological stores
   such as TWS and GWS, though the latter shows strong but opposite phase
   relationship with climate data, (iii) influence of climate
   teleconnections is better diagnosed and predicted with SPEI/SPI-12, and
   the Murray Darling basin-MDB (r = 0.84, alpha = 0.05) and central/east
   coast (r = 0.80, 0.79, alpha = 0.05) are major teleconnection hotspots,
   (iv) SM and GWS losses in the MDB occurred 60\% and about 44\% of the
   time, respectively, during the 2002 2017 period, (v) extreme events
   (droughts and floods) affect the distribution of SWE, and (vi)
   meteorological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-3) are excellent metrics
   that capture variability in crop production. Choosing appropriate
   indicators that reflect the response of freshwater ecosystems (including
   groundwater) to climatic and anthropogenic constraints is part of a key
   process to guide investments in drought resilience and sustainable
   management of water resources.},

Abstract = {Jordan has recently given distinguished attention to its single and
   extremely limited sea outlet - Aqaba. An innovative governing system is
   being established. Aqaba has been declared as a Special Economic Zone
   Authority. The main objectives of the new authority are to develop Aqaba
   as a haven for commerce, a destination for tourism, and an incubator for
   technology. A strong limiting factor to this ambitious planning is the
   scarcity of fresh water. The conventional water resources utilized to
   satisfy the increasing water demand will reach the maximum sustainable
   yield in less than 5 years. At present, water supply is abstracted from
   groundwater aquifers and amounts to about 16.4 million m(3)/y (MCM/y).
   According to the final master plan of the ASEZA, the total consumption
   is expected to increase by about 5 MCM/y in the first 5 years, 11 MCM/ y
   in the following 5 years, and about 30 MCM/y by the end of 20 years. The
   ultimate allocation for ASEZA from the conventional water recourses from
   the Disi non-renewable aquifer does not exceed 17.5 MCM/y. This
   identified gap in water supply has definitely to be filled by
   unconventional water resources such as desalination of seawater and
   brackish water. The location of ASEZ alongside the Red Sea and over
   partly brackish aquifers does qualify it for desalination. However, the
   ASEZA Environmental Commission is currently identifying significant
   issues to be considered in the mitigation measures when designing
   desalination plants in order to alleviate adverse environmental impacts
   to the ecosystem. This paper discusses the expected future water
   demands, the ASEZA acceptable water standards for the different water
   uses, and the environmental impact of the desalination plants and their
   respective mitigation measures.},

Title = {Towards a typology for coastal towns and small cities for climate change
   adaptation planning},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change will manifest differently in urban areas
   depending upon the individual characteristics and contexts of each
   settlement. The study of climate adaptation planning for towns and small
   cities is a relatively under-researched field, there has thus far not
   been a standard typology for characterising towns and cities located at
   the coast. A typology can inform stakeholders about the physical hazards
   a coastal town or small city may be exposed currently and in the future;
   identify the impact that may have to the local population and the
   economic, cultural, and environmental assets in the settlement; and
   identify any barriers or opportunities to plan, develop, and implement
   adaptation strategies. A typology is presented here that includes 34
   parameters that cover physical, economic, environmental and social
   characteristics. This typology has been used within this Special Issue
   to obtain information about all 22 case studies of the Special Issue.
   Future work will concentrate on developing the typology further and
   analysing the data collected to provide a systematic understanding of
   some of the data gaps that still exist within the field of adaptation in
   coastal towns and small cities and allow future research to focus on the
   aspects that are most needed.},

Abstract = {The natural disasters deriving from climate change have a growing impact
   in urban contexts and mainly affect the poorest people. Adaptation to
   climate change can significantly reduce the impacts if planned. The aim
   of this chapter is to present the state of adaptation planning,
   illustrating three international projects that promote it (Climate
   change initiative, Cancun adaptation framework, Hyogo framework of
   action) and 14 adaptation pilot projects for coastal cities. The latter
   are plans, strategies and guidelines produced over the past 5 years for
   coastal cities from different continents. These case studies are
   analysed and compared, paying attention to six key aspects: type of
   tool, aims, identification of the impacts deriving from climate change,
   time schedule and budget, role of the stakeholders in the planning
   process, identification of specific measures. It emerges that important
   steps have been taken in the adaptation to climate change, but there is
   still a long way to go before having valid adaptation planning tools.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Urban flooding in developing countries of the Global South is growing
   due to extreme rainfall and sea-level rise induced by climate change, as
   well as the proliferation of impervious, built-up areas resulting from
   unplanned urbanisation and development. Continuous loss of traditional
   knowledge related to local water management practices, and the
   de-valuing of such knowledge that goes hand-in-hand with globalised
   aspirations, is inhibiting flood resilience efforts. This paper aims to
   address the need to include traditional water knowledge (TWK) in urban
   living and development processes in the Global South.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper commences with a review of existing frameworks that focus on
   natural resource management, critically assessing two existing
   frameworks of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). The assessment of
   the existing approaches contributes to this paper's development of a
   novel framework to promote TWK with regard to resilience and risk
   reduction, specifically for developing flood adaptive strategies, which
   is the second stage of this paper. Finally, the paper explains how the
   framework can contribute to the field of urban design and planning using
   examples from the literature to demonstrate challenges and opportunities
   related to the adaptation of such a framework.
   Findings
   The framework developed in this paper reveals three proposed vertices of
   TWK, named as place-based landscape knowledge, water use and management
   and water values. This framework has the potential to produce
   context-specific knowledge that can contribute to flood-resilient
   built-environment through urban design and practices.

   Originality/value
   Within the field of TEK research, very few researchers have explored the
   field of developing flood resilience in an urban context. The proposed
   TWK framework presented in this paper will help to fill that gap.},

Title = {Firm relocation as adaptive response to climate change and weather

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Growing scientific evidence suggests that human-induced climate change
   will bring about large-scale environmental changes such as sea-level
   rise and coastal flooding, extreme weather events and agricultural
   disruptions. The speed and extent of these changes and the expected
   impacts on social and corresponding economic and industrial systems are
   now moving to the forefront of debates. In this paper, we argue that
   climate change will lead to significant disruptions to firms which might
   ultimately create the necessity of a geographical shift of firm and
   industrial activities away from regions highly affected by climate
   change. Such a shift might become necessary due to (1) direct
   disruptions through climate change impacts on firm operations, for
   instance through droughts, floods, or sea level rise, and due to (2)
   disruptions in a firm's supplier, buyer or resource base that lead to
   flow-on effects and adverse consequences for a firm. We propose a
   framework for integrating firm relocation decisions into firm adaptive
   responses to climate change. The framework consists of three assessment
   steps: the level of risk from climate change impacts at a firm's
   location, the feasibility of relocation, and associated costs and
   benefits. We apply the framework to two case examples. The first case of
   electricity distribution firms in Victoria/Australia illustrates how the
   relocation (undergrounding) of cables could decrease the vulnerability
   of distribution networks to bushfires and the risk of electricity-caused
   fires, but would require significant investments. The second case of
   firms in the Australian pastoral industry points to geographic
   diversification of pastoral land holdings as possible adaptation option,
   but also to constraints in form of availability of suitable properties,
   ties to local communities, and adverse impacts on biodiversity.
   Implications for adaptation research and practice are outlined. (C) 2010

Abstract = {The awareness on the importance that land subsidence plays on coastal
   processes at the regional scale is increased over the last two decades,
   and it clearly appears that land subsidence can contribute primarily to
   the relative sea level rise affecting coastal zones. Jakarta is one of
   the cities mostly affected by the combination of sea-level rise and land
   subsidence. In this paper, the activities carried out in Jakarta under
   the umbrella of the IGCP Project 663 were presented, and the possible
   measures and best practices mitigating land subsidence for the research
   associates and potential stakeholders were provided, with which can
   serve as inspiration for authorities and communities facing land
   subsidence. Meanwhile, major achievements of IGCP 663 in Jakarta were
   summarized and introduced, including dissemination session, scientific
   session and field trips. Specifically, major advances on coastal
   subsidence studies regarding the effect of relative sea level rise,
   subsidence mapping, monitoring and simulation, as well as the support of
   policy making are highlighted and summarized.},

Title = {Stuck on options and implementation in Hampton Roads, Virginia: an
   integrated conceptual framework for linking adaptation capacity,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {This study focuses on challenges to adaptation to sea level rise (SLR)
   on a regional and multi-sectoral scale. We develop, test, and deploy a
   survey instrument that asks regional stakeholders to assess adaptation
   readiness and identify barriers to regional adaptation. Informed by the
   work of Ford and King (Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Chang 20:505-526, 2015)
   and Moser and Ekstrom (Proc Natl Acad Sci 107:22,026-22,031, 2010), this
   study operationalizes a conceptual framework for diagnosing barriers to
   adaptation readiness and applies it to the specific case of SLR
   adaptation in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia. In
   doing so, this work offers insights from three understudied aspects: (1)
   barriers to adaptation readiness, (2) a regional focus, and (3) a
   multi-sectoral perspective. Our survey results indicate that the key
   barriers to adapting to SLR occur during the planning phase of the
   adaptation process and the transition into the managing phase of the
   process. Almost 60 \% of survey respondents identified implementation as
   one of the three most challenging phases of regional adaptation.
   Fifty-one percent and 36 \% identified development of options and
   selection of options, respectively, as most challenging. Some barriers
   to implementation identified in the survey include conflicting mandates,
   lack of consensus, and lack of financial resources. We examine and
   discuss these barriers and how they can be overcome, allowing us to
   identify and characterize overarching factors essential for creating an
   enabling environment for adaptation. In proposing an integrated
   conceptual framework linking capacity, readiness, and barriers, our
   study thus provides an analytical and practical approach for determining
   adaptation readiness at the regional level, offering implications for
   regional governance and the practice of adaptation that spans multiple
   sectors.},

Title = {A historical typhoon database for the southern and eastern Chinese

Volume = {108},

Abstract = {Historically, typhoons have inflicted significant damage and loss of
   life to coastal communities in Asia. Regional governments, private
   enterprise (including the insurance and re-insurance industries), town
   planners and coastal developers are grappling to find sustainable
   solutions to coastal development while maintaining high rates of
   development and economic growth. Several nations and organisations have
   developed typhoon databases to collate the impacts of typhoons in
   various regions. However, these databases are not comparable or
   consistent in terms of the depth of information provided. This paper
   presents a new typhoon database for southern and eastern Chinese coastal
   regions (SECCR) spanning the period from 1951 to 2012. The database
   comprises comprehensive details of typhoons impacting Hong Kong, Taiwan,
   and the mainland Chinese provinces of Hainan, Fujian, Guangdong and
   Zhejiang. This new database provides an insight into the impacts of
   typhoons upon the economies and casualties suffered in each of the
   SECCR. There were 853 typhoons between 1951 and 2012, 286 typhoons
   caused human casualties, and 228 inflicted economic loss. The data shows
   an overall decrease of fatalities and economic loss. The database also
   shows a downward trend in the percentage of normalized economic loss in
   relation to the regional annual gross domestic product (GDP) for each
   province. The decline in both fatalities and relative economic losses in
   the SECCR may reflect improved adaptation and mitigation strategies to
   the impacts of typhoons in the Chinese coastal region. Further
   examination into the spatial and temporal features of typhoons that
   bring catastrophic damage to the SECCR can be managed with this newly
   developed database. This database can also act as a guide for future
   direction in improving mitigation strategies of the region. (C) 2014

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},

Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Shorelines and their ecosystems are endangered by sea-level rise.
   Nature-based coastal protection is becoming a global strategy to enhance
   coastal resilience through the cost-effective creation, restoration and
   sustainable use of coastal wetlands. However, the resilience to
   sea-level rise of coastal wetlands created under Nature-based Solution
   has been assessed largely on a regional scale. Here we assess, using a
   meta-analysis, the difference in accretion, elevation, and sediment
   deposition rates between natural and restored coastal wetlands across
   the world. Our results show that restored coastal wetlands can trap more
   sediment and that the effectiveness of these restoration projects is
   primarily driven by sediment availability, not by wetland elevation,
   tidal range, local rates of sea-level rise, and significant wave height.
   Our results suggest that Nature-based Solutions can mitigate coastal
   wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise, but are effective only in
   coastal locations where abundant sediment supply is available. Coastal
   wetlands restored by Nature-based Solutions can trap more sediments than
   natural ones, and their efficiency is mainly determined by sediment
   supply, according to a meta-analysis of studies globally.},

Title = {Drought risk assessment in Mediterranean agricultural watersheds: A case
   study in Central Italy},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {271},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Mediterranean watersheds are expected to face increased and more severe
   drought events due to climate change. Urgent action is needed to shift
   from a reactive approach to a proactive one, for which drought risk
   assessment is fundamental. Nevertheless, the current methodology to
   calculate composite risk indicators is still debated, undermining the
   overall robustness and validity of drought risk assessments.
   Furthermore, the diversity of socioecological contexts, spatiotemporal
   scales, and data availability hamper the homogenization of assessment
   methods. We present a complete drought risk assessment methodology,
   applied to the agricultural systems of five Italian coastal watersheds,
   introducing a simple robustness evaluation method to validate the
   assessment tool and archetype analysis to link the outputs with
   adaptation strategies. Forty-two (42) indicators were included to
   represent hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Past and future drought
   hazards were estimated considering multiple types of droughts with data
   from public observatories.The results show highest hazard for the
   southern part of the study region, highest exposure in the coastal and
   high-value wine producers' municipalities, while vulnerability patterns
   are less clear. Major adaptation efforts should target specific
   watersheds of the Grosseto province, which has the highest projected
   drought risk. Archetype analysis was then used to suggest possible
   context-specific adaptation strategies. The proposed methodology, with
   the integration of a robustness evaluation and the archetype analysis,
   represents an advancement toward shared and homogeneous guidelines in
   stateof-the-art drought risk assessments.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change through thermal stress-related coral
   bleaching on coral reefs of the Western Indian Ocean has been well
   documented and is caused by rising sea water temperatures associated
   with background warming trends and extreme climate events. Recent
   studies have identified a number of factors that may reduce the impact
   of coral bleaching and mortality at a reef or sub-reef level. However,
   there is little scientific consensus as yet, and it is unclear how well
   current science supports the immediate needs of management responses to
   climate change. This paper provides evidence from the Western Indian
   Ocean in support of recent hypotheses on coral and reef vulnerability to
   thermal stress that have been loosely termed `resistance and resilience
   to bleaching'. The paper argues for a more explicit definition of terms,
   and identifies three concepts affecting coral-zooxanthellae holobiont
   and reef vulnerability to thermal stress previously termed `resistance
   to bleaching': `thermal protection', where some reefs are protected from
   the thermal conditions that induce bleaching and/or where local physical
   conditions reduce bleaching and mortality levels; `thermal resistance',
   where individual corals bleach to differing degrees to the same thermal
   stress; and `thermal tolerance', where individual corals suffer
   differing levels of mortality when exposed to the same thermal stress.
   `Resilience to bleaching' is a special case of ecological resilience,
   where recovery following large-scale bleaching mortality varies
   according to ecological and other processes. These concepts apply across
   multiple levels of biological organization and temporal and spatial
   scales. Thermal resistance and tolerance are genetic properties and may
   interact with environmental protection properties resulting in
   phenotypic variation in bleaching and mortality of corals. The presence
   or absence of human threats and varying levels of reef management may
   alter the influence of the above factors, particularly through their
   impacts on resilience, offering the opportunity for management
   interventions to mitigate the impacts of thermal stress and recovery on
   coral reefs. These concepts are compiled within an overarching framework
   of spatial resilience theory. This provides a framework for developing
   linked scientific and management questions relating to the larger scale
   impacts of climate change on coral reefs, their management needs and
   prospects for their future. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Future Projection of Precipitation Bioclimatic Indicators over Southeast
   Asia Using CMIP6},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Precipitation is a key meteorological component that is directly related
   to climate change. Quantifying the changes in the precipitation
   bioclimate is crucial in planning climate-change adaptation and
   mitigation measures. Southeast Asia (SEA), home to the world's greatest
   concentration of ecological variety, needs reliable monitoring of such
   changes. This study utilized the global-climate models from phase 6 of
   coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) to examine the variations
   in eight precipitation bioclimatic variables over SEA for two shared
   socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). All indicators were studied for the near
   (2020-2059) and far (2060-2099) futures to provide a better
   understanding of the temporal changes and their related uncertainty
   compared to a historical period (1975-2014). The results showed a high
   geographical variability of the changes in precipitation-bioclimatic
   indicators in SEA. The mainland of SEA would experience more changes in
   the bioclimate than the maritime region. The multimodel ensemble (MME)
   showed an increase in mean annual rainfall of 6.0-12.4\% in most of SEA
   except the Philippines and southern SEA. The increase will be relatively
   less in the wettest month (15\%) and more in the driest month (20.7\%)
   in most of SEA; however, the precipitation in the wettest quarter would
   increase by 2.85\%, while the driest quarter would decrease by 1.0\%.
   The precipitation would be more seasonal. In addition, the precipitation
   would increase over a larger area in the wettest month than in the
   driest month, making precipitation vary more geographically.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic method of countermeasure for
   environmental conservation to harmonize natural environments with
   hydro-power development based on two hydro-power construction in which
   Komatsu conducted directly as a project management in Japan.
   Since the 1990s, Sustainable Development was required in United Nation
   Conference on Environment and Development (the Earth Summit) as a
   commitment.
   In the construction of Okinawa pilot seawater pumped-storage power
   plant, and expanding construction for Okutadami and Otori hydro-power
   developments, project areas were located in biodiversity such as where
   precious endangered animals and birds have inhabited. Therefore, various
   countermeasures for environmental conservation in natural environments
   were proposed in order to harmonize construction of hydro-power
   development with natural environments. The proposed managements were
   systematically conducted by integrating the following measures:
   Basic-countermeasure: design and countermeasure of preventive
   conservation for precious animals before the construction;
   Countermeasure for hardware activities: field investigation for
   analyzing natural phenomenon, application of adaptive management in
   consideration of the conservation for precious animals, replanting in
   modified grounds based on natural resilience;
   Countermeasure for software activities: communication with the persons
   concerned in project, educational activities for the construction
   workers, daily patrols for environmental conservation;
   Eco-site monitoring: monitoring for precious understanding of the
   circumstances in construction area.},

Abstract = {As a crucially important issue that Asia-Pacific region residents are
   currently confronting, this paper treats an increasing probability of
   unusual and extreme natural disasters that continue as a consequence of
   climate change, combined with sea-level rise (SLR). The calculated
   inundation areas in two low-lying regions in Thailand and Japan are
   visualized using a geographical information system (GIS). Results
   suggest that the effect of SLR on increasing inundation is more
   remarkable than that of land subsidence. Therefore, appropriate
   adaptation measures must be undertaken by the respective regions to
   avoid the enormous losses and damage from inundation that are expected
   to derive from the effects of SLR combined with land subsidence.},

Title = {Connectivity, neutral theories and the assessment of species

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},

Abstract = {One of the main adaptation strategies to global change scenarios, aiming
   to preserve ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, is to maximize
   ecosystem resilience. The resilience of a species metapopulation can be
   improved by facilitating connectivity between local populations, which
   will prevent demographic stochasticity and inbreeding. This
   investigation estimated the degree of connectivity among estuarine
   species along the north-eastern Iberian coast, in order to assess
   community vulnerability to global change scenarios. To address this
   objective, two connectivity proxy types have been used based upon
   genetic and ecological drift processes: 1) DNA markers for the bivalve
   cockle (Cerastoderma edule) and seagrass Zostera noltei, and 2) the
   decrease in the number of species shared between two sites with
   geographic distance. Neutral biodiversity theory predicts that dispersal
   limitation modulates this decrease, and this has been explored in
   estuarine plants and macroinvertebrates. Results indicate dispersal
   limitation for both saltmarsh plants and seagrass beds community and Z.
   noltei populations; this suggests they are especially vulnerable to
   expected climate changes on their habitats. In contrast, unstructured
   spatial pattern found in macroinvertebrate communities and in C. edule
   genetic populations in the area suggests that estuarine soft-bottom
   macroinvertebrates with planktonic larval dispersal strategies may have
   a high resilience capacity to moderate changes within their habitats.
   Our findings allow environmental managers to prioritize the most
   vulnerable species and habitats to be restored. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) represents important human-induced alterations
   in local climate that has extensive impacts on urban environments and
   the well-being of urban residents. Under the background of global
   warming and rapid urbanization, UHI effects will be greatly enhanced,
   which will further aggravate urban heatwaves and increase health risks
   to people therein. Therefore, to take adaptive mitigation measures, it
   is essential to thoroughly understand the meteorological mechanism
   responsible for the formation of UHIs. Here, we elucidate the roles of
   the main meteorological parameters in Shanghai's nocturnal UHI intensity
   (UHII) using long-term meteorological data from 1979 to 2013. The
   strongest mean nocturnal UHII values were found in autumn and winter,
   whereas the weakest UHII was found in summer. This seasonal pattern was
   associated with dense cloudiness, high relative humidity and
   precipitation, strong winds, and low atmospheric pressure. Negative
   relationships between the nocturnal UHII and the cloudiness, wind speed,
   relative humidity, and precipitation and a positive correlation between
   the UHII and atmospheric pressure were observed for Shanghai. The
   interactive effects of the wind speed, cloudiness, and relative humidity
   on the UHII indicate that a calm, dry, and clear-sky environment was
   optimal for maximum UHI formation. This study provides insights into the
   mechanisms governing the formation of UHIs and clarifies the key
   meteorological factors. In addition, our results support the accurate
   assessment of future climate change impacts on human health and
   societies by including the UHII as an important assessment index.},

Title = {Assessing climate change vulnerability in Alaska's fishing communities},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Alaska's communities are experiencing impacts from unprecedented
   climate-related changes in the harvests of natural resources. Residents
   of rural Alaska are reporting heretofore unseen changes in the
   geographic distribution and abundance of marine resources, increases in
   the frequency and ferocity of storm surges in the Bering Sea, changes in
   the distribution and thickness of sea ice, and increases in river and
   coastal erosion. When combined with ongoing socio-economic change,
   climate, weather, and changes in the biophysical system interact in a
   complex web of feedbacks and interactions that make life in rural Alaska
   challenging.
   We present a framework of indicators to assess three basic constituents
   of community vulnerability: exposure to the bio-physical effects of
   climate change, dependence on resources that will be affected by climate
   change, and a community's adaptive capacity to offset negative impacts
   of climate change. We conduct three principal components analyses, one
   for each vulnerability constituent, for 315 Alaska communities to assess
   each community's overall vulnerability to climate change. This research

Abstract = {In the kampungs of North Jakarta, people make their lives in the face of
   a variety of transformations. While Jakarta has always experienced
   flooding from the coast and from its rivers, flooding is getting worse,
   and has dramatic effects on kampungs and their residents. At the same
   time, flood mitigation efforts by the government of Jakarta involve new
   infrastructures, such as sea walls and land reclamation, which interrupt
   livelihood practices in the kampungs and have led to violent evictions.
   Residents of North Jakarta's kampungs must negotiate the surprise
   impacts of both flooding and the government's attempts to manage
   flooding. In this article, we catalogue the social and material
   practices that support life and livelihoods in the contexts of these
   urban environmental transformations, drawing from fieldwork conducted in
   three North Jakarta kampungs and from recent critical geographical
   research about urban resilience and urban political ecologies. We
   describe these practices as everyday acts of resilience, reworking, and
   resistance. These everyday practices are social and material, drawing
   from and remaking social and material relations. Although everyday
   practices of resilience, reworking, and resistance require investments
   in social relations, we also demonstrate that the dividends filter
   through existing power structures in the kampungs.},

Abstract = {The accelerated sea level rise and its resulting impacts on the highly
   populated coastal regions bearing significant economic value is one of
   the negative outcomes of climate change. In this study, the most
   vulnerable areas regarding sea level rise in Turkey are defined through
   CVI analysis, and the level of inundation is estimated from
   multi-mission satellite altimetry sea level anomaly, together with
   significant wave heights and the effects of tidal and meteorological
   forcing. Consequently, the maximum level of flooding that is expected to
   occur by 2100 reaches up to 6.7 m in Cukurova Delta which is one of the
   most vulnerable areas of the country, and GIS-based inundation mapping
   on the high resolution elevation model indicates that 69\% of the area
   would be under the risk of flooding. Considering the probable sea level
   rise in Cukurova by the end of this century, immediate adaptive measures
   must be undertaken for the protection of the coastal zone. In addition,
   it will be of utmost importance to make an inventory of the vulnerable
   zones comprising coastal aquifers and ecosystems, and to introduce
   adaptive long-term strategies related to local coastal zone management
   plans.},

Title = {Extreme weather events and farmer adaptation in Zeeland, the
   Netherlands: A European climate change case study from the Rhine delta},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {844},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Global climate change is manifest by local-scale changes in
   precipitation and temperature patterns, including the frequency of
   extreme weather events (EWEs). EWEs are associated with a myriad range
   of adverse environmental and societal consequences, including negative
   impacts to agriculture and food production. This study focuses on EWEs
   and their effect on adaptation strategies by potato and onion farmers in
   Zeeland, a Dutch coastal province in the Rhine delta that can serve as a
   model for other intensive agricultural landscapes in industrialized
   nations impacted by extreme weather events. The research approach
   combines quantitative trend analysis of long-term climatic data
   (temperature, precipitation) with a formal survey of Zeelandic farmers
   to statistically test four specific hypotheses regarding the frequency
   of EWEs in the Netherlands and farmer awareness and adaptation. Trend
   analyses reveal a strong (statistically significant) increase in extreme
   heat, a small increase in extreme rainfall and drought, and a strong
   decrease in frost occurrence. Survey results indicate Zeelandic farmers
   perceive high risk and awareness of changes to the frequency of EWEs.
   Many farmers have experienced financial losses from EWEs, particularly
   between 2017 and 2020. For extreme heat, droughts, and frost, the
   proportion of farmers that incurred financial damages annually is
   statistically correlated to the actual occurrence of EWEs. Farmers who
   incurred more financial losses between 2000 and 2020 due to heat and
   lack of frost had a higher risk perception of these extremes. Further,
   almost all farmers have already implemented one or more adaptation
   strategies. A third of surveyed farmers reduced or stopped with potato
   and onion cultivation in response to climate change and EWEs. Awareness,
   exposure to, and risk perception of EWEs contribute to adaptation
   support by farmers. The high perceived risk of climate change and EWEs
   among respondents and the high incidence of financial losses from
   extremes in the past two decades highlights the importance of adaptation
   in the agricultural sector, including in temperate regions where growing
   seasons are},

Abstract = {The labor relationship developed by the Amazonian riverside dwellers is
   weakened due to changes in temperature, the flood pulse, the ebb tide of
   the rivers, and precipitation. In this context, this research aimed to
   evaluate the impacts of climate change on the socio-biodiversity chains
   in the region of Medio Jurua-Amazonas. Collections were carried out in
   two communities located in the Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS)
   Uacari, in July 2022, through participatory workshops. The communities
   affirm that the extreme flood events of the Jurua River are more intense
   in recent years, both concerning the extreme levels of the river and in
   periodicity and speed of flooding. The large floods have impacted the
   productive calendar, generating losses for farmers. In addition, rubber
   trees and cassava plantations have been dying with the large floods, and
   oil seeds are being carried by the water before harvest. The physical
   data of the Jurua River shows a trend of increasing extreme floods over
   the last 40 years for the period November to April, highlighting the
   years 2013 to 2015 and 2021 with the largest positive anomalies. Farmers
   have adapted their calendars, modified some planting areas to locations
   with higher altitudes and farther from the river banks, and have sought
   new rubber matrices. The results point to the need for mitigation and
   adaptation measures promoted by local governments.},

Abstract = {Sealed surfaces greatly influence Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. In
   this respect, both the composition and spatial patterns of anthropogenic
   land use play an important role in local thermal pattern. The urban
   environments' climate change adaptation strategy needs adequate
   knowledge systems urban planners can use to organise and design more
   resistant and resilient urban spaces. This study examined the
   relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations and
   increasing urbanised areas during the period 2001-2011 in the Po Valley,
   utilising different urban growth spatial patterns (UGSP). Remotely
   sensed LST data was obtained from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer) at a resolution of 1 km/pixel for an 11 year-period,
   from 2001 to 2011, with urbanisation data from the ISTAT map (nominal
   scale 1:10,000) respectively for the 2001 and 2011 time sections. The
   relationship between dependent (mean annual daytime, nighttime and daily
   values) and independent (urbanised areas) variables were investigated
   through ANOVA test and post-hoc analysis (p < 0.01) for all defined
   UGSP. Results showed that there is a decreasing LST range (in all
   conditions) associated with progressive increase of urbanised areas.
   Furthermore, clustered patterns urban growth have a statistically
   significant relationship with daytime, nighttime and daily conditions
   while dispersed pattern urban growth have the same with nighttime only.
   The outcomes are helpful for understanding the effects of different
   UGSP, which have significant implications for urban planning, and
   identifying the critical territorial sectors in need of sustainable
   mitigation actions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate security in the Indo-Pacific: a systematic review of governance
   challenges for enhancing regional climate resilience},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Number = {3-4},

Abstract = {Climate security is a burgeoning focus of the multidisciplinary
   literatures investigating the impacts from climate change. This research
   theme has gained prominence due to the realisation that climatic changes
   will likely compromise human welfare and community stability, with
   significant implications for governments' security agendas. The
   Indo-Pacific region is an important case study for understanding climate
   security given its ongoing environmental and developmental challenges
   and the cultural, political and economic tensions existing within and
   between neighbouring countries. This paper presents a systematic review
   and synthesis of academic and ``grey{''} literatures that address
   climate adaptation, disaster management or regional security in the
   Indo-Pacific. From this review, we identify four key themes that arise
   prominently in discussion and analysis prepared by academic scholars,
   governments and non-government organisations alike. The ubiquity of
   these themes speaks to the interdependent nature of the adaptation,
   disaster management and security challenges. The literature is in
   agreement that maintaining and enhancing climate security in the
   Indo-Pacific will depend on the region's capacity to strategically
   coordinate between the activities of governments, industry and
   communities; the willingness of governments to meaningfully cooperate
   with communities and each other despite existing tensions; governments'
   ability to manage limited resources efficiently; and their capacity to
   identify and address climate-maladaptive path dependencies. We highlight
   the most popular prescriptions for addressing these concurrent
   challenges at the current time. We argue that these prescriptions
   warrant further research and will likely have broader applicability for
   addressing climate security challenges in other regions of the world.},

Abstract = {Heat stress brought on by the intensification of urban heat island (UHI)
   has caused many negative effects on human beings, which were found to be
   more severe in highly urbanized old towns. With the inconsistent
   findings on how urban spatial morphological characteristics influence
   land surface temperature (LST) and gaps between design practices being
   found, we chose Beijing Old Town (BOT) as the study area and took the
   basic planning implementation module ``block{''} as a study to reveal
   the spatial heterogeneity of LST and its relationship to multiple urban
   morphological characteristics with higher spatial resolution calculated
   via WorldView3. Our results have shown that (1) UHI effect was
   significant and spatially heterogeneous in BOT, and significant hot
   areas with high LST value and small LST differences were found, as cold
   areas were the exact opposite. (2) The proportion of vegetated area,
   water, impervious surface, and urban spatial structure indicators i.e.,
   building coverage ratio, mean height, highest building index, height
   fluctuation degree, space crowd degree and sky view factor were
   identified as significantly affecting the LST of blocks in BOT. (3) The
   effects of GBI components and configuration on LST varied within
   different block types; generally, blocks with GBI with larger patches
   that were more complex in shape, more aggregated, and less fragmented
   were associated with lower LST. Finally, in the context of integrating
   our study results with relevant planning and design guidelines, a
   strategy sample of adaptive GBI planning and vegetation design for
   blocks with different morphological features was provided for urban
   planners and managers to make a decision on UHI mitigation in the
   renewal process of BOT.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise threatens coastal salt-marshes and mangrove forests
   around the world, and a key determinant of coastal wetland vulnerability
   is whether its surface elevation can keep pace with rising sea level.
   Globally, a large data gap exists because wetland surface and shallow
   subsurface processes remain unaccounted for by traditional vulnerability
   assessments using tide gauges. Moreover, those processes vary
   substantially across wetlands, so modelling platforms require relevant
   local data. The low-cost, simple, high-precision rod surface-elevation
   table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) method fills this critical data gap, can
   be paired with spatial data sets and modelling and is financially and
   technically accessible to every country with coastal wetlands. Yet, RSET
   deployment has been limited to a few regions and purposes. A coordinated
   expansion of monitoring efforts, including development of regional
   networks that could support data sharing and collaboration, is crucial
   to adequately inform coastal climate change adaptation policy at several
   scales.},

Abstract = {Almost 20 years ago, the first CO2 capture and storage (CCS) project
   began injecting CO2 into a deep geological formation in an offshore
   aquifer. Relevant science has advanced in areas such as chemical
   engineering, geophysics, and social psychology. Governments have
   generously funded demonstrations. As a result, a handful of
   industrial-scale CCS projects are currently injecting about 15 megatons
   of CO2 underground annually that contribute to climate change
   mitigation. However, CCS is struggling to gain a foothold in the set of
   options for dealing with climate change. This review explores why and
   discusses critical conditions for CCS to emerge as a viable mitigation
   option. Explanations for this struggle include the absence of government
   action on climate change, economic crisis-induced low carbon prices,
   public skepticism, increasing costs, and advances in other options
   including renewables and shale gas. Climate change action is identified
   as a critical condition for progress in CCS, in addition to community
   support, safe storage, robust policy support, and favorable CCS market
   conditions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {705-724},
Abstract = {This article presents a study of coastal erosion narratives by the
   Mexican government, scientists, and local fishers in coastal communities
   in the Gulf of Mexico. It shows how plans to enroll fishing communities
   into programs to adapt to or to slow coastal erosion are based on
   simplified environmental narratives that rely on global climate change
   as the main cause of coastal erosion. They discount local processes and
   local explanations, as well as scientific studies that outline complex
   multi-scalar explanations for coastal erosion. Government narratives
   frame global climate change, as manifested in increased frequency and
   intensity of hurricanes and other hydrometereological extreme events and
   sea level rise, as the main causes of changes in coastal environments,
   including coastal erosion They fail to acknowledge other causes
   including the environmental degradation caused by the influential oil
   industry. In contrast, fishers' more complex and locally -embedded
   narratives are shaped by their long-term struggles against the
   state-owned oil company, whom they hold primarily responsible for
   coastal erosion in their communities. Scientists similarly emphasize the
   importance of local and regional processes, with climate change
   understood primarily as having significant impacts in the future, but
   less so in the recent past. Differences in temporal and geographical
   scaling among these narratives highlight the importance of considering
   how the translation of climate change adaptation programming from the
   global to diverse local situations would ideally consider site-specific
   power relations as well as community-based perspectives.},

Title = {Avoiding or mitigating flooding: Bottom-up drivers of urban resilience
   to climate change in the USA},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {59},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal areas around the world are urbanizing rapidly, despite the
   threat of sea level rise and intensifying floods. Such development
   places an increasing number of people and capital at risk, which calls
   for public flood management as well as household level adaptation
   measures that reduce social vulnerability to flooding and climate
   change. This study explores several private adaptation responses to
   flood risk, that are driven by various behavioral triggers. We conduct a
   survey among households in hazard-prone areas in eight coastal states in
   the USA, of which, some have recently experienced major flooding. While
   numerous empirical studies have investigated household-level flood
   damage mitigation, little attention has been given to examining the
   decision to retreat from flood zones. We examine what behavioral motives
   drive the choices for flood damage mitigation and relocation separately
   among property buyers and sellers. Hence, we focus on the drivers that
   shape demand for future development in flood-prone cities. We find that
   households' choices to retreat from or to avoid flood zones (1) are
   highly sensitive to information that provokes people's feelings of fear,
   and (2) rely on hazardous events to trigger a protective action, which
   ideally would take place well before these events occur. We highlight
   that major flooding may cause a potential risk of large-scale
   outmigration and demographic changes in flood- prone areas, putting more
   low-income households at risk. Therefore, coordinated policies that
   integrate bottom- up drivers of individual climate adaptation are needed
   to increase urban resilience to floods.},

Title = {Flood risk assessment and increased resilience for coastal urban
   watersheds under the combined impact of storm tide and heavy rainfall},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {579},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Low-lying coastal cities are vulnerable to flooding under the combined
   impact of storm tide and heavy rainfall. While storm tide or heavy
   rainfall alone is able to directly cause widespread flooding in coastal
   areas, often heavy rainfall and storm tide happen concurrently, and the
   severity of flooding is greatly exacerbated. Current methods for
   understanding flood risk and mapping floodplains normally does not
   clearly communicate either the individual or combined impact of these
   two flooding mechanisms. Flood mitigation strategies typically target
   either rainfall-driven flooding (e.g., stormwater controls) or
   tidally-driven flooding (e.g., flood walls and tide gates). Thus, better
   understanding and communicating the individual and combined flood risk
   resulting from these two mechanisms can be important to improving flood
   resilience. To address this need, this study presents tools and methods
   for floodplain mapping in coastal urban environments were rainfall and
   storm tide driven flooding can be better understood and communicated.
   The approaches are demonstrated for a watershed in Norfolk, VA, USA as a
   case study system using a 1D pipe/2D overland flow hydrodynamic model
   built for the watershed. Storm tide and heavy rainfall events with
   return periods varying from 1 to 100-year were designed based on
   historical observations and combined into a series of compound storm
   scenarios. Then these compound storm scenarios were simulated using the
   hydrodynamic model for simulating flow through both the land surface and
   underground pipe network systems. Results show how the capacity of the
   drainage system, and therefore flood risk reduction, is sensitive to
   storm tide levels, even for less extreme events with a 1-year return
   period. The model also provides new insights into the role of stormwater
   infrastructure in exacerbating flooding risk within communities during
   high sea level conditions. Results demonstrate how dividing the
   floodplain into different regions based on the dominant flooding
   mechanism (rainfall vs. storm tide) makes it possible to better target
   mitigation strategies to improve flood resilience. To this end, a
   transition zone index (TZI) is presented to help decision makers
   identify the change from rainfall-driven to tide-driven flooding for
   locations within a watershed. Finally, we demonstrate how different
   flood mitigation strategies can be tested using this modeling approach
   to better understand their impact on increasing flood resilience within
   the system for portions of the floodplain impacted by rainfall-driven
   and tidal-driven flooding.},

Abstract = {Aestivation is an adaptation of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus
   Selenka to high temperature, however, the causations and physiological
   responses of aestivation are not well understood. This study deals with
   the relationship between temperature and aestivation. Sea cucumbers were
   allocated into four treatments. In two treatments of temperature
   elevation, the ambient temperature gradually was increased from 16
   degrees C to 26 degrees C linearly (treatment FA) or by a fluctuating
   temperature profile (treatment FB). Two control treatments maintained
   constant temperatures of 16 degrees C and 26 degrees C, and were
   designated as optimum temperature of growth and threshold of
   aestivation, respectively. During the 40-day experiment, body weight,
   oxygen consumption, daily food intake, catalase (CAT) and superoxide
   dimutase (SOD) activities and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) levels were
   determined periodically. When the temperature gradually increased from
   16 degrees C to 26 degrees C, the body weight of the tested sea
   cucumbers decreased gradually. After the ambient temperature reached 26
   degrees C, the tested sea cucumbers in treatments of FA and F13 were
   reared at 26 degrees C for an additional twenty days. During this
   period, symptoms of aestivation appeared in the tested sea cucumbers.
   Activities of antioxidases and Hsp70 levels increased when the ambient
   temperature increased from 16 degrees C to 26 degrees C, and decreased
   when the temperature was kept at 26 degrees C. These results indicate
   that aestivation in A. japonicurs is an adaptive strategy to reduce the
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and denatured proteins which
   were induced at high temperature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Characteristics, Progress and Trends of Urban Microclimate Research: A
   Systematic Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change has been a hot topic in recent years. However, the urban
   microclimate is more valuable for research because it directly affects
   people's living environments and can be adjusted by technological means
   to enhance the resilience of cities in the face of climate change and
   disasters. This paper analyses the literature distribution
   characteristics, development stages, and research trends of urban
   microclimate research based on the literature on ``urban
   microclimate{''} collected in the Web of Science core database since
   1990, using CiteSpace and VOSviewer bibliometric software. It is found
   that the literature distribution of the urban microclimate is
   characterized by continuous growth, is interdisciplinary, and can be
   divided into four stages: nascent exploration, model quantification,
   diversified development and ecological synergy. Based on the knowledge
   mapping analysis of keyword clustering, annual overlap, and keyword
   highlighting, it can be predicted that the research on foreign urban
   land patch development has three hot trends-multi-scale modelling,
   multi-factor impact, and multi-policy guidance. The study's findings
   help recognize the literature distribution characteristics and
   evolutionary lineage of urban microclimate research and provide
   suggestions for future urban microclimate research.},

Title = {Suitability evaluation of potential arable land in the Mediterranean
   region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {313},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The existing cultivated land in the Mediterranean region faces great
   pressure from various sources. A suitability evaluation of potential
   arable land is urgent for helping adaptation measures to mitigate the
   impacts of climate change and human pressure on agricultural production
   in the Mediterranean region. We integrated 15 biophysical and
   socio-economic factors from GIS and remote sensing data to perform a
   suitability evaluation of potential arable land in the Mediterranean
   region using analytical hierarchy process and radial basis function
   artificial neural network methods. Moreover, we analyzed the gap between
   potential arable land and existing cultivated land and compared the
   evaluation results between the analytical hierarchy process and
   artificial neural network methods. The results show that the suitability
   index of potential arable land based on artificial neural network with 6
   neurons has the best correlation with average yield and average
   harvested area. The land area with a suitability grade over medium level
   accounts for 62.95\% of the potential arable land area, of which 45.71\%
   is uncultivated land. Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Portugal,
   Spain and Turkey have great opportunities for agricultural development.
   Radial basis function artificial neural network outperforms analytical
   hierarchy process, has better verification results, and requires less
   input. This study provides an initial insight into the agricultural land
   suitability of 16 countries around the Mediterranean Sea and introduces
   a research idea for agricultural land suitability evaluation.},

Title = {Willingness to pay for alternative features of land-use policies: the
   case of the lake Garda region},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {100},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In urban contexts land-use planning can play a central role to promote
   adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change. Limiting soil
   consumption, improving urban greening and restoring abandoned areas are
   three of the most important strategies towards a sustainable land use. .
   The extent to which these three actions can be effectively implemented
   depends on the specific biophysical and cultural characteristics of the
   local context as well as on the preferences of residents . We conducted
   a Choice Experiment (CE) on a sample of 500 people living in four
   municipalities of the lake Garda western coastal strip, in Italy, to
   assess the willingness to pay (WTP) towards these three planning
   strategies based on alternative land-use . The proposed land use
   strategies are presented as a feasible way to improve the mitigation and
   adaptation capacity of the local context. Our results suggest that the
   local community perceives the growth rate of sealed areas as the most
   pressing issue, and people are in favour of measures aimed at containing
   the phenomenon. Efforts in this direction are needed and should inform
   the current policy debate on local land-use planning.},

Abstract = {The global climate change makes the turmoil to coastal community across
   the globe. Hence, in the process building of community policing
   strategies, adaptive capacity of coastal society plays an important role
   to influence change in the community and a mere antagonism for the
   coastal community leader looking to increase effectiveness. Thus, the
   adaptive capacity of a coastal society is a step in building bridges
   between social gaps. This may include the potential, capability or
   ability of a system (human or natural) to adapt to hazards. It
   originates from four inherent or built qualities of the society-norms,
   reciprocity, trust and networks. The coastal socities may have little
   adaptive capacity to gradual changes in environmental alteration, but
   adaptive capacity to change in extreme coastal hazards may not be so
   high. The plethora of studies have been carried out to know comparative
   adaptive capacity and coastal vulnerability and its difficulties are
   well recognized and documented. Results are that the estimates of
   adaptive capacity tend to be based on social, political and economic
   premises. Highly managed system, given sufficient resources are likely
   to be more adaptable than less managed systems. Thus, the present
   chapter gives an overview about adaptive capacity of society against any
   turmoil and the techniques for its measurement for coastal areas.},

Abstract = {Coastal environments worldwide are going to be affected by climate
   change impacts in the future. These environments are densely populated
   especially in Africa and thus such impacts as rising sea level, increase
   in extreme storms and natural hazards, will have a bearing on local,
   regional and national levels. This research looks at environmental
   change, both past and current, on the east coast of Zanzibar, Tanzania
   in terms of the implications of sea level rise, extreme storms and the
   current vulnerability of coastal settlements. Current vulnerabilities in
   the area relate to deforestation, coastal erosion, and differential
   access to and ownership of natural resources. The creation and
   strengthening of coastal forest buffer zones is one of the suggested
   approaches for proactive adaptation, which aims to increase the
   resilience of the natural environment, while producing multiple benefits
   for multiple stakeholders. The study suggests that anticipatory
   adaptation needs to be first and foremost incorporated into the local
   realities in order to be effective and valued. Considering and
   understanding the value judgements and existing priorities among
   multiple stakeholders is crucial since otherwise adaptation efforts will
   remain conflicting and separate processes.},

Abstract = {Cities are particularly affected by climate change impacts. Due to
   global warming, the frequency and intensity of summer heat events
   increases for many cities around the globe. Urban climatological studies
   have shown significant positive trends in the number of hot days and
   tropical nights. Heat stress is an important health as well as economic
   risk. Thus, urban planning needs to adapt to climate change. This
   requires a sound scientific analysis of different adaptation measures
   and management options, which must be based on appropriate data, models
   and scenarios to assess their suitability and efficacy. The goal of this
   paper is to assess the suitability of a low cost weather station network
   consisting of 33 NETATMO weather sensors and ultrasonic anemometers to
   measure air temperature, relative air humidity, wind speed and wind
   direction of a 16 ha study area in Cologne with high temporal and
   spatial resolution to support microclimatological modelling. The
   temperature and humidity sensors were calibrated against a research
   grade reference sensor under laboratory conditions. In addition, a
   research grade meteorological station (Campbell Sci.) was set up in the
   study area as a reference. The NETATMO sensors were placed to identify
   local microclimatic effects due to different surface types, vegetation
   and building structures. Using descriptive statistical analyses and
   pairwise comparisons, significant differences in the microclimatic
   conditions of the various sites were found, which can clearly be
   attributed to specific small scale microclimate factors. Significant
   differences were particularly identified comparing an avenue and a
   narrow street as well as a backyard and an urban park area. The sensors
   proved to provide data reliably and with suitable quality to measure
   microclimatic effects. The choice of sensors lends itself well for
   citizen participation, needed to facilitate climate change adaptation.
   In our further research, the data will be used as reference data for
   microclimatological modelling with ENVI-met investigating particularly
   options of mitigating climate change effects.},

Abstract = {Despite a variety of studies on the tropical cyclone (TC) response to
   climate change, few of them have examined the projected damages of
   future TCs. Here we quantify the impact of anthropogenic warming on
   TC-induced damages in the late twenty-first century along the coasts of
   Southeast China based on convection-permitting TC simulations and
   machine-learning-based damage models. We found that if the area's 10
   super typhoons between 2013 and 2019 were to occur at the end of the
   century under the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario, they would have on
   average a 12\% +/- 4\% increase in landfall intensity, 25\% +/- 23\%
   increase in precipitation, and 128\% +/- 70\% increase in economic
   losses, compared to historical simulations. We also found a significant
   increase in the full risk profile. The estimated typhoon loss with a
   50-year return period for Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan (four
   most typhoon-prone provinces among the seven provinces in the region)
   would increase by 71\%, 170\%, 20\%, and 85\%, respectively, towards the
   end of the century even under the lower emissions RCP4.5 pathway. Our
   findings imply the need to design effective local hazard mitigation
   measures to reduce future typhoon risks.},

Abstract = {Obtaining reliable socioeconomic information on small-scale fisheries
   for use in decision-making at multiple levels of governance remains a
   challenge for conventional approaches to data gathering, analysis, and
   interpretation on a global scale. Fisheries information is most often
   derived from biophysical data rather than human or socioeconomic
   sources. Even where socioeconomic data are used, the complexity of
   small-scale fisheries as adaptive social-ecological systems (SES)
   presents further challenges to aligning information, interventions, and
   objectives. This chapter presents the Global Socioeconomic Monitoring
   Initiative for Coastal Management (SocMon) methodology for assessing the
   social-ecological dynamics of small-scale fisheries. It uses case
   studies from the Caribbean region, where SocMon has been applied for
   over 10 years, and from Brazil, which recently implemented the
   methodology. The cases examine how three features of
   Soc-Moncomprehensive socioeconomic data gathering linked to biophysical
   parameters, participatory methods that include stakeholders in data
   collecting and management, and integrated information and knowledge
   mobilization for decision-making-contribute to better understanding of
   small-scale fisheries dynamics. The cases outline challenges to
   implementing SocMon from a fisheries adaptive co-management perspective.
   The SocMon participatory methodology for monitoring socioeconomic
   dimensions and dynamics was found suitable for informing adaptive
   co-management and developing adaptive capacity in small-scale fisheries.},

Journal = {WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {791-802},

Abstract = {Abrupt ecosystem regime shifts from one state to another can occur in
   response to environmental change (such as climate/sea level change).
   Detecting an approaching tipping point may help management to adapt to
   or mitigate the effects of catastrophic change. Intertidal wetlands are
   one of the most vulnerable ecosystems, faced with climate, sea level and
   anthropogenic changes. Early warning indicators of regime shifts that
   may be evident include slowing recovery rates from perturbation,
   increased autocorrelation and variance, changing skewness and
   self-organised patchiness. We examine these indicators using intertidal
   examples and discuss the limitations. Managers cannot adapt to or
   mitigate the effects of state shifts over tipping points if there is no
   way to detect early warning signals. This detection is highly dependent
   on system-specific modelling and requires understanding of alternate
   stable states theory and its application in large, complex ecosystems.},

Title = {Nutrient enrichment can increase the susceptibility of reef corals to
   bleaching},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {160-164},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching, resulting from the breakdown of coral-algal
   symbiosis has been identified as the most severe threat to coral reef
   survival on a global scale(1). Regionally, nutrient enrichment of reef
   waters is often associated with a significant loss of coral cover and
   diversity(2). Recently, increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   concentrations have been linked to a reduction of the temperature
   threshold of coral bleaching(3), a phenomenon for which no mechanistic
   explanation is available. Here we show that increased levels of
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen in combination with limited phosphate
   concentrations result in an increased susceptibility of corals to
   temperature- and light-induced bleaching. Mass spectrometric analyses of
   the algal lipidome revealed a marked accumulation of sulpholipids under
   these conditions. Together with increased phosphatase activities, this
   change indicates that the imbalanced supply of dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen results in phosphate starvation of the symbiotic algae. Based
   on these findings we introduce a conceptual model that links
   unfavourable ratios of dissolved inorganic nutrients in the water column
   with established mechanisms of coral bleaching. Notably, this model
   improves the understanding of the detrimental effects of coastal
   nutrient enrichment on coral reefs, which is urgently required to
   support knowledge-based management strategies to mitigate the effects of
   climate change.},

Title = {Thresholds in Road Network Functioning on US Atlantic and Gulf Barrier
   Islands},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Barrier islands predominate the Atlantic and Gulf coastlines of the USA,
   where population and infrastructure growth exceed national trends.
   Forward-looking models of barrier island dynamics often include
   feedbacks with real estate markets and management practices aimed at
   mitigating damage to buildings from natural hazards. However, such
   models thus far do not account for networks of infrastructure, such as
   roads, and how the functioning of infrastructure networks might
   influence management strategies. Understanding infrastructure networks
   on barrier islands is an essential step toward improved insight into the
   future dynamics of human-altered barriers. Here, we examine thresholds
   in the functioning of 72 US Atlantic and Gulf Coast barrier islands. We
   use digital elevation models to assign an elevation to each intersection
   in each road network. From each road network we sequentially remove
   intersections, starting from the lowest elevation. We use the maxima of
   the second giant connected component to identify a specific
   intersection-and corresponding elevation-at which functioning of the
   network fails, and we match the elevation of each critical intersection
   to local annual exceedance probabilities for extreme high-water levels.
   We find a range of failure thresholds for barrier island road network
   functioning, and also find that no single metric-absolute elevation,
   annual exceedance probability, or a quantitative metric of
   robustness-sufficiently ranks the susceptibility of barrier road
   networks to failure. Future work can incorporate thresholds for road
   network into forward-looking models of barrier island dynamics that
   include hazard-mitigation practices for protecting infrastructure.},

Title = {Is Europe ready for a results-based approach to fisheries management?
   The voice of stakeholders},

Abstract = {The reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), adopted by the European
   Union in 2013, aims to achieve sustainable exploitation of marine
   resources. Beyond the mainstream of stakeholders' engagement, the
   literature increasingly calls for shared accountability in fisheries
   management. In such scenarios, identifying stakeholders' insights
   becomes critical for a successful design of innovative management
   approaches. This paper analyses how the stakeholders perceive a
   results-based management system for four fisheries in different European
   sea-basins as well as at a pan-European level. The results indicate a
   need for adaptive and participatory management approaches, building on
   regional adaptations within transparent and plural frameworks for
   fisheries. To succeed, the system should explicitly address its
   associated public and private costs; neither participation nor
   accountability comes for free. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Final and other layers of road structures and their corresponding
   elements significantly affect the generation of heat islands in areas in
   which they are located Air temperature increases in relation to the
   surrounding areas during the formation of heat islands. This paper
   presents the results of field research which measured the temperature of
   all elements of two road underpasses, which are integral parts of the D7
   (E73) state road in the city of Osijek, the Republic of Croatia. The
   tests were conducted from April to November 2014. The aim of the
   performed tests was to determine the effects of solar radiation on the
   temperature of constituent elements of road underpasses. The
   measurements were performed with the aim of determining the dependence
   of location of individual elements of the construction in space and
   material properties of which the same are made. The obtained test
   results indicate that the temperatures of the observed elements of the
   road underpasses significantly vary depending on the position within the
   construction, surface albedo and external weather conditions.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {127},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {493-504},

Abstract = {With rising sea levels and possible storm intensification due to climate
   change, current United States urban coastal flood management strategies
   will be challenged. Due to limitations of current flood management
   strategies, evacuation is likely to become increasingly prominent in
   many coastal areas. Thus it is important to think critically about
   challenges for successful evacuation planning, particularly for
   vulnerable communities. This paper brings together the evacuation
   planning, climate change and environmental justice literatures. We
   describe the unique challenges that environmental justice communities
   face with evacuation, and identify best practice guidelines to improve
   the quality of evacuation planning for these communities. The guidelines
   presented, while not comprehensive, provide a framework for planners and
   policymakers to consider when developing evacuation plans, both for
   current and future climate conditions, and could improve the quality of
   evacuation planning.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {This study examines the social-psychological determinants of
   climate-related civic engagement among residents of Lake Superior's
   nature-based, tourism-dependent North Shore region in Minnesota.
   Specifically, it assesses the influence of two dimensions of community
   attachment (social and environmental) and environmental concern on civic
   engagement. Data were collected using a self-administered mail survey of
   1000 residents in the two Lake Superior watersheds that constitute the
   majority of the North Shore region. Data were analyzed using structural
   equation modeling. Findings indicate that residents' social attachment
   to their communities is a significant predictor of their climate-related
   civic engagement. Further, their environmental attachment-while not by
   itself a predictor--is significantly related to heightened concern about
   the impacts of climate change on the local environment, which is a
   significant predictor of residents' civic engagement. These findings
   reinforce a two-dimensional understanding of community attachment and
   they are pertinent for natural resource professionals and community
   leaders tasked with engaging residents in climate-mitigating or
   -adaptive actions. They suggest that programmatic outcomes may be
   enhanced by accentuating the local social and economic consequences of
   climate change, and the impacts to local natural resources. This may be
   especially valuable in nature tourism-based economies where altered
   climatic conditions could more drastically impact the economic
   well-being of communities.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion is a complex problem, mainly in terms of its effects and
   management strategies. Based on the increasing coastal erosion problem,
   it is crucial to ensure shore protection, considering all stakeholders'
   perspectives. This research investigates users' preferences for various
   options to deal with costal erosion, through a discrete choice
   experiment, and concludes that the respondents prefer some interventions
   to mitigate the problem than no action, and prefer lighter intervention
   (palisades, gangways) to heavy infrastructures (rockfills, seawalls,
   groynes). Moreover, the results show the presence of preference
   heterogeneity and thus the need to use more flexible and complex models.
   Based on the results obtained it is possible to drive some policy
   implications. First, the do-nothing option is not viable from the
   population standpoint; second, although some time of coastal erosion
   protection is demanded by the general population, the preferred approach
   is for light forms, contrary to the policy adopted in the last century,
   and that which still characterizes most existent coastal defense
   infrastructures. Lastly, there is considerable heterogeneity in
   respondents' preferences, demanding careful consideration of the welfare
   impact of coastal interventions on population segments.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses future prospects for climate change, impacts and
   adaptation of three small islands in Solomon Islands. Based on a review
   of literature a climate change scenario is suggested and with point of
   departure in a survey of three characteristics of the islands -
   bio-physical conditions, economic base and social organization - the
   exposure, sensitivity and adaptation options of island populations are
   analyzed. It is argued that the three islands are likely to be very
   differently affected for reasons related to all three categories of
   characteristics. Local adaptive capacity is likely to be insufficient,
   especially in the case of Ontong Java (which is an atoll), and economic,
   social, institutional and political factors, external to the islands,
   will be of increasing importance.},

   groundwater temperatures of up to 9 degrees C above the natural state in
   the city of Basel, Switzerland. The urban thermal groundwater regime is
   influenced by: (1) urbanization and annual heating periods; (2) thermal
   groundwater use; (3) seasonal trends; (4) river-groundwater interaction;
   and (5) climate change and consequences thereof.
   The combination of short- and long-term data analysis, including
   conventional and high-resolution multilevel groundwater temperature
   monitoring, as well as 3D numerical groundwater flow and heat-transport
   modeling allowed quantifying the thermal influences on the investigated
   urban groundwater body. Results facilitate to describe the ``present
   state{''} of the urban thermal groundwater regime and to derive a
   ``potential natural state{''} of the investigated groundwater body.
   The study originated from a request of the executive council to provide
   a basis for cost estimates of infrastructure adaptation measures
   necessary to mitigate the impact of climate change. It is shown that the
   principal trigger for the observed thermal development is not climate
   change but that local and regional anthropogenic factors are dominating.
   Although in urban areas, groundwater is increasingly used for cooling
   purposes; the geothermal potential, resulting from elevated groundwater
   temperatures, is generally not exploited. The presented approach
   provides a basis for the setup of combined and thermally balanced
   heating and cooling systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Regional spatio-temporal assessment of extreme precipitation is
   essential to develop better climate adaptation and mitigation
   strategies. This study evaluated trends in precipitation extremes from
   1985 to 2014 in the Kelantan River Basin (KRB), Malaysia. Forty-one
   climate stations that had <10\% missing data, and which passed the data
   quality control and homogeneity tests were selected. Trends of 14
   precipitation extreme indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate
   Change Detection and Indices that related to duration, threshold,
   absolute, relative and percentile indices were analysed using the
   Mann-Kendall and Sen's tests. Generally, most of the regional
   precipitation extremes' indices had increased trends, except the
   consecutive dry days and consecutive wet days, which are quite
   consistent with global scale trends studies. On a monthly scale, the
   maximum 5-day precipitation amount (Rx5d) had increasing trends in
   January (34.91mmdecade(-1)) and December (13.96mmdecade(-1)), by field
   significance at 95\% confidence level. For spatial context, most of the
   stations with significant trends were distributed in the south-western
   (mountainous) and northern (near-coastal) regions. In the Tropics, the
   KRB's extremes indices trends had a similar pattern to the West Pacific,
   Indian Ocean and Caribbean regions, but were different from Western
   Thailand, the South China Sea and the North Inter-tropical Convergence
   Zone, showing that trends of precipitation extreme events are different
   regionally. Overall, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Multivariate
   El-Nino Southern Oscillation Index, Indian Ocean Dipole and
   Madden-Julian Oscillation had a significant relationship with all
   precipitation extremes' indices, and they are contributors to climate
   changes in this basin.},

Title = {Assessing coastal vulnerability to climate change: comparing
   segmentation at global and regional scales},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-65},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent concerns about potential climate-change effects on coastal
   systems require the application of vulnerability assessment tools in
   order to define suitable adaptation strategies and improve coastal zone
   management effectiveness. In fact, while various research efforts were
   devoted to evaluate coastal vulnerability to climate change on a
   national to global level, fewer applications were carried out so far to
   develop more comprehensive and site-specific vulnerability assessments
   suitable to plan possible adaptation measures at the regional scale. In
   this respect, specific indicators are needed to address
   climate-change-related issues for coastal zones and to identify
   vulnerable areas at the regional level. Two sets of coastal
   vulnerability indicators were selected, one for regional and one for
   global studies, respectively, concerning the same features of coastal
   systems, including topography and slope, geomorphological
   characteristics, presence and distribution of wetlands and vegetation
   cover, density of coastal population and number of coastal inhabitants.
   The proposed set of indicators for the regional scale was chosen taking
   into account the availability of environmental and territorial data for
   the whole coastal area of the Veneto region and was based on
   site-specific datasets characterized by a spatial resolution appropriate
   for a regional analysis. Moreover, a GIS-based segmentation procedure
   was applied to divide the coastline into linear segments, homogeneous in
   terms of vulnerability to climate change and sea-level rise at the
   regional scale. This approach allowed to divide the Veneto shoreline
   into 140 segments with an average length of about 1 km, while the global
   scale approach identified four coastal segments with an average length
   of about 66 km. The performed comparison indicated how the more detailed
   approach adopted at the regional scale is essential to understand and
   manage the complexities of the specific study area. In fact, the 25-m
   DEM employed at the regional scale provided a more accurate
   differentiation of the coastal area's elevation and thus of coastal
   susceptibility to the inundation risks, compared to the 1-km DEM used at
   the global level. Moreover, at the regional level the use of a 1: 20,000
   geomorphological map allowed to differentiate the unique landform class
   detected at the global level (e. g., fluvial plain) in a variety of more
   detailed coastal typologies (e. g., open coast eroding sandy shores
   backed by bedrock) characterized by a different sensitivity to climate
   change and sea-level rise. Accordingly, the information provided by
   regional indicators can support decision-makers in improving the
   management of coastal resources by considering the potential impacts of
   climate change and in the definition of appropriate actions to reduce
   inundation risks, to avoid the potential loss of valuable wetlands and
   vegetation and to plan the nourishment of sandy beaches subject to
   erosion processes.},

Title = {Sea-level rise and resilience in Vietnam and the Asia-Pacific: A
   synthesis},
Journal = {VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {126-152},
Abstract = {Climate change induced sea-level rise (SLR) is on its increase globally.
   Regionally the lowlands of China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and islands of
   the Malaysian, Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos are among the
   world's most threatened regions. Sea-level rise has major impacts on the
   ecosystems and society. It threatens coastal populations, economic
   activities, and fragile ecosystems as mangroves, coastal salt-marches
   and wetlands. This paper provides a summary of the current state of
   knowledge of sea level-rise and its effects on both human and natural
   ecosystems. The focus is on coastal urban areas and low lying deltas in
   South-East Asia and Vietnam, as one of the most threatened areas in the
   world. About 3 mm per year reflects the growing consensus on the average
   SLR worldwide. The trend speeds up during recent decades. The figures
   are subject to local, temporal and methodological variation. In Vietnam
   the average values of 3.3 mm per year during the 1993-2014 period are
   above the worldwide average. Although a basic conceptual understanding
   exists that the increasing global frequency of the strongest tropical
   cyclones is related with the increasing temperature and SLR, this
   relationship is insufficiently understood. Moreover the precise, complex
   environmental, economic, social, and health impacts are currently
   unclear. SLR, storms and changing precipitation patterns increase flood
   risks, in particular in urban areas. Part of the current scientific
   debate is on how urban agglomeration can be made more resilient to flood
   risks. Where originally mainly technical interventions dominated this
   discussion, it becomes increasingly clear that proactive special
   planning, flood defense, flood risk mitigation, flood preparation, and
   flood recovery are important, but costly instruments. Next to the main
   focus on SLR and its effects on resilience, the paper reviews main SLR
   associated impacts: Floods and inundation, salinization, shoreline
   change, and effects on mangroves and wetlands. The hazards of SLR
   related floods increase fastest in urban areas. This is related with
   both the increasing surface major cities are expected to occupy during
   the decades to come and the increasing coastal population. In particular
   Asia and its megacities in the southern part of the continent are
   increasingly at risk. The discussion points to complexity,
   interdisciplinarity, and the related uncertainty, as core
   characteristics. An integrated combination of mitigation, adaptation and
   resilience measures is currently considered as the most indicated way to
   resist SLR today and in the near future. (c) 2018 Vietnam Academy of

Title = {Values, rules and knowledge: Adaptation as change in the decision
   context},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {60-69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Responding to global change represents an unprecedented challenge for
   society. Decision makers tend to address this challenge by framing
   adaptation as a decision problem, whereby the responses to impacts of
   change are addressed within existing decision processes centred on
   defining the decision problem and selecting options. However, this
   `decision-making perspective' is constrained by societal values and
   principles, regulations and norms and the state of knowledge. It is
   therefore unsuitable for addressing complex, contested, cross-scale
   problems. In this paper we argue that simply broadening the decision
   making perspective to account for institutions and values is not enough.
   We contend the decision-malting perspective needs to be connected with a
   broader `decision-context perspective' that focuses on how the societal
   system of decision processes affects the manner in which a particular
   problem is addressed. We describe the decision context as an
   interconnected system of values, rules and knowledge (vrk). The
   interaction of systems of vrk both creates and limits the set of
   practical, permissible decisions; the types of values, rules and
   knowledge that influence the decision and the capacity for change and
   transformation in the decision context. We developed a framework to
   analyse the interactions between values, rules and knowledge and their
   influence on decision making and decision contexts of adaptation
   initiatives, and applied it retrospectively to three projects on
   adaptation to sea-level rise. Our analysis revealed: (1) specific
   examples of how interactions between vrk systems constrained existing
   framings of decision making and the development of options for coastal
   adaptation; (2) limitations in the adaptive management strategies that
   underpinned the projects and (3) how the linked systems of vrk can allow
   adaptation practitioners to structure adaptation as a process of
   co-evolutionary change that enables a broader set of social issues and
   change processes to be considered. Adaptation projects that focus on the
   decision context represent a pragmatic alternative to existing
   decision-focused adaptation. By using the vrk model to diagnose
   constraints in decision processes, we show how the reframing of
   adaptation initiatives can reveal new approaches to developing
   adaptation responses to complex global change problems. (C) 2015 The

Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {In recent years, nature-based solutions are receiving increasing
   attention in the field of disaster risk reduction and climate change
   adaptation as inclusive, no regret approaches. Ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) can mitigate the impacts of climate change, build
   resilience and tackle environmental degradation thereby supporting the
   targets set by the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai
   Framework. Despite these benefits, EbA is still rarely implemented in
   practice. To better understand the barriers to implementation, this
   research examines policy-makers' perceptions of EbA, using an extended
   version of Protection Motivation Theory as an analytical framework.
   Through semi-structured interviews with policy-makers at regional and
   provincial level in Central Vietnam, it was found that EbA is generally
   considered a promising response option, mainly due to its multiple
   ecosystem-service benefits. The demand for EbA measures was largely
   driven by the perceived consequences of natural hazards and climate
   change. Insufficient perceived response efficacy and time-lags in
   effectiveness for disaster risk reduction were identified as key
   impediments for implementation. Pilot projects and capacity building on
   EbA are important means to overcome these perceptual barriers. This
   paper contributes to bridging the knowledge-gap on political
   decision-making regarding EbA and can, thereby, promote its
   mainstreaming into policy plans.},

Title = {The Asset Drivers, Well-being Interaction Matrix (ADWIM): A
   participatory tool for estimating future impacts on ecosystem services
   and livelihoods},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {69-82},
Abstract = {Building an effective response for communities to climate change
   requires decision-support tools that deliver information which
   stakeholders find relevant for exploring potential short and long-term
   impacts on livelihoods. Established principles suggest that to
   successfully communicate scientific information, such tools must be
   transparent, replicable, relevant, credible, flexible, affordable and
   unbiased. In data-poor contexts typical of developing countries, they
   should also be able to integrate stakeholders' knowledge and values,
   empowering them in the process. We present a participatory tool, the
   Asset Drivers Well-being Interaction Matrix (ADWIM), which estimates
   future impacts on ecosystem goods and services (EGS) and communities'
   well-being through the cumulative effects of system stressors. ADWIM
   consists of two modelling steps: an expert-informed, cumulative impact
   assessment for EGS; which is then integrated with a stakeholder-informed
   EGS valuation process carried out during adaptation planning workshops.
   We demonstrate the ADWIM process using examples from Nusa Tenggara Barat
   Province (NTB) in eastern Indonesia. The semi-quantitative results
   provide an assessment of the relative impacts on EGS and human
   well-being under the `Business as Usual' scenario of climate change and
   human population growth at different scales in NTB, information that is
   subsequently used for designing adaptation strategies. Based on these
   experiences, we discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of ADWIM
   relative to principles of effective science communication and ecosystem
   services modelling. ADWIM's apparent attributes as an analysis, decision
   support and communication tool promote its utility for participatory
   adaptation planning. We also highlight its relevance as a `boundary
   object' to provide learning and reflection about the current and likely
   future importance of EGS to livelihoods in NTB. (C) 2015 Commonwealth

Title = {Effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on photosynthetic performance and

   Neoporphyra haitanensis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {199},

Abstract = {The effects of enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation
   reaching the Earth's surface has become an important issue in
   terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Living in the land-marine boundary,
   intertidal macroalgae have various adaptive strategies to resist drastic
   environmental changes. In this study, we investigated the effects of
   enhanced UV-B radiation on the photosynthetic performance and
   photoprotective mechanisms of the red macroalgae Neoporphyra
   haitanensis. Our results showed that increasing UV-B radiation inhibited
   growth, damaged chloroplast structures and photosynthetic pigments, and
   reduced PSII activity and recovery ability in N. haitanensis. UV-B
   radiation significantly increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ),
   indicating that NPQ is an effective photoprotection strategy in N.
   haitanensis. The transthylakoid proton gradient (delta pH) uncoupler
   ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) significantly inhibited NPQ induction, showing
   that the induction of NPQ in N. haitanensis was dependent on delta pH.
   Furthermore, violaxanthin and antheraxanthin, essential components of
   the xanthophyll cycle for modulating NPQ, were not detected in N.
   haitanensis, indicating the absence of the xanthophyll cycle in N.
   haitanensis. However, the increased NPQ under UV-B radiation was still
   associated with the accumulation of zeaxanthin. These findings will be
   useful for revealing adaptive strategies of intertidal macroalgae to
   cope with increasing UV-B radiation in the future.},

Abstract = {Four accelerated sea level rise scenarios, 30 and 100 cm by the year
   2100, and 10 and 30 cm by the year 2030, have been assumed as boundary
   conditions (along with some wind climate changes) for the entire Polish
   coast, under two recent programmes completed in 1992 and 1995, Three
   adaptation strategies, i.e., retreat, limited protection and full
   protection have been adopted and compared in physical and socio-economic
   terms. Over 2,200 km(2) and 230,000 people are found vulnerable in the
   most severe case of 100-cm rise by 2100. The total cost of land at loss
   in that case is estimated at nearly 30 USD billion (plus some 18 USD
   billion at risk of flooding), while the cost of full protection reaches
   6 USD billion. Particular features of vulnerability and adaptation
   schemes have been examined as well, including specific sites and the
   effects of not only sea level rise but also other climate change
   factors, and interactions with other climate change studies in Poland.
   Planning of coastal zone management facing climate change can be
   facilitated by the use of a GIS-supported coastal information and
   analysis system. An example of the application of such a system for a
   selected Polish coastal site is shown to illustrate the most recent
   smaller-scale research activities undertaken in the wake of the overall
   assessment of the vulnerability to climate change for the entire Polish
   coastal zone.},

   sensitivity, and susceptibility to extreme weather events. ``Climate

   practices that adversely affect climate systems. ``Civic capacity{''}
   estimates human capital and environmental concern variables that
   constitute a metro area's ability to commit to policy initiatives.
   Statistical results indicate that high stressor areas are significantly
   less likely to participate in the CCP campaign, and metros high in civic
   capacity are significantly more likely to commit to the CCP campaign.},

Volume = {17},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Vanuatu is a small island state ranked the most at-risk for natural
   hazards globally. Access to safe and secure water is limited,
   particularly for poor and rural residents. It is projected that climate
   change will increase temperatures, sea level, cyclone intensity, and
   extreme rainfall events in Vanuatu. As the impacts of climate change
   become clearer, it is becoming easier to predict the consequences of
   those changes on water infrastructure. The Government of Vanuatu,
   Department of Water Resources (DoWR) wants to support communities to
   enhance the resilience of community water supply infrastructure, despite
   the additional challenge of climate change. Since 2013, DoWR has adapted
   Water Safety Plans to the local context with Drinking Water Safety and
   Security Plans (DWSSPs). An analysis of actions taken after 199 DWSSPs,
   site visits and interviews, revealed an opportunity to integrate climate
   change more into existing community risk planning processes. The
   analysis also identified many potential problems with existing water
   infrastructure that increase their exposure to climate risks as well as
   possible improvements to decrease those risks. As a result, adjustments
   were made to the current water safety planning approach, so that
   communities review hazards associated with climate change and identify
   resilient infrastructure improvements.},

Title = {Climate change impacts on rural poverty in low-elevation coastal zones},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {A1-A13},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {This paper identifies the low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ) populations
   and developing regions most vulnerable to sea-level rise and other
   coastal hazards, such as storm surges, coastal erosion and salt-water
   intrusion. The focus is on the rural poor in the LECZ, as their economic
   livelihoods are especially endangered both directly by coastal hazards
   and indirectly through the impacts of climate change on key coastal and
   near-shore ecosystems. Using geo-spatially referenced malnutrition and
   infant mortality data for 2000 as a proxy for poverty, this study finds
   that just 15 developing countries contain over 90\% of the world's LECZ
   rural poor. Low-income countries as a group have the highest incidence
   of poverty, which declines somewhat for lower middle-income countries,
   and then is much lower for upper middle-income economies. South Asia,
   East Asia and the Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa account for most of the
   world's LECZ rural poor, and have a high incidence of poverty among
   their rural LECZ populations. Although fostering growth, especially in
   coastal areas, may reduce rural poverty in the LECZ, additional policy
   actions will be required to protect vulnerable communities from
   disasters, to conserve and restore key coastal and near-shore
   ecosystems, and to promote key infrastructure investments and coastal
   community response capability. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Effects of spatial pattern of greenspace on urban cooling in a large

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {35-47},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban areas will experience the greatest increases in temperature
   resulting from climate change due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect.
   Urban greenspace mitigates the UHI and provides cooler microclimates.
   Field research has established that temperatures within parks or beneath
   trees can be cooler than in non-greenspaces, but little is known about
   the effects of the spatial pattern of greenspace on urban temperatures
   or the optimal spatial patterns needed to cool an urban environment.
   Here, urban cool islands (UCIs) and greenspace in Nanjing, China were
   identified from satellite data and the relationship between them
   analyzed using correlation analyses. The results indicate the following:
   (1) Areas with a higher percentage of forest-vegetation experience a
   greater cooling effect and a 10\% increase in forest-vegetation area
   resulted in a decrease of about 0.83 degrees C in surface temperature;
   (2) A correlation analysis between mean patch size, patch density, and
   an aggregation index of forest vegetation with temperature reduction
   showed that for a fixed amount of forest vegetation, fragmented
   greenspaces also provide effective cooling; (3) The spatial pattern of
   UCIs was strongly correlated with greenspace patterns; a mainland-island
   greenspace spatial configuration provided an efficient means of
   enhancing the cooling effects; and (4) the intensity of the cooling
   effect was reflected in cool island characteristics. These findings will
   support better prediction of the effects of specific amounts and spatial
   arrangements of greenspace, helping city managers and planners mitigate
   increasing temperatures associated with climate change. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Global climate change is likely to have a range of consequences for
   human health as a result of disturbance or weakening of the biosphere's
   natural or human-managed Life support systems. The full range of
   potential human health impacts of global climate change is diverse and
   would be distributed differentially spatially and over time. Changes in
   the mortality toll of heatwaves and changes in the distribution of
   vector-borne infectious diseases may occur early. The public health
   consequences of sea level rise and of regional changes in agricultural
   productivity may not occur (or become apparent) for several decades.
   Vulnerability is a measure of both sensitivity to climate change and the
   ability to adapt in anticipation of, or in response to, its impacts. The
   basic modes of adaptation to climate-induced health hazards are
   biological, behavioural and social. Adaptation can be undertaken at the
   individual, community and whole-population levels. Adaptive strategies
   should not introduce new health hazards. Enhancement of the acknowledged
   public health infrastructure and intervention programmes is essential to
   reduce vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change. In the
   longer-term, fundamental improvements in the social and material
   conditions of life and in the reduction of inequalities within and
   between populations are required for sustained reduction in
   vulnerability to environmental health hazards.},

Volume = {7},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1235-1269},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise sits at the frontier of usable climate climate change
   research, because it involves natural and human systems with long lags,
   irreversible losses, and deep uncertainty. For example, many of the
   measures to adapt to sea-level rise involve infrastructure and land-use
   decisions, which can have multigenerational lifetimes and will further
   influence responses in both natural and human systems. Thus, sea-level
   science has increasingly grappled with the implications of (1) deep
   uncertainty in future climate system projections, particularly of human
   emissions and ice sheet dynamics; (2) the overlay of slow trends and
   high-frequency variability (e.g., tides and storms) that give rise to
   many of the most relevant impacts; (3) the effects of changing sea level
   on the physical exposure and vulnerability of ecological and
   socioeconomic systems; and (4) the challenges of engaging stakeholder
   communities with the scientific process in a way that genuinely
   increases the utility of the science for adaptation decision making.
   Much fundamental climate system research remains to be done, but many of
   the most critical issues sit at the intersection of natural sciences,
   social sciences, engineering, decision science, and political economy.
   Addressing these issues demands a better understanding of the coupled
   interactions of mean and extreme sea levels, coastal geomorphology,
   economics, and migration; decision-first approaches that identify and
   focus research upon those scientific uncertainties most relevant to
   concrete adaptation choices; and a political economy that allows usable
   science to become used science.},

Abstract = {Natural World Heritage (WH) sites are globally recognized as having
   universal value, providing society with critical ecosystem services like
   biodiversity, clean water, and recreational opportunity. Every natural
   WH site is at risk from climate change, but the scope and nature of that
   risk varies widely. Climate change adaptation is a wicked problem; that
   is, there are no clear-cut solutions and stakeholders at each site
   disagree on values, norms and first steps, making adaptation difficult.
   Yet, delaying action poses more risks than taking action under
   uncertainty. I synthesize the refereed literature relevant to climate
   adaptation for natural WH sites. I argue that adaptation should be
   ecosystem based. It should begin by understanding linkages among site
   attributes and the surrounding landscape, and asking how off-site and
   on-site practices might reduce risk of negative effects of climate
   change on those attributes. Adaptation responses are tiered. Fine-scale,
   on-site responses are less expensive and easier but will have less
   impact than coarse-scale responses involving the surrounding community.
   We cannot precisely predict future conditions so we must act adaptively,
   designing responses, acting, evaluating results, re-designing and trying
   again. Action is constrained by institutional mandates focused on
   preserving existing conditions rather than recognizing a dynamic future.
   Climate change adaptation at natural WH sites should be Adaptive,
   Participatory and Transformative, deployed through clumsy solutions.
   Such solutions will require strong leadership and excellent
   communication, drawing together widely disparate views and iterative
   practices focusing on resilience. That requirement establishes the need
   for capacity development for climate change adaptation. (C) 2014

Title = {Ecosystem Mercury Recovery and Health Benefit Under the Minamata
   Convention in a Changing Climate},
Journal = {REVIEWS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {260},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a toxic metal that can be released from natural and
   anthropogenic processes. Gaseous elemental Hg is the main form of Hg in
   the atmosphere with a long residence time, allowing its long-range
   transport and deposition at a global scale. The deposited Hg can be
   transformed into methylmercuy (MeHg), which bioaccumulates and
   biomagnifies in aquatic ecosystems and is a known developmental
   neurotoxin to humans. Chronic exposure in pregnant women via fish
   consumption, even at the modest levels, can impact intellectual
   development in infants, which is considered as a global environmental
   health issue. To protect human health and the environment, the Minamata
   Convention on Mercury, a legally binding international treaty, entered
   into force in 2017 to reduce anthropogenic emissions and releases of Hg
   and Hg compounds. With the enforcement of the Convention, anthropogenic
   Hg emissions and releases are projected to decrease in the foreseeable
   future, but the recovery of the ecosystem and mitigation of health
   impact from Hg pollution are expected to lag behind. In this paper, we
   provide a critical review on the processes affecting when and to which
   extent Hg-affected ecosystems will recover under the Minamata Convention
   in the context of climate change and associated human health benefit.
   Our review is organized around seven major scientific questions. These
   seven questions covered historical Hg change in the ecosystem, major
   factors and processes, and future assessment. The impact of
   implementation of Minamata Convention and climate change on Hg emission,
   atmospheric transportation and deposition, biota accumulation, and human
   exposure should be comprehensively evaluated. The Hg stable isotope tool
   and process-based integrated global model should be integrated together,
   which also should consider future global social-economic pathways and
   mitigation options. We hope that the knowledge gaps and potential tools
   identified will assist the understanding of global biogeochemical
   cycling of Hg, inform policy-making on mitigation and community
   adaptation, and support the effectiveness evaluation and future
   improvement of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.},

Title = {Climate change impacts shifting landscape of the dairy industry in
   Hawai'i},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Proper knowledge and understanding of climatic variability across
   different seasons are important in farm management.To learn more about
   the potential effects of climate change on dairying in Hawaii, we
   conducted a study on site-specific climate characterization using
   several variables including rainfall, wind speed (WS), solar radiation,
   and temperature, at two dairy farms located on Hawai'i Island, Hawai'i,
   in Ookala named ``OK DAIRY{''} and in Upolu Point named ``UP DAIRY.{''}
   Temperature-humidity index (THI) and WS variations in the hottest four
   months (June to September) were analyzed to determine when critical
   thresholds that affect animal health are exceeded. Rainfall data were
   used to estimate the capacity of forage production in 6-mo wet (November
   to April) and dry (May to October) seasons. Future projections of
   temperature and rainfall were assessed using mid- and end-century
   gridded data products for low (RCP 4.5) and high emissions (RCP 8.5)
   scenarios. Our results showed that the ``OK DAIRY{''} site received
   higher rainfall than the ``UP DAIRY{''} site, favoring grass growth and
   forage availability. In addition, the ``UP DAIRY{''} site was more
   stressful for animals during the summer (THI 69 to 73) than the ``OK
   DAIRY{''} site (THI 67 to 70) as the THI exceeded the critical threshold
   of 68, which is conducive for high-lactating cattle. On the ``UP
   DAIRY{''} site, the THI did not drop below 68 during the summer nights,
   which created fewer opportunities for cattle to recover from heat
   stress. Future projections indicated that air temperature would increase
   1.3 to 1.8 degrees C by mid-century and 1.6 to 3.2 degrees C by the
   end-century at both farms, and rainfall will increase at the ``OK
   DAIRY{''} site and decrease at the ``UP DAIRY{''} site by the
   end-century. The agriculture and livestock industries, particularly the
   dairy and beef subsectors in Hawaii, are vulnerable to climate changes
   as higher temperatures and less rainfall will have adverse effects on
   cattle. The findings in this study demonstrated how both observed and
   projected changes in climate support the development of long-term
   strategies for breeding and holistic livestock management practices to
   adapt to changing climate conditions.},

Title = {Future projections of flood dynamics in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {742},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The annual flood pulse of the Mekong River is crucial to sustain
   agriculture production, nutrition, and the livelihood of millions of
   people living in the Vietnamese part of the Mekong Delta (VMD). However,
   climate change impacts on precipitation, temperature and sea-level
   combined with land subsidence, upstream hydropower development, and
   water infrastructures (i.e. high-dykes construction) are altering the
   hydrological regime of the VMD. This study investigates future changes
   in flood hazard and agricultural production caused by these different
   scales of human-induced stresses. A quasi- two-dimensional (quasi-2D)
   hydrodynamic model was used to simulate eight scenarios representing the
   individual and compound impacts of these drivers for a baseline
   (1971-2000) and future (2036-2065) period. The scenarios map the most
   likely future pathway of climate change (RCP 4.5) combined with the best
   available Mekong upstream hydropower development, and land subsidence
   scenarios as well as the current delta development plan. We found that
   sea-level rise and land subsidence would cause the highest changes in
   flood hazard and damage to rice crop, followed by hydropower and climate
   change impacts. Expansion of high-dyke areas in two northernmost delta
   provinces (An Giang and Dong Thap) would have the smallest impact. The
   combination of all modelled drivers is projected to increase delta
   inundation extent by 20\%, accompanied with prolonging submergence of
   1-2 months, and 2-3 times increase in annual flood damage to rice crops
   in the flood-prone areas of the VMD. These findings of likely increasing
   risk of tidal induced flood hazard and damage call for well-planned
   adaptation and mitigation measures, both structural and non-structural.

Title = {Potential impacts of cool and green roofs on temperature-related
   mortality in the Greater Boston region},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many cities are developing mitigation plans in an effort to reduce the
   population health impacts from expected future increases in the
   frequency and intensity of heat waves. To inform heat mitigation and
   adaptation planning, information is needed on the extent to which
   available mitigation strategies, such as reflective and green roofs,
   could result in significant reductions in heat exposure. Using the
   Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we analysed the impact of
   green and cool (reflective) roofs on the urban heat island (UHI) and
   temperature-related deaths in the Greater Boston area (GBA) and New
   England area (NEA) in summer and winter. In the GBA, green and cool
   roofs reduced summertime population-weighted temperature by 0.35 degrees
   C and 0.40 degrees C, respectively. In winter, green roofs did not
   affect temperature, whereas cool roofs caused a temperature reduction of
   0.40 degrees C. In the NEA, the cooler summers induced by green and cool
   roofs were estimated to reduce the heat-related mortality rates by
   0.21\% and 0.17\%, respectively, compared to baseline. Cool-roof-induced
   temperature reduction in winter could increase the cold-related
   mortality rate by 0.096\% compared to baseline. These results suggest
   that both green and cool roofing strategies have the potential to reduce
   the impact of heat on premature deaths. Additionally, the differing
   effects in winter suggest the need for a careful consideration of health
   trade-offs in choosing heat island mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Untapped Potential of Citizen Science in Mexican Small-Scale Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Citizen science is a rapidly growing field with well-designed and run
   citizen science projects providing substantial benefits for conservation
   and management. Marine citizen science presents a unique set of
   challenges and lags behind terrestrial citizen science, but also
   provides significant opportunities to work in data-poor fisheries. This
   paper analyses case studies of citizen science projects developed in
   collaboration with small-scale fishing communities in Mexico's Pacific
   Ocean, Gulf of California and Caribbean Sea. The design and performance
   of these projects were evaluated against the previously published Ten
   Principles of Citizen Science, and Scientific Stages of Inquiry. Our
   results suggest that fisheries monitoring, submarine monitoring of no
   take zones, oceanographic monitoring, and the use of species
   identification apps by fishers meet the requirements of the published
   guidelines and are effective tools for involving the small-scale fishing
   community in science. Translating effective citizen science projects in
   to effective fishery management, however, is still at an early stage.
   Whilst citizen science data have been used locally by communities to
   adapt fishing practices, calculate recommendations for total allowable
   catches, establish and evaluate no take zones and detect range
   extensions of species affected by climate change, challenges remain
   regarding how to garner official recognition for the data, incorporate
   these growing sources of data into national policy, and use the data for
   adaptive management regimes at the national level.},

Abstract = {Alien microbes, fungi, plants and animals occur on most of the
   sub-Antarctic islands and some parts of the Antarctic continent. These
   have arrived over approximately the last two centuries, coincident with
   human activity in the region. Introduction routes have varied, but are
   largely associated with movement of people and cargo in connection with
   industrial, national scientific program and tourist operations. The
   large majority of aliens are European in origin. They have both direct
   and indirect impacts on the functioning of species-poor Antarctic
   ecosystems, in particular including substantial loss of local
   biodiversity and changes to ecosystem processes. With rapid climate
   change occurring in some parts of Antarctica, elevated numbers of
   introductions and enhanced success of colonization by aliens are likely,
   with consequent increases in impacts on ecosystems. Mitigation measures
   that will substantially reduce the risk of introductions to Antarctica
   and the sub-Antarctic must focus on reducing propagule loads on humans,
   and their food, cargo, and transport vessels.},

Abstract = {For too long, implicit acceptance of and assumptions about colonial
   property rights have directed the flow of adaptation policy pathways.
   Though there is increasing recognition of the challenges that flow from
   private property rights for effective, long term adaptation planning,
   there is yet to be sustained and systematic attention to how property
   rights act as a mechanism that entrenches maladaptive tendencies by
   further embedding path dependency. This is complicated by law, which on
   the one hand is thought of as a vehicle to help institutionalise
   adaptative capacity, but on the other embodies and amplifies property
   rights. Property discourses are embedding a dominant property rights
   path dependency for coastal climate adaptation. This path dependency
   entrenches an incremental approach to coastal governance, with normative
   ideas on private property rights and the path de-pendencies they create,
   underpinning managed retreat theory and action. Lessons from case
   studies in coastal locations in Australia provide important insights
   into future behaviours of property owners. These insights are useful as
   coastal management strategies seek to embrace climate change adaptation,
   and as the financial sector reassesses climate risk exposure.},

Title = {The Impact of Albedo Increase to Mitigate the Urban Heat Island in Terni
   (Italy) Using the WRF Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The impacts of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon on energy
   consumption, air quality, and human health have been widely studied and
   described. Mitigation strategies have been developed to fight the UHI
   and its detrimental consequences. A potential countermeasure is the
   increase of urban albedo by using cool materials. Cool materials are
   highly reflective materials that can maintain lower surface temperatures
   and thus can present an effective solution to mitigate the UHI. Terni's
   proven record of high temperatures along with related environmental and
   comfort issues in its urban areas have reflected the local consequences
   of global warming. On the other hand, it promoted integrated actions by
   the government and research institutes to investigate solutions to
   mitigate the UHI effects. In this study, the main goal is to investigate
   the effectiveness of albedo increase as a strategy to tackle the UHI, by
   using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model to
   simulate the urban climate of Terni (Italy). Three different scenarios
   through a summer heat wave in the summer of 2015 are analyzed. The Base
   Scenario, which simulates the actual conditions of the urban area, is
   the control case. In the Albedo Scenario (ALB Scenario), the albedo of
   the roof, walls and road of the whole urban area is increased. In the
   Albedo-Industrial Scenario (ALB-IND Scenario), the albedo of the roof,
   walls and road of the area occupied by the main industrial site of
   Terni, located in close proximity to the city center, is increased. The
   simulation results show that the UHI is decreased up to 2 degrees C both
   at daytime and at nighttime in the ALB and in ALB-IND Scenarios. Peak
   temperatures in the urban area can be decreased by 1 degrees C at
   daytime, and by about 2 degrees C at nighttime. Albedo increase in the
   area of interest might thus represent an opportunity to decrease the UHI
   effect and its consequences.},

Abstract = {Coastal shoreline forests are vulnerable to seawater exposure, the
   impacts of which will increase due to sea-level rise, but the long-term
   adaptation strategies and vulnerability of coastal forests are not well
   understood. We used whole-tree transpiration, leaf water potential,
   tree-ring width, and tree-ring delta C-13 (a proxy for intrinsic water
   use efficiency, iWUE) to examine the long-term adaptation strategies of
   red maple (Acer rubrum) trees at the coastal interface (i.e., shoreline)
   and nearby upland in Maryland, USA. Red maple trees that grew along the
   shoreline and were exposed to slightly saline water (up to two PSU) had
   higher transpiration rates than those growing in the nearby upland
   forest during a wet year, but these differences disappeared during a
   normal precipitation year. Shoreline trees grew more slowly than upland
   trees over the last four decades, but these growth differences have
   disappeared in the last six years. Shoreline and upland red maple trees
   had similar variation in iWUE, indicating that higher transpiration
   rates of the seawater-exposed trees did not translate into differences
   in water use efficiency. There were no differences in predawn and midday
   water potential between upland and shoreline trees, suggesting no
   additional water stress occurs in shoreline trees. These findings
   indicate that mature red maple in our coastal study site maintains gas
   exchange and growth at a consistent or homeostatic level under slight
   soil salinity.},

Title = {Projections of the future occurrence, distribution, and seasonality of
   three Vibrio species in the Chesapeake Bay under a high-emission climate
   change scenario},
Journal = {GEOHEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {1},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Illness caused by pathogenic strains of Vibrio bacteria incurs
   significant economic and health care costs in many areas around the
   world. In the Chesapeake Bay, the two most problematic species are V.
   vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus, which cause infection both from
   exposure to contaminated water and consumption of contaminated seafood.
   We used existing Vibrio habitat models, four global climate models, and
   a recently developed statistical downscaling framework to project the
   spatiotemporal probability of occurrence of V. vulnificus and V.
   cholerae in the estuarine environment, and the mean concentration of V.
   parahaemolyticus in oysters in the Chesapeake Bay by the end of the 21st
   century. Results showed substantial future increases in season length
   and spatial habitat for V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus, while
   projected increase in V. cholerae habitat was less marked and more
   spatially heterogeneous. Our findings underscore the need for spatially
   variable inputs into models of climate impacts on Vibrios in estuarine
   environments. Overall, economic costs associated with Vibrios in the
   Chesapeake Bay, such as incidence of illness and management measures on
   the shellfish industry, may increase under climate change, with
   implications for recreational and commercial uses of the ecosystem.
   Plain Language Summary Bacteria in the genus Vibrio can cause illness to
   people through eating of contaminated seafood, or exposure to
   contaminated water. Vibrios occur naturally in the Chesapeake Bay, but
   their abundance varies with water temperature, salinity and other
   factors. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on the
   future abundance of three Vibrios in the Chesapeake Bay using outputs
   from four different climate models. We show that abundance of Vibrios in
   the water, and in oysters, may increase as temperatures warm. In
   addition, the seasons of highest risk may last longer, compared to the
   present day. This suggests that Vibrio-related illnesses in the
   Chesapeake Bay region may increase in the future, unless current
   management measures can adapt.},

Title = {Spatially explicit risk approach for multi-hazard assessment and
   management in marine environment: The case study of the Adriatic Sea},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {618},
Pages = {1008-1023},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {In the last few decades the health of marine ecosystems has been
   progressively endangered by the anthropogenic presence. Natural and
   human-made pressures, as well as climate change effects, are posing
   increasing threats on marine areas, triggering alteration of biological,
   chemical and physical processes. Planning of marine areas has become a
   challenge for decision makers involved in the design of sustainable
   management options. In order to address threats posed by climate drivers
   in combination with local to regional anthropogenic pressures affecting
   marine ecosystems and activities, a multi-hazard assessment methodology
   was developed and applied to the Adriatic Sea for the reference scenario
   2000-2015. Through a four-stages process based on the consecutive
   analysis of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk the methodology
   allows a semi-quantitative evaluation of the relative risk from
   anthropogenic and natural sources to multiple endpoints, thus supporting
   the identification and ranking of areas and targets more likely to be at
   risk. Resulting output showed that the higher relative hazard scores are
   linked to exogenic pressures (e.g. sea surface temperature variation)
   while the lower ones resulted from endogenic and more localized
   stressors (e.g. abrasion, nutrient input). Relatively very high scores
   were observed for vulnerability over the whole case study for almost all
   the considered pressures, showing seagrasses meadows, maerl and coral
   beds as the most susceptible targets. The approach outlined in this
   study provides planners and decision makers a quick-screening tool to
   evaluate progress towards attaining a good environmental status and to
   identify marine areas where management actions and adaptation strategies
   would be best targeted. Moreover, by focusing on risks induced by
   land-based drivers, resulting output can support the design of
   infrastructures for reducing pressures on the sea, contributing to
   improve the land-sea interface management. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Ecological restoration is a tool for climate change mitigation and
   adaptation, and yet its outcomes are susceptible themselves to climate
   change impacts. Drawing on the literature documenting this in theory and
   practice, we present a comprehensive overview of climate change risks
   and considerations across the whole life cycle of a restoration
   initiative. The resulting framework identified seven areas of
   restoration design and implementation in which climate change is
   important to address: setting restoration objectives, selecting sites
   and managing connectivity, choosing target species and ecosystems,
   managing key ecosystem interactions and micro-climates, identifying and
   mitigating site-level climate change risks, aligning the project with
   long-term policies, and designing a monitoring framework that enables
   adaptive management. A scan of restoration projects focussing on two
   regions - Brazil and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations, ASEAN - revealed limited inclusion of these considerations in
   practice, with less than 5\% of the projects evidently addressing at
   least one of the seven areas. We discuss two projects showing good
   practice in climate resilient restoration: restoration of Atlantic
   forest in Brazil that plans for climate change in connectivity and
   hydrological management, species selection, and policy alignment, and
   crayweed underwater forest restoration in Sydney, Australia, whose
   careful attention to species provenance, genotype measurement and
   monitoring provided a ``future-proofing{''} approach to restoration
   success in the long term. Building on such examples, our framework can
   be used as a tool to support global restoration targets and the UN
   Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 through more climate resilient
   restoration. (C) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e

Year = {2002},
Volume = {2},

Pages = {367-377},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Management of trees in agroecosystems such as agroforestry,
   ethnoforests, and trees outside forests can mitigate green house gas
   (GHG) emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Agroforestry systems are a
   better climate change mitigation option than oceanic, and other
   terrestrial options because of the secondary environmental benefits such
   as helping to attain food security and secure land tenure in developing
   countries, increasing farm income, restoring and maintaining
   above-ground and below-ground biodiversity, corridors between protected
   forests, as CH4 sinks, maintaining watershed hydrology, and soil
   conservation. Agroforestry also mitigates the demand for wood and
   reduces pressure on natural forests. Promoting woodcarving industry
   facilitates long-term locking-up of carbon in carved wood and new
   sequestration through intensified tree growing. By making use of local
   knowledge, equity, livelihood security, trade and industry, can be
   supported. There is need to support development of suitable policies,
   assisted by robust country-wide scientific studies aimed at better
   understanding the potential of agroforestry and ethnoforestry for
   climate change mitigation and human well-being. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {Typhoon storm surge disasters have garnered much attention because of
   their catastrophic damages. We investigated spatiotemporal patterns of
   typhoon storm surge disasters based on their tropical cyclone track
   clusters to support disaster mitigation in China. We aggregated 172
   typhoon storm surge disasters in the entire cluster. Then, we used the
   extended Finite-Mixture-Model to categorize these 172 disasters into
   three clusters according to their track clusters (westward, northward,
   and westward shift at the coastline). In general, not all temporal
   distributions of the frequency and damage showed significant trends in
   the entire cluster and three clusters from 1983-2018. Between 1983-2000
   and 2001-2018, the average annual frequency increased, and average
   annual direct economic loss and average annual fatalities decreased in
   the entire cluster. Although most temporal patterns in the three
   clusters were similar to those in the entire cluster, a positive growth
   ratio in the average annual direct economic loss was apparent between
   1983-2000 and 2001-2018 in Cluster 3. For spatial patterns, southern and
   eastern regions were more affected by typhoon storm surge disasters than
   northern regions. In northern regions, Cluster 2 recorded the most
   disaster occurrences, direct economic losses, and fatalities. Track
   characteristics and mitigation measures were introduced to help
   understand disaster spatiotemporal patterns in the entire cluster and
   three clusters.},

Title = {Structured decision analysis informed by traditional ecological
   knowledge as a tool to strengthen subsistence systems in a changing
   Arctic},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Climate change is impacting the subsistence livelihoods of many
   indigenous communities in the Arctic. We describe how structured
   decision analysis (SDA), informed by traditional ecological knowledge,
   can be used to understand the mechanisms of how climate change
   influences subsistence species and their harvest, and to build upon
   existing adaptive strategies and decision-making processes. In the
   Inupiat community of Wainwright, Alaska, we test SDA as a potential
   framework by which vulnerabilities of subsistence systems can be
   identified and climate change adaptations can be prioritized. Over the
   course of five workshops, participants identified issues of concern,
   assessed the benefits and trade-offs of different strategies to enhance
   the safety of subsistence activities, identified factors influencing key
   subsistence species and their accessibility, and assessed the dependence
   of animals and their harvest on sea ice. Furthermore, we asked workshop
   participants to assess whether subsistence resources have increased,
   decreased, or remained stable over the past decade. Declining caribou
   populations and unsafe ice conditions for hunters were of particular
   concern in Wainwright. Participants identified high priority safety
   strategies such as a new docking facility, safety workshops, a hunter
   meeting place, and search and rescue boats. Because of its coastal
   location on a lagoon at the mouth of a river, Wainwright has a highly
   diverse subsistence system that may in part buffer the negative effects
   of climate change. Furthermore, most species or groups harvested in
   Wainwright were assessed as stable or increasing. Nevertheless, of the
   five most important subsistence species in Wainwright, one experienced
   recent population declines (caribou) and the harvest of three others
   depends on the presence of thick, reliable shorefast ice. We propose
   that SDA can be a useful tool to assess the vulnerability of subsistence
   systems to climate change, and can be used to prioritize strategies to
   adapt to climate change.},

Abstract = {Most of the focus in recent years on the potential impacts of rising
   levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere linked to anthropogenic
   activities has been on the ramifications of atmospheric warming for
   ecosystems and human institutions. However, there is growing evidence
   that the gravest peril for ocean species may be acidification of the
   world's oceans as a consequence of the influx of carbon dioxide absorbed
   in oceans as carbon dioxide emissions. This chapter assesses the likely
   impacts of ocean acidification on marine species, including calcifying
   species and fish. Ocean acidification may dictate changes in
   institutional strategies in the context of the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol and may spur
   litigation in other international flora. However, a critical
   foundational agenda is a robust research program to comprehensively
   assess potential ocean acidification impacts and adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Change of Global Ocean Temperature and Decadal Variability under 1.5
   degrees C Warming in FOAM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration is regarded as the dominant
   reason for observed warming since the mid-20th century. Based on the
   Paris Agreement target, this research designs three conceptual pathways
   to achieve the warming target of 1.5 degrees C above the pre-industrial
   level by using the Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model. The three different
   scenarios contain one equilibrium experiment (equilibrium, EQ) and two
   transient experiments (never-exceed pathway, NE; overshoot pathway, OS).
   Then, we choose a ten year average that achieves 1.5 degrees C warming
   to calculate the climatology of the warming situation. Since OS achieves
   1.5 degrees C twice, we obtain four warming situations to explore the
   response of ocean temperature. In 2100, the global ocean temperature
   increases over the global region, except the surface of the Southern
   Ocean. The difference in heat content mainly depends on the cumulative
   force of CO2 concentration. It is worth pointing out that during the
   increase in warming, the ocean surface temperature and heat content
   start to respond in different hemispheres. The weakening of decadal
   variability in the North Pacific and North Atlantic is robust in all
   three scenarios. However, there is a tremendous growth in the low-pass
   ocean surface temperature standard deviation in the Southern Ocean in
   EQ, which is different to NE and OS, and causes the increase in global
   mean total standard deviation. The shortening of decadal variability can
   only be seen from the EQ power spectrum, while NE and OS have similar
   power spectra with pre-industrial runs. It suggests that all previous
   studies that use equilibrium experiments data may have overestimated the
   shortening of decadal variability under global warming.},

   trajectories on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 26},
Abstract = {Managers need information about the vulnerability of historical plant
   communities, and their potential future conditions, to respond
   appropriately to landscape change driven by global climate change. We
   model the climate envelopes of plant communities on the Kenai Peninsula
   in Southcentral Alaska and forecast to 2020, 2050, and 2080. We assess 6
   model outputs representing downscaled climate data from 3 global climate
   model outputs and 2 representative concentration pathways. We use two
   lines of evidence, model convergence and empirically measured rates of
   change, to identify the following plausible ecological trajectories for
   the peninsula: (1.) alpine tundra and sub-alpine shrub decrease, (2.)
   perennial snow and ice decrease, (3.) forests remain on the Kenai
   Lowlands, (4.) the contiguous white-Lutz-Sitka spruce complex declines,
   and (5.) mixed conifer afforestation occurs along the Gulf of Alaska
   coast. We suggest that converging models in the context of other lines
   of evidence is a viable approach to increase certainty for adaptation
   planning. Extremely dynamic areas with multiple outcomes (i.e.,
   disagreement) among models represent ecological risk, but may also
   represent opportunities for facilitated adaptation and other managerial
   approaches to help tip the balance one way or another. By reducing
   uncertainty, this eclectic approach can be used to inform expectations
   about the future.},

Title = {Exploring the benefits and dis-benefits of climate migration as an
   adaptive strategy along the rural-peri-urban continuum in Namibia},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The scale of climate migration across the Global South is expected to
   increase during this century. By 2050, millions of Africans are likely
   to consider, or be pushed into, migration because of climate hazards
   contributing to agricultural disruption, water and food scarcity,
   desertification, flooding, drought, coastal erosion, and heat waves.
   However, the migration-climate nexus is complex, as is the question of
   whether migration can be considered a climate change adaptation strategy
   across both the rural and urban space. Combining data from household
   surveys, key informant interviews, and secondary sources related to
   regional disaster, demographic, resource, and economic trends between
   1990 and 2020 from north central and central dryland Namibia, we
   investigate (i) human migration flows and the influence of climate
   hazards on these flows and (ii) the benefits and dis-benefits of
   migration in supporting climate change adaptation, from the perspective
   of migrants (personal factors and intervening obstacles), areas of
   origin, and areas of destination. Our analysis suggests an increase in
   climate-related push factors that could be driving rural out-migration
   from the north central region to peri-urban settlements in the central
   region of the country. While push factors play a role in rural-urban
   migration, there are also several pull factors (many of which have been
   long-term drivers of urban migration) such as perceived higher wages,
   diversity of livelihoods, water, health and energy provisioning,
   remittances, better education opportunities, and the exchange of
   non-marketed products. Migration to peri-urban settlements can reduce
   some risks (e.g. loss of crops and income due to climate extremes) but
   amplify others (e.g. heat stress and insecure land tenure). Adaptation
   at both ends of the rural-urban continuum is supported by deeply
   embedded linkages in a model of circular rural-urban-rural migration and
   interdependencies. Results empirically inform current and future policy
   debates around climate mobilities in Namibia, with wider implications

Title = {Monitoring the resilience of a no-take marine reserve to a range
   extending species using benthic imagery},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Global climate change is driving the redistribution of marine species
   and thereby potentially restructuring endemic communities. Understanding
   how localised conservation measures such as protection from additional
   human pressures can confer resilience to ecosystems is therefore an
   important area of research. Here, we examine the resilience of a no-take
   marine reserve (NTR) to the establishment of urchin barrens habitat. The
   barrens habitat is created through overgrazing of kelp by an invading
   urchin species that is expanding its range within a hotspot of rapid
   climate change. In our study region, a multi-year monitoring program
   provides a unique time-series of benthic imagery collected by an
   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) within an NTR and nearby reference
   areas. We use a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal modelling approach
   to estimate whether the NTR is associated with reduced formation of
   urchin barrens, and thereby enhances local resilience. Our approach
   controls for the important environmental covariates of depth and habitat
   complexity (quantified as rugosity derived from multibeam sonar
   mapping), as well as spatial and temporal dependence. We find evidence
   for the NTR conferring resilience with a strong reserve effect that
   suggests improved resistance to the establishment of barrens. However,
   we find a concerning and consistent trajectory of increasing barrens
   cover in both the reference areas and the NTR, with the odds of barrens
   increasing by approximately 32\% per year. Thus, whereas the reserve is
   demonstrating resilience to the initial establishment of barrens, there
   is currently no evidence of recovery once barrens are established. We
   also find that depth and rugosity covariates derived from multibeam
   mapping provide useful predictors for barrens occurrence. These results
   have important management implications as they demonstrate: (i) the
   importance of monitoring programs to inform adaptive management; (ii)
   that NTRs provide a potential local conservation management tool under
   climate change impacts, and (iii) that technologies such as AUVs and
   multibeam mapping can be harnessed to inform regional decision-making.
   Continuation of the current monitoring program is required to assess
   whether the NTR can provide long term protection from a phase shift that
   replaces kelp with urchin barrens.},

Abstract = {Conceptual ecological models, as used in the Everglades restoration
   program, are non-quantitative planning tools that identify the major
   anthropogenic drivers and stressors on natural systems, the ecological
   effects of these stressors, and the best biological attributes or
   indicators of these ecological responses. Conceptual ecological models
   can be used with any ecological restoration and conservation program and
   can become the primary communication, planning, and assessment link
   among scientists and policy-makers. A set of conceptual ecological
   models has been developed for South Florida restoration as a framework
   for supporting integration of science and policy and are key components
   of an Adaptive Management Program being developed for the Comprehensive
   Everglades Restoration Plan. Other large-scale restoration programs also
   use conceptual ecological models. This special edition of Wetlands
   presents 11 South Florida regional models, one total system model for
   South Florida, and one international regional model. This paper provides
   an overview of these models and defines conceptual ecological model
   components. It also provides a brief history of South Florida's natural
   systems and summarizes components common to many of the regional models.},

   Modeling and the Design of Adaptation Interventions},

Abstract = {The Caribbean is affected by climate change due to an increase in the
   variability, frequency, and intensity of extreme weather events. When
   coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and
   loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In
   order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and
   local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and
   climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the
   critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review
   the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically
   Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution
   and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of
   the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a
   typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be
   more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property
   flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental
   and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and
   ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We
   emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately
   scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation
   planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal
   zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations,
   project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in
   adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective
   adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level
   rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that
   less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three
   times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models,
   indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation
   mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions.
   However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind,
   cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of
   high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly
   saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation.},

Abstract = {The most populated state in the United States, California, is projected
   to add millions of new inhabitants through the end of the current
   century, requiring considerable landscape conversion to the built
   environment. A suite of continuous multiyear, medium-range resolution
   (20-km grid spacing), ensemble-based simulations is examined to assess
   urban expansion climate effects on California in 2100, and potential
   strategies to alleviate them. Summertime {[}June-August (JJA)] warming
   due to urban expansion of 1 degrees-2 degrees C is greater relative to
   any other season, and is completely offset by a range of adaptation
   strategies: green roofs (highly transpiring), cool roofs (highly
   reflective), and hybrid roofs (with combined biophysical properties of
   green and cool roofs). After offsetting of urban-induced warming, cool
   and hybrid roofs lead to a further 1 degrees-2 degrees C reduction in
   JJA 2-m temperature, highlighting enhanced efficacy of these adaptation
   strategies. Guided by medium-range-resolution results, additional
   high-resolution (2-km grid spacing) experiments are conducted for a
   subset of the JJA periods conducted on a coarser scale. Urban-induced 1
   degrees-2 degrees C warming (local maximum warming exceeds 4 degrees C)
   is simulated, and is offset by cool and green roof deployment. In
   agreement with coarser-resolution results, maximum near-surface cooling
   is greater for cool roofs relative to green roofs. Reduced daytime
   warming associated with both cool and green roofs also modifies the
   convective mixed layer, reducing turbulent kinetic energy and planetary
   boundary layer height, although this impact is less for green roofs than
   for cool roofs. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of
   future urban expansion in California and illustrate climatic
   consequences with implications for regional air quality.},

Abstract = {Relocation is increasingly being considered a viable adaptation strategy
   in some coastal locations. Even though recent coastal disasters and a
   higher awareness of sea level rise have accentuated the importance of
   relocation, this is not a new strategy and has been applied as an
   effective hazard mitigation measure over the last three decades. The
   main objective of this paper is to evaluate the acquisition and
   relocation projects funded between 1989 and 2016 as a part of the Hazard
   Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and determine how the allocations for
   these projects evolved over time. A trend analysis was applied to assess
   how the number and the dollar amount of approved acquisition/relocation
   projects differ between coastal and inland counties, and within these
   categories, between rural and urban districts. Our findings show that
   inland counties had a significantly higher number of projects in any
   given year; however, average cost per coastal project has been
   continually increasing while that of inland projects decreased over the
   study period. Further, there is no marked difference between the number
   of and total amount spent on inland rural versus urban projects, while
   those in the coastal zone significantly differ in all categories between
   rural and urban counties.},

Abstract = {Predicting how vegetation may change in response to an increasingly
   variable climate is difficult, but the analysis of observed responses to
   past climatic oscillations can inform the forecasting process. The
   consequences of multiple extreme events were recorded (1978-1998) for a
   California salt marsh. Ultimately, after less-extreme decadal weather
   patterns were preceded by more-extreme ones resulting from the Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation, six types of climate-change-related effects on
   vegetation became apparent. Among the identified effect types in this
   system, ``sequential{''} (or event-order-dependent) effects were the
   most severe with regard to abrupt biodiversity losses. Similar outcomes
   could be applied to other ecosystems subjected to variable conditions.
   Managers and restoration ecologists need to anticipate the many ways in
   which extreme events can affect vegetation and use this knowledge to
   build resilience into restoration targets and plantings. A national
   program of adaptive restoration could first be applied in downstream
   wetlands, where the cumulative effects of flooding and sedimentation
   will cause vegetation to respond rapidly, and where adaptive approaches
   (eg futuristic assemblages) could be tested in large field experiments.},

Title = {Assessing storm surge risk under future sea-level rise scenarios: a case
   study in the North Adriatic coast},

Abstract = {Low-lying coastal areas are often prone to storm surge flooding that can
   render severe damages to properties, destruction of habitats, threat to
   human safety and the environment. The impacts of coastal flooding are
   also expected to increase in the future as a consequence of global
   climate change and sea-level rise. This paper presents a comprehensive
   assessment of the potential risks raised by storm surge and sea-level
   rise on multiple coastal targets (i.e., population, buildings,
   infrastructures, agriculture, natural and semi-natural environments and
   cultural heritage) in the Northern Adriatic coast in Italy. Through the
   assessment of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, a Regional Risk
   Assessment (RRA) methodology allowed identifying and prioritizing
   hot-spot risk areas and targets requiring particular attention for the
   definition of adaptation strategies. Hazard scenarios were based on the
   analysis of tide gauge data (elaborated with the Joint Probability
   Method) and of different sea-level rise projections for the year 2100.
   Geographical-information analysis was then used to characterize
   vulnerability patterns of exposed natural and human systems and to make
   a spatial ranking of risks. Maps produced for the worst scenario showed
   that beaches are the target at higher risk (with more than 90\% of the
   surface in the higher relative risk class) due to the low elevation and
   high proximity to the coastline. Also cultural heritage (i.e., villas,
   historical buildings and roads) and wetlands are highly threatened by
   storm surge flooding. The relative risks will be lower (i.e., between
   25\% and 40\% of their surface/length in the higher relative risk class)
   for most of the other receptors (i.e., local roads, railways, natural
   and semi-natural environments and agricultural areas), including
   population and buildings that are mostly classified in lower risk
   classes. The overall results of the assessment, including maps and risk
   metrics, can be useful to rise the attention of coastal managers about
   the need to adapt to climate change, developing climate-proof policies
   and programs for the sustainable management of coastal zones.},

Abstract = {Organisations and governments around the globe are developing
   methodologies to cope with increasing numbers of disasters and climate
   change as well as implementing risk reducing measures across diverse
   socio-economic and environmental sectors and scales. What is often
   overlooked and certainly required for comprehensive planning and
   programming are better tools and approaches that include ecosystems in
   the equations. Collectively, these mechanisms can help to enhance
   societies' abilities to capture the protective benefits of ecosystems
   for communities facing disaster and climate risks. As illustrated within
   this chapter, decision support tools and approaches are clearly
   improving rapidly. Despite these advancements, factors such as
   resistance to change, the cautious approach by development agencies,
   governance structure and overlapping jurisdictions, funding, and limited
   community engagement remain, in many cases, pre-requisites to successful
   implementation of ecosystem-based solutions. Herein we provide case
   studies, lessons learned and recommendations from applications of
   decision support tools and approaches that advance better risk
   assessments and implementation of ecosystem-based solutions. The case
   studies featured in this chapter illustrate opportunities that have been
   enhanced with cutting edge tools, social media and crowdsourcing,
   cost/benefit comparisons, and scenario planning mechanisms. Undoubtedly,
   due to the large areas and extent of exposure to natural hazards,
   ecosystems will increasingly become a critical part of societies'
   overall responses to equitably solve issues of disaster risk reduction
   and climate change adaptation.},

   recent combinations of climatic presses and pulses have led to
   population collapses, loss of relictual communities and shifts into
   novel ecosystems. These changes have been sudden and unpredictable, and

   illuminate biological responses to climate change, grounds debate about
   suitable management interventions and highlights possible consequences

Abstract = {The complex and dynamic nature of tourism, and the need to address
   triple bottom line sustainability, has encouraged a search for adaptive
   tourism management approaches based on organisational learning. In this
   paper, the authors discuss a practical approach for the implementation
   of a Learning Tourism Destination (LTD), a new concept derived from the
   theory of learning organisations. Preliminary results from a case study
   undertaken at the Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia are discussed. The
   conducted surveys indicate that the LTD forms a useful framework for
   fostering consensus building, dialogue and collective learning processes
   among stakeholders. The proposed approach has the potential to improve
   decision-making within the concept of sustainable tourism development by
   facilitating participative planning processes. The overall strategy of
   this paper is to explore the practicalities of the LTD implementation
   process, and to spark further conceptual and practical debate, based on
   the analysis of the Ningaloo case study. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley

Abstract = {The Ba River catchment and delta on the island of Viti Levu, Fiji,
   supports a wealth of livelihoods and is populated by diverse communities
   who are living with an increased frequency and intensity of
   hydro-meteorological hazards (floods, cyclones and droughts).
   Participatory mapping as part of focus group discussions is a tool that
   can be used to elucidate communities' understanding of the differing
   impacts of multiple hazards, as well as the strategies used to prepare
   and respond to different hazards. In this chapter, the authors present
   the results of qualitative research undertaken with members of three
   communities along the Ba River, from the Nausori highlands to the
   coastal mangroves, with a particular focus on recent floods (2009, 2012)
   and Tropical Cyclone Winston (2016). The communities draw on a wide
   range of livelihood strategies from fishing and agriculture to tourism
   and outside work. Natural hazard events vary in their impact on these
   livelihood strategies across the landscape and seascape, so that
   community members can adjust their activities accordingly. The temporal
   `signatures' of ongoing impacts are also variable across communities and
   resources. The results suggest that taking a broad, landscape (and
   seascape) approach to understanding how communities draw livelihoods is
   valuable in informing effective and inclusive adaptation strategies for
   environmental change. Furthermore, documenting how the landscape is used
   in a mapped output may be a valuable tool for future social impact
   assessment for resource extraction activities.},

Title = {An overview of carbon sequestration of green roofs in urban areas},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In urban areas, one way of mitigating the adverse effects of air
   pollution is the sustainable rooftop practice known as green roofs. How
   green roofs can help reduce carbon emissions in urban areas, directly
   and indirectly, is the focus of this review, which draws on recently
   published studies. The direct impact of green roofs on carbon
   sequestration involves vegetation and soil media, which can capture and
   store air pollutants on a building scale. The indirect impact includes
   the long-term green roof effect, which can include reducing building
   energy consumption, leading to a reduction in fossil fuel consumption.
   Consequently, this process could reduce CO2 emissions around the globe.
   According to the literature analysis, the indirect long-term benefits
   help promote green roofs as a green practice around the world. It was
   found that vegetation and soil properties are the key factors affecting
   the performance of building energy consumption reduction and CO2
   sequestration. Stakeholders and the public are encouraged, based on the
   literature review results, to adopt green roofs in building construction
   projects as a climate mitigation strategy.},

Abstract = {UNESCO's 207 natural heritage World Heritage Properties are at risk from
   climate change, but risk varies widely among properties. I offer a
   global model based on multi-model general circulation model (GCM)
   ensembles, vulnerability and Human Influence (HII), producing the World
   Heritage Vulnerability Index (WHVI), a measure of relative risk among
   properties. Nineteen properties are most at risk (i.e. WHVI >= mean + 1
   SD). Those include islands (i.e. Vallee de Mai, Aldabra, East Rennell,
   Teide, Laurisilva of Maderia, Isole Eloie, Pitons Management Area, Morne
   Trois Pitons and Galapagos Islands), coastal properties (i.e.
   Everglades, Desembarco del Granma, High Coast and Kvarken Archipelago,
   Do ana, Brazilian Atlantic Islands, Ichkeul and the Sunderbans) and
   mountainous properties (i.e. the Pyrenees Mont Perdu, Nanda Devi and the
   Valley of Flowers, and Mount Kinabalu). Three properties (i.e. Teide,
   Isole Eloie and the Pitons Management Area) are geologic, apparently
   relatively resistant to short-term climactic changes. The remaining 16
   are likely to respond to climactic changes in the next 40 years; those
   changes may threaten their World Heritage status. Those properties are
   where society could most effectively invest in adaptation. I identify
   adaptive strategies and next steps for proactive climate change
   adaptation in the 16 natural heritage properties on the World Heritage

Title = {Vulnerability Analysis to Maximize the Resilience of Power Systems
   Considering Demand Response and Distributed Generation},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Electric power systems are subject to failures, due to both deliberate
   and fortuitous events. This paper addresses the first case in which a
   disruptive agent aims at maximizing the damage to the network (expressed
   through the total cost of operation), while the system operator takes
   the necessary measures to mitigate the effects of this attack. The
   interaction between these two agents is modeled by means of a bi-level
   optimization problem. On one hand, the disruptive agent is positioned in
   the upper-level optimization problem and must decide which elements to
   render out of service (lines and generators), given a limited
   destructive budget. On the other hand, the system operator, located in a
   lower-level optimization problem, reacts to the attack by deploying
   mitigation measures in order to minimize cost overruns in system
   operation. Based on the aforementioned dynamic, this paper proposes a
   novel approach to maximize the resiliency of the power system under
   intentional attacks through the implementation of distributed energy
   resources (DERs), namely, distributed generation (DG) and demand
   response (DR). Three metrics are proposed to assess resilience by
   assigning DERs in islands generated by the destruction of lines and
   generators. The results obtained in a didactic 5-bus test system and the
   IEEE RTS-24 bus test system demonstrate the applicability and
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Abstract = {Climate change is projected to further increase heat waves in number,
   intensity and duration over most land areas in the twenty-first century.
   Among the urban population persons with migrant background are
   particularly considered to be at risk during heat waves due to the
   intersection of several risk factors: social status (poverty, manual
   labour), residential area (densely populated, disadvantaged urban areas,
   heat islands) and health condition. In this chapter we pledge for a
   differentiated approach in studying heat-related health outcomes and
   present first descriptive outcomes of two explorative case studies of
   multi-generation-families in Vienna, comparing a family with Turkish
   migrant background with a family without migrant background. The data
   consists of participant observation and in-depth interviews and has been
   generated in the course of the research project ``Vulnerability of and

Title = {Climate Change and Social Perception: A Case Study in Southern Italy},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The consequences of climate change can involve various ambits and be
   very severe. For this reason, the social perception of climate change is
   a fundamental issue since it can influence the decisions of the
   policymakers, by encouraging or discouraging political, economic and
   social actions. In this paper, a sample of 300 interviews, collected
   through a standardized questionnaire and carried out among two
   municipalities located in southern Italy, was exploited to investigate
   the perception of climate change. Specific issues, regarding perceptions
   about climate change, concerns about its impacts, level of information,
   behavior and actions, exposure to extreme natural events and trust, were
   addressed to give answers to the research questions: (i) Is climate
   change perceived by the population? (ii) What is the degree of the
   community resilience to extreme natural events and climate change? As
   the main findings, this survey highlighted that the spatio-temporal
   dimension affects population perception, suggesting that some issues,
   such as correct behavior towards the geosphere, the sustainability of
   anthropization processes, community resilience and disaster risk
   reduction policies, can be very central and useful to mitigate the
   effects of climate change in population and society. Moreover, climate
   change perception varies in relation to contextual factors, including
   media communication, socio-demographic characteristics of respondents,
   knowledge and education, economic and institutional factors, personal
   values and, finally, psychological factors and experience.},

   communities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {The current and projected impacts of climate change make understanding
   the environmental and social vulnerability of coastal communities and
   the planning of adaptations important international goals and national
   policy initiatives. Yet, coastal communities are concurrently
   experiencing numerous other social, political, economic, demographic and
   environmental changes or stressors that also need to be considered and
   planned for simultaneously to maintain social and environmental
   sustainability. There are a number of methods and processes that have
   been used to study vulnerability and identify adaptive response
   strategies. This paper describes the stages, methods and results of a
   modified community-based scenario planning process that was used for
   vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning within the context of
   multiple interacting stressors in two coastal fishing communities in
   Thailand. The four stages of community-based scenario planning included:
   (1) identifying the problem and purpose of scenario planning; (2)
   exploring the system and types of change; (3) generating possible future
   scenarios; and (4) proposing and prioritizing adaptations. Results
   revealed local perspectives on social and environmental change,
   participant visions for their local community and the environment, and
   potential actions that will help communities to adapt to the changes
   that are occurring. Community-based scenario planning proved to have
   significant potential as an anticipatory action research process for
   incorporating multiple stressors into vulnerability analysis and
   adaptation planning. This paper reflects on the process and outcomes to
   provide insights and suggest changes for future applications of
   community-based scenario planning that will lead to more effective
   learning, innovation and action in communities and related
   social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {In West Africa, coastal erosion remains a problem for the socio-economic
   development of the coastal zone. Case studies in Senegal and Benin
   indicate a strong intensification of coastal erosion, in relation to
   human influence, as shown by the analysis of shoreline change rates from
   satellite data. The ``Langue deBarbaric,{''} a sand spit bounding the
   mouth of the Senegal River delta in the Saint-Louis Region, Senegal, is
   relatively densely inhabited and developed. The spit was artificially
   breached in 2003 to alleviate potential river flooding that threatened
   the historical city of Saint-Louis. The analysis covers two periods: the
   pre-breach period (1984-2003) characterized by sectors alternating
   between erosion and accretion, and the post-breach period (2003-2016)
   indicating a generalization of the erosion process, with a noteworthy
   average rate of -3.72 m/yr affecting the entire spit, strongly
   destabilized by the artificial breach. In Benin, shoreline evolution is
   equally affected by human interventions. Following the construction of
   the Nangbeto Dam on the Mono River, the ``Bouche du Roi,{''} outlet of
   this river, has been characterized by marked instability, with an
   eastward migration exceeding 700 m/yr. Other human alterations of the
   coastal system include the installment of major seaports and groins that
   have resulted in some erosion downdrift near Cotonou. These examples
   highlight the limits of governance regarding the coast in West Africa,
   including adaptation strategies developed at regional, national and
   local levels, which often produce more setbacks than solutions. (C) 2017

Abstract = {In Sweden, adaptation to climate change has been addressed in connection
   with some strategic projects of national significance. Hydrological
   upgrading of Swedish dam safety assessments has been in the forefront.
   This has been followed by studies of risks in the expanding metropolitan
   areas of Stockholm and Gothenburg, where assumptions about hydrological
   changes have been combined with considerations about future changes in
   sea level. The two big lakes, Malaren and Vanern, and the River Gota alv
   have also been a focus. A key subject has been how to cope with the
   inevitable uncertainty, as illustrated by the range of results based on
   the set of regional climate scenarios available. The way forward has
   been close co-operation with stakeholders. In the case of dam safety,
   this was carried out in a joint committee including industry,
   responsible agencies and researchers. The dialogue within this committee
   may serve as a model for other sectors.},

Abstract = {The design of adaptive observations strategies must account for the
   particular properties of the data assimilation method. A new adjoint
   sensitivity approach to the targeted observations problem is proposed in
   the context of four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var).
   The method is based on a periodic update of the adjoint sensitivity
   field that takes into account the interaction between time distributed
   adaptive and routine observations. Information provided by all
   previously located observations is used to identify best locations for
   new targeted observations. Adaptive observations at distinct instants in
   time are selected in a sequential manner such that the method is only
   suboptimal. The selection algorithm proceeds backward in time and
   requires only one additional adjoint model integration in the
   assimilation window. Therefore, the method is very efficient and is
   suitable for practical applications. A comparative performance analysis
   is presented using the traditional adjoint sensitivity method as well as
   the total energy singular vectors technique as alternative adaptive
   strategies. Numerical experiments are performed in the twin experiments
   framework using a two-dimensional global shallow water model in
   spherical coordinates and an explicit Turkel-Zwas discretization scheme.
   Data from a NASA 500 mb analysis valid for 00Z 16 Mar 2001 6 h obtained
   with the GEOS-3 model was used to specify the geopotential height at the
   initial time and the initial velocities were obtained from a geostrophic
   balance. Numerical results show that the new adaptive observations
   approach is a promising method for targeted observations and its
   implementation is feasible for large scale atmospheric models.},

Abstract = {Climate change vulnerability is highly counter-productive for
   agriculture among the arid and semi-arid regions. The study constructs
   the agriculture vulnerability index for the semi-arid regions of
   Karnataka, a south Indian state. The state has faced frequent
   climate-related shocks in the last decade. The district-wise
   vulnerability index is estimated using longitudinal data considering
   exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the districts to climate
   variations as sub-indices. The results show that the districts in the
   north interior region of Karnataka are highly vulnerable to the climate
   change followed by the districts in the south interior and coastal
   regions. There is an urgent need to prioritize the most vulnerable
   districts while formulating the development policies to minimize the
   risk of climate change on agriculture. Specific technical knowledge and
   support need to be made available to the farmers for informative climate
   resilience action.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {76-84},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services such as protection from storms and erosion, tourism
   benefits, and climate adaptation and mitigation have been increasingly
   recognized as important considerations for environmental policymalcing.
   Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses,
   salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because
   they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon
   dioxide, referred to as ``coastal blue carbon{''}. Unfortunately,
   degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts
   contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and
   prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon.
   Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal
   ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to
   implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing
   mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya,
   India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon
   financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications
   of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects
   are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are
   examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or
   adaptation policies. This analysis can help to inform future project
   design considerations as well as policy opportunities. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Comparative Genomics of Exiguobacterium Reveals What Makes a
   Cosmopolitan Bacterium},
Journal = {MSYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although the strategies used by bacteria to adapt to specific
   environmental conditions are widely reported, fewer studies have
   addressed how microbes with a cosmopolitan distribution can survive in
   diverse ecosystems. Exiguobacterium is a versatile genus whose members
   are commonly found in various habitats. To better understand the
   mechanisms underlying the universality of Exiguobacterium, we collected
   105 strains from diverse environments and performed large-scale
   metabolic and adaptive ability tests. We found that most Exiguobacterium
   members have the capacity to survive under wide ranges of temperature,
   salinity, and pH. According to phylogenetic and average nucleotide
   identity analyses, we identified 27 putative species and classified two
   genetic groups: groups I and II. Comparative genomic analysis revealed
   that the Exiguobacterium members utilize a variety of complex
   polysaccharides and proteins to support survival in diverse environments
   and also employ a number of chaperonins and transporters for this
   purpose. We observed that the group I species can be found in more
   diverse terrestrial environments and have a larger genome size than the
   group II species. Our analyses revealed that the expansion of
   transporter families drove genomic expansion in group I strains, and we
   identified 25 transporter families, many of which are involved in the
   transport of important substrates and resistance to environmental
   stresses and are enriched in group I strains. This study provides
   important insights into both the overall general genetic basis for the
   cosmopolitan distribution of a bacterial genus and the evolutionary and
   adaptive strategies of Exiguobacterium.
   IMPORTANCE The wide distribution characteristics of Exiguobacterium make
   it a valuable model for studying the adaptive strategies of bacteria
   that can survive in multiple habitats. In this study, we reveal that
   members of the Exiguobacterium genus have a cosmopolitan distribution
   and share an extensive adaptability that enables them to survive in
   various environments. The capacities shared by Exiguobacterium members,
   such as their diverse means of polysaccharide utilization and
   environmental-stress resistance, provide an important basis for their
   cosmopolitan distribution. Furthermore, the selective expansion of
   transporter families has been a main driving force for genomic evolution
   in Exiguobacterium. Our findings improve our understanding of the
   adaptive and evolutionary mechanisms of cosmopolitan bacteria and the
   vital genomic traits that can facilitate niche adaptation.},

Title = {Toward Operationalizing Resilience Concepts in Australian Marine Sectors
   Coping with Climate Change},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {We seek to contribute to the scholarship on operationalizing resilience
   concepts via a working resilience indicator framework. Although it
   requires further refinement, this practical framework provides a useful
   baseline for generating awareness and understanding of the complexity
   and diversity of variables that impinge on resilience. It has potential
   value for the evaluation, benchmarking, monitoring, and reporting of
   marine system resilience. The necessity for such a framework is a
   consequence of the levels of complexity and uncertainty associated with
   climate change and other global change stressors in marine
   social-ecological systems, and the problems involved in assessing their
   resilience. There is a need for: (1) methodologies that bring together
   knowledge from diverse sources and disciplines to investigate the
   complexity and uncertainty of interactions between climate, ocean, and
   human systems and (2) frameworks to facilitate the evaluation and
   monitoring of the social-ecological resilience of marine-dependent
   sectors. Accordingly, our main objective is to demonstrate the virtues
   of combining a case study methodology with complex adaptive systems
   approaches as a means to improve understanding of the multifaceted
   dynamics of marine sectors experiencing climate change. The resilience
   indicator framework, the main product of the methodology, is developed
   using four case studies across key Australian marine biodiversity and
   resource sectors already experiencing impacts from climate and other
   global changes. It comprises a set of resilience dimensions with a
   candidate set of abstract and concrete resilience indicators. Its design
   ensures an integrated approach to resilience evaluation.},

   Inter-Provincial Perspective},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {China's marine fisheries are undergoing large-scale environmental
   changes associated with climate change, marine pollution, and
   overfishing. The assessment of marine fisheries vulnerability has become
   extremely necessary for fisheries management and sustainable
   development. However, studies on China's marine fisheries vulnerability
   remains sparse. This study aimed to provide an analysis of the
   inter-provincial level vulnerability of China's marine fisheries under
   multiple disturbances. The vulnerability measure was composed of
   exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indicators specific to
   marine fisheries based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) definitions. Results showed that Liaoning, Hebei, Fujian, and
   Hainan provinces appeared to be the most vulnerable; Shanghai appeared
   to be less vulnerable among China's 11 coastal provinces; and the key
   sources of vulnerability differed considerably among coastal regions.
   The high vulnerability regions could be divided into two different
   patterns according to the combination of exposure, sensitivity, and
   adaptive capacity, but they all had one thing in common: relatively low
   adaptive capacity. While some existing coercive measures to reduce
   dependence on fisheries were found to be helpful in China, the reality
   showed that appropriate adaptation measures such as improving
   fishermen's education level and increasing vocational training may be
   helpful in enhancing the existing policy effectiveness.},

Abstract = {It is possible that climate change may stimulate population movements as
   people turn to migration as one strategy of adaptation. This paper tries
   to examine possible migration flows which may occur within and between
   the countries of the south-west Pacific Ocean region as a result of
   climatic shifts over the next few decades. The focus includes the small
   island states of the region, Papua New Guinea, Australia and New
   Zealand. Some international case studies of how societies have responded
   to past climatic events are considered. It is argued that the small
   island states appear vulnerable to climate change, with low coral atolls
   being most at risk. Adverse impacts of climate change will put extra
   pressure on Papua New Guinea and small island states which are already
   struggling to cope with sustainable management of their natural
   resources and with the demands of their rapidly growing populations for
   education, housing and employment.
   Regional climate change, in particular sea-level rise, may increase the
   numbers of pacific islanders attempting to migrate permanently to New
   Zealand and Australia. Any such migration strategy is likely to entail
   significant medium-term health, psychological and social costs for some
   Pacific island migrants as they try to cope with life in Western
   industrialised societies. It is unlikely that gradual climate change
   will lead to the forced permanent migration of large populations within
   Australia and New Zealand over the next few decades. Populations in
   developed countries generally have the resources to defend major human
   settlements from predicted sea-level rises and to cope with climatic
   stress in situ. However, sustained climate change may contribute
   ultimately to gradual population shifts within Australia and New
   Zealand.},

Title = {The effects of information publicity and government subsidy on port
   climate change adaptation: Strategy and social welfare analysis},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {284-312},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper develops an integrated economic model to examine two
   competing ports' investment in adaptation to climate-change disasters.
   The ports have asymmetric information on the actual disaster damage. In
   deciding on adaptation investment, the ``leader{''} port is a
   better-informed first mover and the ``follower{''} port is a
   less-informed follower. The government is able to acquire and verify
   port adaptation information and chooses whether to publicize it
   (publicity policy) or keep it confidential (confidentiality policy). If
   the information is publicized, the leader port initiates a signaling
   game in which it makes a decision first, and the follower acts after
   observing the leader's decision. Under the confidentiality policy, both
   ports make their decisions simultaneously. Our analysis shows the
   following. 1) Under the publicity policy, the leader port does not adopt
   a pooling strategy; rather, it determines its adaptation and output
   based on true information on disaster damage (i.e., it implements a
   separating equilibrium). 2) The publicity policy has two effects: it
   increases the leader's throughput while decreasing the follower's
   throughput (i. e., the throughput effect), and it helps rationalize the
   follower's adaptation investment by making more up-to-date disaster
   information available (i.e., the adaptation investment effect). 3) When
   the degree of inter-port competition is high, the publicity policy
   improves social welfare by increasing the total throughput of the two
   ports (i.e., an overall positive throughput effect) and rationalizes the
   follower's adaptation investment (i.e., a positive adaptation investment
   effect). Otherwise, it reduces the total throughput of the ports (i.e.,
   an overall negative throughput effect). This negative throughput effect
   may outweigh the positive adaptation investment effect, thereby reducing
   social welfare. These analytical results suggest that the government
   needs to promote inter-port competition if it decides to publicize port
   adaptation information. Finally, we find that the joint implementation
   of publicity and subsidy policies could result in excessive adaptation
   investment, leading to social welfare loss. Our study illustrates the
   important effects of information asymmetry on adaptation investment and
   has policy implications in the presence of port competition and
   government subsidy.},

Title = {An integrative climate change vulnerability index for Arctic aviation
   and marine transportation},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {Climate change vulnerability research methods are often divergent,
   drawing from siloed biophysical risk approaches or social-contextual
   frameworks, lacking methods for integrative approaches. This substantial
   gap has been noted by scientists, policymakers and communities,
   inhibiting decision-makers' capacity to implement adaptation policies
   responsive to both physical risks and social sensitivities. Aiming to
   contribute to the growing literature on integrated vulnerability
   approaches, we conceptualize and translate new integrative theoretical
   insights of vulnerability research to a scalable quantitative method.
   Piloted through a climate change vulnerability index for aviation and
   marine sectors in the Canadian Arctic, this study demonstrates an avenue
   of applying vulnerability concepts to assess both biophysical and social
   components analyzing future changes with linked RCP climate projections.
   The iterative process we outline is transferable and adaptable across
   the circumpolar north, as well as other global regions and shows that
   transportation vulnerability varies across Inuit regions depending on
   modeled hazards and transportation infrastructures.},

Title = {Examining the Effectiveness of Climate Change Communication with
   Adolescents in Vietnam: The Role of Message Congruency},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change makes coastal communities more vulnerable to floods
   associated with storm surges and sea level rise, requiring both
   adaptation and mitigation measures. Moreover, proper understanding of
   flood risks and their potential impacts on climate change appears to be
   a communication challenge. In climate change communication, the effect
   of framing congruency on perception of risk, efficacy and behavioural
   intentions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation has received
   limited attention. Messages have not been congruent in framing risks
   associated with climate change. We define congruency as the coherent
   alignment of several aspects of message content. Messages are considered
   congruent when they provide recipients with consistent contents such as
   giving concrete and actionable advice, or by providing more abstract and
   general background information. This research focuses on climate change
   communication in fostering mitigation behaviours among adolescents in
   vulnerable locations in the global South. Based on Construal Level
   Theory, this paper investigates how message congruency affects the link
   between perceptions of climate change risk and efficacy and two
   predictors of behavioural change: perceived responsibility and
   mitigation intentions. We conducted an experiment to test the effect of
   congruent vs. incongruent risk communication among adolescents in highly
   vulnerable coastal communities in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam (N = 348).
   Multiple regression analysis found strong effects of congruency in
   message framing; when messages were congruent in the content,
   communicative interventions changed adolescents' perceptions and
   attitudes toward climate change mitigation more consistently. This
   research contributes both theoretically and practically to risk
   communication among adolescents and toward climate change mitigation
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forest stores large organic carbon stocks in a setting that is
   highly vulnerable to climate change and direct anthropogenic influences.
   As such there is a need to elucidate the causes and consequences of land
   use change on these ecosystems that have high value in terms of
   ecosystem services. We examine the areal pattern of land types in a
   coastal region located in southern Iran over a period of 14 years to
   predict future loss and gain in land types to the year 2025. We applied
   a CA-Markov model to simulate and predict mangrove forest change.
   Landsat satellite images from 2000 to 2014 were used to analyze the land
   cover changes between soil, open water and mangroves. Major changes
   during this period were observed in soil and water which could be
   attributed to rising sea level. Furthermore, the mangrove area in the
   more seaward position was converted to open water due to sea-level rise.
   A cellular automata model was then used to predict the land cover
   changes that would occur by the year 2025. Results demonstrated that
   approximately 21 ha of mangrove area will be converted to open water,
   while mangroves are projected to expand by approximately 28 ha in
   landward direction. These changes need to be delineated to better inform
   precise mitigation and adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {Island communities are the targets for a wide range of interventions
   designed to help them adapt to climate change. A growing body of
   research explores the equity and justice implications of adaptation
   policies and programmes, revealing they often exacerbate, rather than
   alleviate, inequality within at-risk communities. This paper pushes
   beyond existing understandings of climate justice, which prioritise its
   distributive and procedural aspects. Through household surveys,
   interviews and participant observation, the paper presents a case study
   of a major adaptation project in a small island community in the
   Philippines, paying particular attention to its equity implications at
   the local level. It describes how local politics and power relations
   distorted the well-intentioned aims of the project and resulted in the
   project exacerbating, rather than alleviating, pre-existing inequality.
   Climate change adaptation is a deeply political process that is easily
   subverted by the interests of the powerful. To mitigate the influence of
   power and politics in future climate adaptation projects, we present an
   expanded multidimensional framework for assessing adaptative justice
   that incorporates the neglected aspects of recognition and structure.},

Abstract = {Tourism is a major global economic sector that is undergoing tremendous
   growth in emerging economies and is often touted as salient for
   development and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Tourism is
   recognized as a highly climate-sensitive sector, one that is also
   strongly influenced by environmental and socioeconomic change influenced
   by climate change, and is also a growing contributor to anthropogenic
   climate change. This article outlines the complex interrelationships
   between climate change and the multiple components of the international
   tourism system. Five focal themes that have developed within the
   literature on the consequences of climate change for tourism are then
   critically reviewed: climatic change and temporal and geographic shifts
   in tourism demand, climate-induced environmental change and destination
   competitiveness within three major market segments (winter sports
   tourism, coastal tourism, and nature-based tourism), and mitigation
   policy developments and future tourist mobility. The review highlights
   the differential vulnerability of tourism destinations and that the
   resultant changes in competitiveness and sustainability will transform
   some international tourism markets. Feedbacks throughout the tourism
   system mean that all destinations will need to adapt to the risks and
   opportunities posed by climate change and climate policy. While notable
   progress has been made in the last decade, a number of important
   knowledge gaps in each of the major impact areas, key regional knowledge
   gaps, and both tourist and tourism operator perceptions of climate
   change risks and adaptive capacity indicate that the tourism sector is
   not currently well prepared for the challenges of climate change. WIREs

Pages = {139-154},
Abstract = {In order to meet the demand for food from a growing global population,
   aquaculture production must be increased as capture fisheries have
   stagnated. Rapid population growth with competition for land and water
   could affect aquaculture production. Although aquaculture uses
   non-consumptive water, there are significant water footprints for
   aquaculture due to water lost and water required for fish-feed
   production. Moreover, climate change affects water availability and
   demand for aquaculture, and poses a further threat to global fish
   production. Nevertheless, the efficient use of blue water (surface and
   groundwater) and green water (rain) in inland, coastal, and marine
   aquaculture could make a significant contribution to global fish
   production and climate change adaptation. Sustainable intensification of
   freshwater aquaculture, mangrove restoration with brackish water fish
   production, and the expansion of mariculture could increase global fish
   production with adaptation to climate change. Institutional support with
   technical and financial assistance is needed to implement the proposed
   adaptation strategies.},

Title = {The Potential of Ocean Iron Fertilization as an Option for Mitigating
   Climate Change},
Booktitle = {EMISSIONS TRADING: INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, DECISION MAKING AND CORPORATE
   STRATEGIES, SECOND EDITION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {195-207},
Abstract = {Ocean iron fertilization is currently being discussed as one measure
   that could contribute to climate change mitigation by stimulating the
   growth of phytoplankton in certain parts of the ocean and enhancing
   oceanic CO2 uptake. Its implementation is greatly debated however and
   its mitigation potential has not yet been explored well. At present, it
   is still not possible to use carbon offsets generated through iron
   fertilization projects for complying with the Kyoto Protocol as trading
   these offsets is currently only possible on voluntary carbon markets.
   Company interests in such a commercial use of ocean iron fertilization
   do however already exist.
   Consequently, there is a need to explore the potential of ocean iron
   fertilization as a climate change mitigation option as well as
   regulatory issues connected with its implementation. This article
   combines these two aims by first examining the scientific background,
   quantitative potential, side effects and costs of ocean iron
   fertilization. In a second step, regulatory aspects such as its legal
   status and open access issues are reviewed. Moreover, the chapter
   analyses how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation
   activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism
   (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization.
   The main findings of this chapter are that the quantitative potential of
   ocean iron fertilization is limited, that potential adverse side effects
   are severe, and that its costs are higher than it was initially hoped.
   Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not
   well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM
   regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.},

Title = {Nest-site choice by loggerhead sea turtles as a risk-management
   adaptation to offset hatching failure by unpredictable storms and
   predators},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {IntroductionAlong the coasts of Florida, United States, the nesting
   season of the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, overlaps with the
   hurricane season. Nesting loggerhead females do not extend parental
   protection beyond depositing eggs in sandy, excavated nests in locations
   that provide a viable range of temperatures, moisture, and respiratory
   gas exchange. Thereafter, a female's clutches are subjected to the
   uncertainties of desiccation, predation, flooding, or beach erosion.
   MethodsHere, we used data from a 1996-2004 study of 94 tagged loggerhead
   females nesting on a small barrier island off the Gulf Coast of south
   Florida, United States. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution
   of nest sites by loggerhead females was a randomized response to
   unpredictable hatching failure. ResultsWe show that nest site choice
   accounted for 19.2\% of variation in hatching success whereas breeding
   year and breeding month accounted for the remaining 81.8\% of variation
   in hatching success. We show that the emergence site along the
   beach-length axis, nest site choice along the beach-width axis, and
   distances between nest locations did not fit a uniform-random
   distribution or a normal distribution. Instead, we show that loggerhead
   females employed a ``Goldilocks{''} distribution in which nest sites
   were ``neither too clustered nor too dispersed.{''} Moreover, loggerhead
   females selected nest sites with limited overlap with nest sites from
   previous breeding seasons. DiscussionWe propose that nest site choice by
   this population of loggerhead females constitutes a significant maternal
   risk-management adaptation that deserves thoughtful consideration as we
   continue to assess the impacts of climate change on the future of
   loggerhead sea turtles.},

Journal = {MARINE BIODIVERSITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {655-666},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coral diversity is increasingly threatened by multiple anthropogenic and
   climate stressors. Threatened species assessments play an important role
   in guiding conservation action for management and mitigation of losses,
   but to provide accurate assessments it is necessary to collect
   quantitative data at an appropriate scale. When assessed at a global
   scale the level of threat facing corals in the tropical western Pacific
   Ocean is perceived to be low. However, whether the global threat
   classifications reflect the needs of species at regional scales remains
   to be verified. Here the status of scleractinian coral diversity is
   explored at a little-known Micronesian locality, Kosrae (5A degrees 15'S
   162A degrees 58 E). Sixteen percent of the species recorded on the
   current survey are classified as Vulnerable on a global scale; however,
   down-scaling the assessment suggests that a larger proportion of species
   (up to 25\%) may be vulnerable to regional extinction because they
   occupy a low proportion of sites. Twelve species are classified as
   Vulnerable at global and regional scales, and further monitoring of
   threatened species is needed to verify the status of 53 species that are
   listed as Data Deficient in the region. Despite the lower level of
   perceived extinction risk to coral communities in the NW Pacific, this
   study suggests the risk of regional diversity loss may be higher than
   expected. Ongoing coral reef monitoring and integrated watershed
   management to mitigate the threat of regional extinctions is needed.},

   has considerable geothermal energy sources represented by hydrothermal
   and hot dry rock (EGS) sources along the western shield margin. By using
   energy source mix the country can offset part of its domestic oil demand
   and reduce considerable amount of CO, emissions. By using geothermal
   energy for desalination alone can save about 13 million Gg of CO2. New

Abstract = {The Mediterranean region has been Found to be specifically vulnerable to
   climatic variability and change. Projections based on observations since
   the beginning of the 20(th) century point to a further increase of water
   deficiency due to climatic and human pressures in the area. The
   Mediterranean part of Morocco's coastline is most vulnerable due to its
   low-lying deltaic plain of the Moulouya River, the main water provider
   in the region, and due to its increasing economic relevance for the
   country. Accelerated sea-level-rise is projected to aggravate coastal
   erosion, risk of flooding and groundwater salinization. At the same time
   sediment shortage as a result of river damming affects natural delta and
   beach nourishment. It has been shown that the complex interactions of
   human encroachment, climatic variability and sea-level-rise will lead to
   a further degradation of the coastal environment and will hinder
   economic development, which in particular focuses on the tourism sector.
   To support this argument a regional assessment is undertaken. CRU long
   time data series For seasonal precipitation and temperature (1901-2005)
   were used to evaluate trends in regional climatic variability; regional
   vulnerability regarding water availability, and the main water consuming
   economic activities were assessed. The analysis shows that there is no
   alternative for the development and implementation of comprehensive
   climate change policies and appropriate adaptation strategies. Otherwise
   sustainable long-term development seems impossible, in particular with
   regard to water availability and coastal tourism.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on the Senegalese coastal zones: Examples of
   the Cap Vert peninsula and Saloum estuary},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {72},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {294-301},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Following a first study made to assess the impacts of sea level rise on
   the Senegalese coastline (Dennis et al., 1995), this vulnerability and
   adaptation (V\&A) study tried to determine the impacts of climate change
   on two representative coastal zones, the Cap Vert peninsula and the
   Saloum estuary as well as potential adaptation options. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Methodology (Carter et
   al., 1994), completed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
   Handbook (Feenstra et al., 1998), were used together with different
   models (like the Bruun rule, the FEFLOW model), geographical information
   system and economic data to determine the physical and socio-economic
   impacts of different climate change scenarios on these coastal zones.
   Land losses are expected due to sea level rise that will enhance coastal
   erosion and increase inundation levels, the second phenomenon being
   responsible for most of these losses, especially in low lying areas like
   the Saloum estuary (27\% of the total area lost with a 1 m inundation
   level). The combination of sea level rise and decreased precipitation
   will increase the salt water intrusion in a number of coastal aquifers,
   especially around Dakar and in the Saloum estuary. Population at risk of
   inundation in the Cap Vert peninsula could represent between 1 and 12\%
   of the total population of this area. Economic values at risk were
   estimated by considering socio-economic scenarios and discount rates.
   For a 1 m inundation level by 2050, this could represent (for the two
   areas) 14.1\% of the actual Gross Domestic Product. While housings
   represent more than 90\% of this value in the Cap Vert peninsula, in the
   Saloum estuary, it is the agricultural production which represents the
   dominant form of value at risk (55\%). Only two adaptation options,
   protection works (sea walls and groins) and afforestation of littoral
   dunes, were evaluated and costed. For a 1 m inundation level by 2050,
   this will represent 7.3\% of the actual Gross Domestic Product The main
   result of this study is the demonstration that protection costs will be
   lower than economic value at risk contrary to the results of the
   previous study. This is mainly attributed to the consideration of
   socio-economic scenarios and a better economic evaluation of the goods
   and services at risk of inundation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The development of a policy framework to mitigate underwater noise
   pollution from commercial vessels: The role of ports},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {120},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Shipping is the most fuel-efficient type of transportation and plays a
   significant role in global trade. However, it has negative
   externalities. With the projected growth of shipping, the potential for
   low-frequency noise will increase along with its negative effects, such
   as impacts on marine species. For example, its intensity has been
   doubling in the North Pacific Ocean every decade for the past 60 years.
   Underwater noise pollution is not visible. Therefore, a scientific
   approach and data collection are required to raise awareness and
   demonstrate its negative impacts. While societal awareness in respect of
   other pollutants, such as oil, dangerous goods, noxious liquids
   substances, sewage, plastic, and air, has been raised and they have been
   regulated, society is not yet familiar with underwater noise pollution
   and, accordingly, there is no international legally binding instrument
   to regulate it. Ports are key interfaces between maritime transportation
   and land and they play a crucial role as one of the main stakeholders in
   the shipping industry. At the same time, this key role can be extended
   to cover prevention, control, mitigation, and monitoring of UWN
   pollution by considering appropriate policies and mitigation measures.
   This paper strives to identify the gaps between the potential measures
   and the current situation in ports and to consider
   multi-interdisciplinary actions by developing the concept of an Under-
   Water Noise Management Plan (UWNMP) within Ports. This plan is also
   expected to contribute to the enhancement of sustainable development
   along with port and ocean governance.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {78-91},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has become a concern in many
   major cities worldwide, as high summer temperatures and poor wind flow
   can have negative impacts on city dwellers, particularly increasing
   energy demand for artificial cooling. This paper showcases how an
   Integrated Multi-scale Environmental Urban Model (IMEUM) can be employed
   to support planners, architects and engineers to assess the combined
   impacts of the UHI phenomenon and rising global temperatures due to
   climate change. IMEUM concept derives from downscaling environmental
   models from global scale (25 km) to mesoscale (1 km) and city scale (100
   m). Hence, this paper showcases a computationally efficient method which
   couples multi-scale atmospheric models with statistical model to
   estimate weather parameters. Developed under Singapore context, IMEUM
   can be utilized to incorporate appropriate UHI mitigation measures
   upfront in design process, consecutively bridging the gap between global
   and building scale. This paper also includes calibration of the IMEUM
   output using observations from ground sensors. Furthermore, by using
   case study of a hypothetical office building, this paper showcases how
   the IMEUM output can be fully converted into a localized weather data
   file for cooling load simulation. IMEUM is currently being developed
   further into integrated quantitative urban environment simulation tool
   (QUEST), which can be used to test the immediate microclimatic impact of
   development plans and assess their long term impacts under future
   climate change scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {American archives and climate change: Risks and adaptation},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {111-125},
Abstract = {Climate change directly affects the future security of cultural
   resources. Cultural heritage and in particular, archives, are
   increasingly at risk of degradation due to climate change threats and
   triggers. This study evaluated present and future consequences of
   water-related climate change impacts using a mapping methodology to
   assess exposure of American archives to incompatible weather extremes.
   Susceptibility to climate change threats like sea level rise, storm
   surge, surface water flooding, and humidity, all influenced by a
   combination of temperature rise and increased precipitation, at a
   worst-case scenario were assessed for 1232 archival repositories.
   Results indicate that approximately 98.8\% of archives are likely to be
   affected by at least one climate risk factor, though on average, most
   archives are at low risk of exposure (90\%) when risk factors are
   combined. Future storm surge plus sea level rise was likely to impact
   17.7\% of archival repositories with 22.1\% affected by only storm surge
   and 4.3\% affected by only sea level rise (1.8m scenario). Fewer
   archives were likely to be susceptible to surface water flooding
   (2.4\%). More than 90\% of archives were estimated to have a temperature
   change greater than +/- 1 degrees C, with 7.5\% of sites likely to
   change by +/- 10 degrees C, and 69.5\% of archives were likely to
   receive at least 152mm more rainfall by 2100 over current annual
   averages. In terms of sustainability, developing appropriate
   socio-economic planning schemes that integrate cumulative exposure of
   archives to future climate patterns is critically important for
   safeguarding society and its heritage. The outcomes from the risk
   assessment in this study aid in the decision-making process by promoting
   strategic adaptation protocols and providing administrators a way to
   prioritize archival management goals based on the expected severity of
   future climate change impacts.},

Abstract = {Climate change is affecting large-scale oceanic processes. How and when
   these changes will impact those reliant on marine resources is not yet
   clear. Here we use end-to-end modeling to track the impacts of expected
   changes through the marine ecosystem on a specific, small community:
   Cochamo, in the Gulf of Ancud wider area, Chile. This area is important
   for Chilean fisheries and aquaculture, with Cochamo reliant on both
   lower and upper trophic level marine resources. We applied the
   GOTM-ERSEM-BFM coupled hydro-biogeochemical water-column model to gauge
   lower-trophic level marine ecological community response to bottom-up
   stressors (climate change, ocean acidification), coupled to an existing
   Ecopath with Ecosim model for the area, which included top-down
   stressors (fishing). Social scientists also used participatory modeling
   (Systems Thinking and Bayesian Belief Networking) to identify key
   resources for Co-chamo residents and to assess the community's
   vulnerability to possible changes in key resources. Modeling results
   suggest that flagellate phytoplankton abundance will increase at the
   cost of other species (particularly diatoms), resulting in a greater
   risk of harmful algae blooms. Both climate change and acidification
   slightly increased primary production in the model. Higher trophic level
   results indicate that some targeted pelagic resources will decline
   (while benthic ones may benefit), but that these effects might be
   mitigated by strong fisheries management efforts. Participatory modeling
   suggests that Cochamo inhabitants anticipate marine ecosystem changes
   but are divided about possible adaptation strategies. For climate change
   impact quantification, detailed experimental studies are recommended
   based on the dominant threats identified here, with specific local
   species.},

Title = {Carbon saving potential of urban parks due to heat mitigation in Yangtze
   River Economic Belt},

Abstract = {Urban parks are considered as an effective, sustainable, and affordable
   heat mitigation strategy. At present, there is a lack of understanding
   of the carbon saving potential of urban parks in the context of urban
   warming. Here we provide a simple approach to estimate the potential
   carbon savings due to heat mitigation based on analysis of 1510 parks in
   26 major urban areas of the years 2017-2021 within the Yangtze River
   Economic Belt (YREB), China's largest sustainability experiment. On
   average, an urban park with 26.9 +/- 1.5 ha in the YREB could avoid 23.7
   +/- 1.6 t CO2 (1.08 +/- 0.03 t CO2/ha) in emissions due to heat
   mitigation per summer day. Considered altogether, the 1510 urban parks
   can offset 5.37\% of the daily fossil fuel emissions in the YREB. To
   boost carbon saving efficiency, lush vegetation should be first
   considered and the coupled green and blue infrastructures are always
   advocated. The total parks carbon saving of cities gradually improved
   along the Yangtze River from west to east, among which Shanghai city (in
   the east of the YREB) is with the largest amount (4341 t CO2). The
   strategies using exquisite landscape design for improving carbon saving
   may differ across different climate zones. These findings can inform
   decision-making for urban sustainable development and climate change
   mitigation, which may benefit China's movement toward carbon neutrality.},

Title = {Nexus City: Operationalizing the urban Water-Energy-Food Nexus for
   climate change adaptation in Munich, Germany},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {28-40},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The contemporary capitalist growth-dependent economy infers that natural
   resources are without limit. This has caused over-consumption of these,
   which has dangerously altered the climate. Despite this issue, with
   on-going economic growth, especially cities continue to consume even
   more such natural resources. Radical new urban planning approaches
   linked to a paradigm shift are urgently needed. Integrated urban
   planning can help cities exploit potential synergies of climate change
   mitigation and adaptation approaches to act on climate change more
   effectively. In this study, a case study neighbourhood of the City of
   Munich, Germany, is used as a model. By applying the Water-Energy-Food
   Nexus approach, the study finds that intensive urban agriculture could
   provide for 66\% of local demand for fruit and 246\% of local demand for
   vegetables; wastewater recycling and reuse coupled with rainwater
   harvesting can save 26\% of current freshwater supply; biogas generation
   from human sewage can save 20\% of current electricity supply; and the
   cost of decentralized wastewater management may be significantly lower
   than the planned renovation of the centralized sewage system. The study
   advocates implementation of pilot projects to study the effectiveness of
   such an approach, which is also relevant to other cities worldwide. (C)

Title = {Cyclone vulnerability assessment of the western coast of Bangladesh},
Journal = {GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS \& RISK},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {198-221},
Abstract = {Coastal Bangladesh is one of the hotspots of tropical cyclone's landfall
   in South Asia. A spatial vulnerability assessment is required to
   formulate disaster risk reduction strategies. This study develops a
   comprehensive tropical cyclone vulnerability mapping approach by
   applying Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and geospatial
   techniques and examines the spatial distribution of tropical cyclone
   vulnerability in the western coastal region of Bangladesh. We have
   selected 18 spatial criteria under the physical, social, and mitigation
   capacity categories as the components of vulnerability. Results indicate
   that the southern and south-eastern peripheral areas exhibit higher
   vulnerability to tropical cyclones since these areas comprise low
   elevation, gentle slope, closeness to the sea, a high number of
   historical cyclone tracks, vulnerable land cover classes (settlements
   and crops land), and poor socio-economic structures. These areas cover
   most of the Barguna, Khulna, Bagerhat, Jhalokati, and southern parts of
   Satkhira, and Pirojpur districts. The existing mitigation capacity
   measures, for example, the construction of cyclone shelters,
   embankments, road networks, and effective warning systems in these areas
   are not adequate levels. The findings would be useful for policymakers
   and local authorities in formulating appropriate cyclone risk mitigation
   plans in coastal Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Hawai`i is the most isolated landmass in the world. It is a unique
   island chain where its beauty and isolation form the ideal vision of
   paradise. Its isolation, however, creates an environment of opportunity
   and challenge. Prior to European contact, Hawai`i maintained a
   population of a million people or more. They developed a land management
   system that adhered to the ecological limits of the island, and they
   learned to live healthy and sustainably within those limits. Modern-day
   Hawai`i, however, has increased anthropocentric impacts that strain
   current resources and deplete local ecosystems. Today, the people of
   Hawai`i are dependent upon other areas of the world for food, energy,
   and other materials. In this chapter I draw upon Leopold's essay,
   ``Thinking Like a Mountain,{''} and Bryan Norton's important work on how
   multi-scalar relationships can be significantly affected by human
   decisions and the importance of valuing the entire island system. Today,
   Hawai`i is experiencing a surge of new strategies that make living in
   the islands more ecologically, economically, and socially resilient.
   This chapter establishes Hawai`i as a model from which other communities
   can draw examples for setting sustainability goals, adaptive management
   techniques, and planning for the future.},

Abstract = {Miami-Dade County is a diverse, low-lying county of approximately 2.5
   million inhabitants, situated along the subtropical stretches of the
   southeastern United States. Situated at the tip of a peninsula, just
   feet above sea level, Miami-Dade County has long been aware of its acute
   vulnerability to climate change, particularly sea level rise. In this
   regard, Miami-Dade County began analyzing and implementing mitigation
   strategies decades before `climate change' and `sustainability' became
   mainstream, and was one of the first local communities to begin actively
   planning for climate change. Through multiple partnerships and
   collaborations, the County has well established itself as a leader, and
   has been actively moving forward to make the community more sustainable
   and more resilient to existing and future projected climate change
   impacts. The County has taken active steps to engage and leverage
   support at the local, regional, state, and federal levels. This multiple
   level stakeholder engagement is one of Miami-Dade County's most valuable
   tools in becoming a more climate resilient community.},

Title = {SLOPE RISK ANALYSIS SUPPORTING POST-DISASTER RECOVERY: THE 2016 KAIKOURA
   EARTHQUAKE},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN GEOMECHANICS JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {On 14 November 2016 a M7.8 earthquake caused significant localised
   damage to transportation infrastructure around Kaikoura, NZ. The strong
   earthquake-induced ground motions in the near-source region resulted in
   substantial rockfall, translational landslides, and channelized debris
   flows. The closure of SH1, the Inland Kaikoura Road and the Main North
   Line railway effectively cut off all land routes into Kaikoura.
   The North Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery Alliance (NCTIR)
   was established to rebuild and reopen the coastal routes. To better
   understand current and future risk to road users, slope risk analyses
   were carried out following the NSW Roads and Maritime Services 2014
   Slope Risk Analysis methodology ( NSW RMS SRA 2014). Various risk
   scenarios were considered reflecting the temporal change in hazards,
   likelihood, and consequences through the post-disaster recovery process.
   The core approach of the NSW RMS SRA methodology was applied to consider
   multiple risk scenarios in order to support the post-disaster
   activities. A total of similar to 70 slope risk analyses were carried
   out over 10km of SH1. Due to the large spatial extent of the slopes and
   source zones, automation of geospatial analysis of LiDAR derived digital
   elevation models increased efficiencies in the analysis and
   documentation.
   The application demonstrated that rapid post-disaster risk reduction
   practices like traffic control and temporary barriers were effective in
   temporarily reducing risk to acceptable levels. The NSW RMS SRA can be
   used throughout the post-disaster response and recovery process to
   understand risk to road users in re-opening the road and optimise the
   balance of proposed risk mitigation options between risk reduction,
   costs and impact to road users.},

Abstract = {Exposure to extreme heat contributes to high morbidity and mortality
   relative to other climate hazards. The city of Philadelphia, PA is
   particularly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme heat, due to the urban

   developed a heat vulnerability index, which identified priority areas
   that are most at-risk of experiencing adverse heat-related health
   outcomes and in need of preparedness and mitigation interventions. An
   interactive website was created to display the maps and allow the public
   to navigate the data with links to potential resources for relief from
   extreme heat days. Such methods can be adapted for other cities that
   wish to identify and target long-term priority areas.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews two recent assessments undertaken in France for
   evaluating national scale consequences of global change for coastal
   hazards and risks, namely marine submersion and coastal erosion. In a
   first approach, the potential consequences of climate change were
   evaluated in a direct quantitative way, however with high uncertainties
   in the final evaluation. Recognizing that uncertainties could hardly be
   reduced, a second assessment based on a multi-criteria evaluation was
   then undertaken. Geomorphological and marine factors that account for
   physical vulnerability to coastal hazards were evaluated for 21 coastal
   entities in metropolitan France. The evaluation was structured using the
   analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The results highlighted the fact
   that in some specific regions such as Languedoc-Roussillon
   (Mediterranean coast) and Pertuis (Atlantic coast), the population is
   expected to increase more than the mean average, while the coastal zone
   are also likely to be more strongly affected by coastal hazards. While
   such national scale evaluations in highly diversified coastal
   environments are still arguable, they may help identifying
   unsustainability in current trends and help defining priorities for
   future adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Scenario analysis on optimal farmed-fish-species composition in China: A

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Fish production from aquaculture and wild captures suffers from the
   rising risk of climate change. This impacts the livelihoods of fishers
   and fish farmers by shrinking wild fishery stocks, inland water
   scarcity, and consequent declines in economic and protein productions.
   China, feeding the most fish of the world with water-intensive crops,
   faces challenges of water scarcity but still be premature in developing
   strategies to adapt to climate change. Here, focusing on methodology
   development, we quantified the water footprint of fish-farming and
   economic and protein productions in the baseline year 2014. Then, 29
   scenarios of farmed- fish-species composition (FFSC, i.e., tons of each
   farmed fish species) were developed for the target year 2020. The
   baseline 2014 shows that fish farming generates an average of 150
   billion m(3) of water footprint, 4.70 million tons of protein, and 263
   billion RMB of economic output (similar to 39 billion USD). Uncertainty
   optimizations were conducted to generate the optimal FFSC solutions that
   show a potential to increase fish production by 22\%, economic and
   protein output by 18\% and 29\%, respectively and simultaneously lower
   water footprint by 22\% to the maximum extent. Nine scenarios that lower
   wild fishery captures were further examined, with optimal FFSC solution
   that encourages aquaculture of Grass carp, Bighead Carp, and Silver
   Carp, and discourages Black carp, Tilapia, Crucian carp, Sea bass, and
   Wuchang bream. From a methodology aspect, this study pulls back
   policymakers from only focusing on the short-term economic interest of
   fish- farming and persuades them to rethink long-term adaptive
   strategies to climate change from multiple sustainable dimensions. (C)

Title = {Implications on food production of the changing water cycle in the
   Vietnamese Mekong Delta},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Mekong Delta is sinking and shrinking due to excessive groundwater
   withdrawal for growing agricultural and other uses, coupled to reduced
   flow of water and sediments caused by upstream dams, growing upstream
   water uses and riverbed mining, reduced replenishment of aquifers, soil
   compaction, infrastructural extension, and thermo-steric sea level rise.
   Salinization of soil and aquifers, depletion of aquifers, constraints to
   fish migration, increased pollution, reduced flow of nutrients,
   deterioration of the coastal mangrove belt, general degradation of the
   ecosystem, and loss of emerged land, make the production of food from
   agriculture and fisheries more difficult, while also limiting the
   availability of clean fresh water for domestic uses. The subsidence
   generated by excessive groundwater withdrawal is more than one order of
   magnitude larger than the thermosteric sea level rise. Particularly
   relevant is also the effect of the reduced flow of water, and sediments
   caused by upstream dams and growing upstream water uses. These drivers
   are changing the low-lying Mekong Delta, with dramatic impacts on food
   security expected by as early as 2050, and the possible complete
   disappearance of the Mekong delta as we know by 2100. While
   technological developments and enforcement of mitigation and adaptation
   strategies expected to overcome the most part of the short term issues,
   with production from aquaculture actually expected to dramatically rise
   to 2050, but contemporary reduced growth, if not reduction in the
   agricultural output, these measures may not be enough by 2100. The
   current rates of development, in both economy and population, are, not
   sustainable. (C) 2020 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Urban plans often ignore the uneven impacts of hazards on socially

Title = {Predicting the Potential Suitable Climate for Coconut (Cocos nucifera

Abstract = {Climate change and climate variability are projected to alter the
   geographic suitability of lands for crop cultivation. Early awareness of
   the future climate of the current cultivation areas for a perennial tree
   crop like coconut is needed for its adaptation and sustainable
   cultivation in vulnerable areas. We analyzed coconut's vulnerability to
   climate change in India, based on climate projections for the 2050s and
   the 2070s under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): 4.5
   and 8.5. Based on the current cultivation regions and climate change
   predictions from seven ensembles of Global Circulation Models, we
   predict changes in relative climatic suitability for coconut cultivation
   using the MaxEnt model. Bioclimatic variables Bio 4 (temperature
   seasonality, 34.4\%) and Bio 7 (temperature annual range, 28.7\%)
   together contribute 63.1\%, which along with Bio 15 (precipitation
   seasonality, 8.6\%) determined 71.7\% of the climate suitability for
   coconuts in India. The model projected that some current coconut
   cultivation producing areas will become unsuitable (plains of South
   interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) requiring crop change, while other
   areas will require adaptations in genotypic or agronomic management
   (east coast and the south interior plains), and yet in others, the
   climatic suitability for growing coconut will increase (west coast). The
   findings suggest the need for adaptation strategies so as to ensure
   sustainable cultivation of coconut at least in presently cultivated
   areas.},

   Ecosystems emphasizes the importance of research focused on population
   genetic structure and evolutionary change for understanding estuarine

   habitats; however, relatively little is known about the role of
   genetically based adaptation (the heritable response to these

   presents 11 studies that use a variety of approaches including
   ecophysiology, ecological genetics, molecular markers, and patterns of
   gene expression occurring within these populations. These studies
   provide examples of the role of genetic diversity and adaptation across
   a diversity of estuarine and coastal environments, and highlight the
   temporal and spatial scales at which adaptation impinges upon
   management. This collection of papers is especially timely, given the
   increasing importance of understanding and predicting the response to
   global climate change in order to effectively manage these communities.},

Title = {The Role of Population Origin and Microenvironment in Seedling Emergence
   and Early Survival in Mediterranean Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Understanding tree recruitment is needed to forecast future forest
   distribution. Many studies have reported the relevant ecological factors
   that affect recruitment success in trees, but the potential for
   genetic-based differences in recruitment has often been neglected. In
   this study, we established a semi-natural reciprocal sowing experiment
   to test for local adaptation and microenvironment effects (evaluated
   here by canopy cover) in the emergence and early survival of maritime
   pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), an emblematic Mediterranean forest tree. A
   novel application of molecular markers was also developed to test for
   family selection and, thus, for potential genetic change over
   generations. Overall, we did not find evidence to support local
   adaptation at the recruitment stage in our semi-natural experiment.
   Moreover, only weak family selection (if any) was found, suggesting that
   in stressful environments with low survival, stochastic processes and
   among-year climate variability may drive recruitment. Nevertheless, our
   study revealed that, at early stages of recruitment, microenvironments
   may favor the population with the best adapted life strategy,
   irrespectively of its (local or non-local) origin. We also found that
   emergence time is a key factor for seedling survival in stressful
   Mediterranean environments. Our study highlights the complexity of the
   factors influencing the early stages of establishment of maritime pine
   and provides insights into possible management actions aimed at
   environmental change impact mitigation. In particular, we found that the
   high stochasticity of the recruitment process in stressful environments
   and the differences in population-specific adaptive strategies may
   difficult assisted migration schemes.},

Title = {A Proposed Simultaneous Calculation Method for Flood by River Water,
   Inland Flood, and Storm Surge at Tidal Rivers of Metropolitan Cities: A
   Case Study of Katabira River in Japan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {All metropolitan cities in Japan are located in low-lying areas that
   surround ports. Accordingly, significant floods that occur in these
   cities will trigger the simultaneous occurrence of flooding by river
   water and inland flooding. However, existing studies have focused on the
   impact of flooding by river water, inland flooding, and high tide in
   tidal rivers, and disaster mitigation measures focused on detailed
   flooding processes in such flooding areas have not been conducted thus
   far. This study focused on a tidal river, i.e., Katabira River of
   Yokohama city, one of Japan's metropolitan cities, to construct a
   simultaneous occurrence model of flooding by river water and inland
   flooding, including the impact of a high tide. Numerical analysis was
   conducted using this model, and the results show that the flooded area
   significantly changed from 0.004 to 0.149 km(2)according to the tide
   level of the estuary. Moreover, by simultaneously solving the
   calculation of flooding by river water and inland flooding, we found
   that there was a difference of 50 min between the occurrences of these
   floods. Therefore, we found that there is a possibility that, if
   evacuation is not conducted at the time of occurrence of inland
   flooding, evacuation during subsequent river-water flooding may not be
   possible. Based on these results, our proposed method was found to be
   useful for tidal rivers of metropolitan cities.},

Title = {Responding to multiple climate-linked stressors in a remote island
   context: The example of Yadua Island, Fiji},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {7-15},
Abstract = {Island societies are being disproportionately affected by climate
   change, a situation likely to continue for some decades. Using an
   example of an island affected by multiple climate-linked stressors, a
   situation likely to become more common in the future, this paper
   examines the nature of these, the ways they are perceived and responded
   to by local residents, and how these people believe environmental
   changes might unfold in the future. Yadua Island has one settlement
   (Denimanu), where most of the 170 residents sustain themselves largely
   by fishing and farming. Like most Pacific Island settlements, Denimanu
   is coastal and has experienced progressive shoreline erosion that, a
   decade ago, washed away a row of houses. In 2012, a storm surge (during
   Tropical Cyclone Evan) demolished most of the remaining bure
   (traditional dwellings) in the village. The Fiji Government relocated
   the affected families to a new upslope location (Korovou), 80-230m from
   the beach, and up to 20m above mean sea level. In March 2017, heavy rain
   caused a landslide at the back of Denimanu that endangered the primary
   school, forcing its abandonment. Some questionnaires were given to
   representative members of the community in an attempt to understand and
   quantify the pressures that Yadua Island people are subject to, and how
   they plan to manage them. All respondents believed that climate change
   has affected their livelihoods and will continue to do so in the future.
   Clear majorities stated that climate change - especially higher
   temperatures and increased frequency/magnitudes of heavyrain events -
   had negatively affected the supply of marine and terrestrial foods. Most
   respondents noted increased temperature and decreased precipitation.
   Clear majorities stated they would eventually relocate their homes
   further inland, and would consider planting mangroves. Most participants
   were contemplating the effects of climate change (especially sea-level
   rise) on food supply, prompting them to consider relocating lowland crop
   production further inland and planting crops that are more tolerant of
   saline groundwater and/or periodic wave over-wash. The people of
   Denimanu recognise how the environment has been changing but debate the
   ultimate cause of this and therefore how best to respond. It is likely
   that Yadua will become impacted more by tropical cyclones and sea-level
   rise (in particular) in the future. To be effective and sustainable,
   adaptation strategies should acknowledge residents' worldviews and
   beliefs rather than try to uncritically substitute them.},

Abstract = {This paper is part of ongoing research designed to develop a dynamic
   model for assessing the vulnerability of waterfront properties to
   sea-level rise (SLR), and to evaluate adaptation options. SLR is one of
   the best recognized effects of projected climate change within recent
   literature, and is expected to continue for centuries. Increased storm
   surge height, due to SLR, may place many coastal properties in danger of
   erosion and inundation, and millions of people living near the sea may
   be forced to relocate. If SLR is a fact, decision makers will need to
   have better tools to understand the, extent and timing of coastal
   hazards. Considering the complexity and dynamic nature of coastal
   systems interacting and changing over time, this research focuses on
   modeling temporal and spatial variations of coastal flooding in
   assessing the vulnerability of these systems to SLR.},

Title = {Evolutionary trade-offs between baseline and plastic gene expression in
   two congeneric oyster species},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Organismal responses to environmental stresses are a determinant of the
   effect of climate change. These can occur through the regulation of gene
   expression, involving genetic adaptation and plastic changes as
   evolutionary strategy. Heat shock protein (hsp) family genes are
   extensively expanded and play important roles in thermal adaptation in
   oysters. We investigated expression of all heat-responsive hsps in two
   allopatric congeneric oyster species, Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata,
   which are respectively distributed along the northern and southern
   coasts of China, using common garden and reciprocal transplant
   experiments. Our results showed that hsps in C. gigas have evolved
   higher basal levels of expression under ambient conditions at each field
   site, with lower expression plasticity in response to heat stress in
   comparison to C. angulata, which exhibited lower baseline expression but
   higher expression plasticity. This pattern was fixed regardless of
   environmental disturbance, potentially implying genetic assimilation.
   Our findings indicate divergent adaptive strategies with underlying
   evolutionary trade-offs between genetic adaptation and plasticity at the
   molecular level in two oyster congeners in the face of rapid climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Barriers to adaptation have emerged as key concerns in climate change
   theory and practice, however there remains little consensus about which
   barriers are the most significant to different groups and how competing
   concerns may be addressed. We investigate the significance of different
   barriers to adaptation for governments, the private sector, and civil
   society in Australia through a systematic analysis of submissions to the
   Australian Productivity Commission's inquiry into barriers to
   adaptation. Our results show that respondents prioritise barriers
   differently according to their respective sectors, and that there are
   competing concerns about which barriers should be addressed first.
   Nevertheless, some barriers are more persistent in the submissions than
   others, with governance and policy seen by most groups as being the
   major impediments to adaptation. We explain the implications of our
   analysis for adaptation politics and policy.},

Abstract = {Climate change and sea level rise urge low-lying countries to draft
   adaption policies. In this context, we assessed whether, to what extent
   and when the Netherlands' current flood risk management policy may
   require a revision. By applying scenarios on climate change and
   socio-economic development and performing flood simulations, we
   established the past and future changes in flood probabilities, exposure
   and consequences until about 2050. We also questioned whether the
   present policy may be extended much longer, applying the concept of
   `policy tipping points'. Climate change was found to cause a significant
   increase of flood risk, but less than economic development does. We also
   established that the current flood risk management policy in the
   Netherlands can be continued for centuries when the sea level rise rate
   does not exceed 1.5 m per century. However, we also conclude that the
   present policy may not be the most attractive strategy, as it has some
   obvious flaws.},

Title = {Air temperature and winter mortality: Implications for the persistence
   of the invasive mussel, Perna viridis in the intertidal zone of the
   south-eastern United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {400},
Number = {1-2, SI},

Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Global climate change and invasive species represent two of the biggest
   threats to the environment. Biological communities are responding to
   global climate change through poleward shifts in distribution, and
   changes in abundance and phenology of both native and non-native
   species. An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather
   events is predicted with global climate change. Much is known about
   mortality events of marine organisms in relation to warm thermal stress
   with relatively little known about cold thermal stress, particularly in
   the tropics. Intertidal species are particularly susceptible to
   fluctuations in aerial conditions and many are considered indicators of
   climate change. Perna viridis is a recent invader to the United States
   where it fouls hard substrates and soft sediment habitats. During winter
   2007/08, a mortality event was observed for P. viridis across Tampa Bay,
   Florida. This mortality event coincided with extreme weather conditions
   when air temperatures dropped below 2 degrees C for a period of 6 h
   during low water. The minimum air temperature recorded was 0.53 degrees
   C. During this period water temperature remained relatively constant
   (similar to 20 degrees C). We provide strong evidence supporting the
   hypothesis that thermal stress relating to exposure to cold air
   temperatures during emersion was the primary factor underpinning the
   mortality event. Similar mortality events occurred in 2009 and 2010,
   also coinciding with prolonged exposure to low air temperatures. In the
   short term, weather may be responsible for the temporary trimming back
   of populations at the edge of their geographic range but in the
   longer-term, it is expected that climate warming will trigger the
   poleward movement of both native and non-native species potentially
   facilitating biotic homogenisation of marine communities. The challenge
   now is to devise adaptive management strategies in order to mitigate any
   potential negative impacts to native biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {Indicators of climate change and social vulnerability in fishing

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {323-333},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Changing climatic conditions are affecting the relationship between
   fishing communities and the marine resources they depend on. This shift
   will require an adaptive response on the part of policy makers and
   fishery managers. In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) established, in its fisheries agency (NOAA
   Fisheries), a set of social indicators of fishing community
   vulnerability and resilience to evaluate the impacts of changes in
   fishery management regimes. These indicators enhance the analytical
   capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social
   impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management.
   Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators
   (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for
   the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to
   assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing
   infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified
   as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in
   this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to
   policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal
   communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable.
   Integration of CSVIs and the new climate change vulnerability indices
   highlight community needs for unique solutions in order to adapt to
   environmental and social changes and maintain their well-being.

Title = {Empirical evidence from Bangladesh of assessing climate hazard-related
   loss and damage and state of adaptive capacity to address them},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Abstract = {Under changing climate, more frequent and severe extreme climate events
   have been causing both economic and non-economic losses and damages to
   local communities living in disaster-prone areas. Based on 14 focused
   group discussions, 20 in-depth interviews, and eight key informant
   interviews, this study sought to understand the losses and damages
   experienced by rural communities in three locations of Bangladesh, which
   are vulnerable to riverine and flash floods or cyclones, associated
   surges \& coastal flooding, and salinity intrusion. This paper first
   captured people's perception about different extreme climate events and
   other climatic stressors affecting their lives and livelihoods.
   Considering the latest extreme climate events, the study estimated the
   economic loss and damage of individual households - in housing,
   agriculture, and health sectors - ranging from US\$ 568 to US\$ 1054 per
   household per event. These losses and damages were highest in the
   south-western coast than the two flood-prone areas in the north and
   north-east, since multiple hazards were causing relatively longer
   impacts on the coast. As non-economic losses and damages, change in
   productive land, stressed mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing,
   sacrificing celebrations, temporary migration, and permanent change in
   profession were common in all three locations. The study also found that
   increased adaptive capacity enabled households to address their extreme
   climate event-related impacts. Households of the study locations, who
   got exposed to information and communication technology, as participants
   of a grassroots development project, have improved their coping and
   adaptation strategies by using the accessed information, technologies,
   and training. They improved their income by changing agricultural
   practices and diversifying livelihood options. They also developed
   leadership, entrepreneurial skills, and connectivity with different
   social and institutional networks. Building on this evidence, this paper
   proposed a conceptual framework showcasing the relationships of adaptive
   capacity with anticipated higher loss and damage scenarios under
   changing climate. This research concluded that more investment on
   raising adaptive capacity of households living in climate vulnerable
   locations is highly required to minimize loss and damage in the
   projected climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Large coastal cities are often the engines of national growth but also
   tend to be areas with high sensitivity to the impacts of climate change.
   Therefore, integrated adaptation plans are essential for turning them
   into resilient cities. National competitiveness strategies are, however,
   increasingly at odds with the very idea of resilient cities, either
   forcing urban sprawl to its limits or transforming green spaces into
   grey spaces within the city. In the midst of heated conflict about how
   to use public land, the role of networks of local initiatives to protect
   green spaces and residential rights of poor and marginal groups becomes
   pivotal to achieve equity and urban resilience. The aim of this paper is
   to explore the dynamics of such networks in Istanbul and investigate how
   to integrate them into local climate change adaptation plans. Conflicts
   over Istanbul's historical urban vegetable gardens (bostan) and the
   construction of the third bridge are good examples of sites of
   contestation which, unless resolved, seriously hinder any possibility of
   agreement and action on climate adaptation plans.},

Abstract = {This study contends that climatic events such as storms and floods may
   significantly impact on cost of protection through climate proofing of
   housing structures along the Atlantic coastal zone in the Southwest
   region of Cameroon. Household level protection is purposely examined on
   the rationale that current protective efforts constitute the building
   blocks for long-term adaptation. Examining the determinants of the cost
   of current protection stands good stead to better inform policy to
   promote future adaptation to climatic stress. Hence, from a research
   sample of 400 households, the study estimates a function that relates
   household-level protection costs to their characteristics. Sixty-four
   percent of the homes studied have been hit at least once by strong
   winds, and an average of 2 times in the last 5 years, and 36\% of houses
   have once been hit by storm surge from the sea nearby. With an average
   monthly income of 120.000 FCFA (US\$ 285), the coastal residents spend
   on average 145,500 FCFA (US\$ 346) in preparation against floods. The
   statistical estimates of the cost function reveal significant positive
   signs, implying that the experiences and location of homes within
   floodplain increases the cost of protection no matter the structural
   characteristics of the house. The study observes that the proximity to
   the coast and in flood plains significantly increases the cost of
   protection, and the ability to invest in preventive measures and climate
   proofing housing structures increase as individual income grows. The
   findings indicate the need for improvement of monitoring and forecasting
   systems for floods, intensification of awareness and proper urban
   planning. The policy implications are reinforced by the low incomes of
   most residents, as this calls for external assistance through transfer
   of planning skills, capital and public options to reinforce the
   resilience and choices made at the household level.},

Title = {Climate change and Canada's north coast: research trends, progress, and

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},

Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-92},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper identifies and characterizes current knowledge on climate
   change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability for Canada's northern
   coastline, outlining key research gaps. Warming temperatures and
   increased precipitation have been documented across the northern coast,
   with the rate of sea ice decline ranging from 2.9\% to 10.4\% per
   decade. Storm intensity and frequency is increasing, and permafrost is
   warming across the region. Many of these changes are projected to
   accelerate in the future, with in excess of 8 degrees C warming in
   winter possible under a high-emission scenario by 2081-2100.
   Vulnerability to these changes differs by region and community, a
   function of geographic location, nature of climate change impacts, and
   human factors. Capacity to manage climate change is high in some
   sectors, such as subsistence harvesting, but is being undermined by
   long-term societal changes. In other sectors, such as infrastructure and
   transportation, limitations in climate risk management capacity result
   in continuing high vulnerabilities. There is evidence that adaptation is
   taking place in response to experienced and projected impacts, although
   readiness for adaptation is challenged by limited resources,
   institutional capacity, and a need for support for adaptation across
   levels of government. Priority areas for future research include (i)
   expanding the sectoral and geographic focus of understanding on climate
   change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; (ii) integrating climatic
   and socio-economic projections into vulnerability and adaptation
   assessments; (iii) developing an evidence base on adaptation options;
   and (iv) monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation
   support. Cross-cutting themes for advancing climate change impacts,
   adaptation, and vulnerability research on the north coast more broadly
   include the need for greater emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches
   and cross-cultural collaborations, support for decision-orientated
   research, and focus on effective knowledge mobilization.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Marine constructions are highly vulnerable to climate change and
   sea-level rise (SLR), leading to increased risk rates of destruction and
   the potential closure of ports, harbors, and marinas along the coast. We
   present a cost-adjustment analysis for such constructions along the
   south-eastern Mediterranean coast, which takes into account the physical
   characteristics of the constructions, and environmental uncertainty
   factors. At 0.5 m SLR, the estimated adjustment cost is USD 280 million,
   and at 1 m SLR, the estimated cost is USD 505 million. These costs are
   equivalent to 0.091\% and 0.165\% of the Israeli gross domestic
   production, respectively. Although high, these adjustment costs are
   lower than the costs of future damage that will accrue if we fail to
   act. This implies that the adaptation-policy approach to controlling for
   the risk of SLR will provide benefits to the economic marine sectors and
   the public at large.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a pervasive and growing global threat to biodiversity
   and ecosystems. Here, we present the most up-to-date assessment of
   climate change impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem
   services in the U.S. and implications for natural resource management.
   We draw from the 4th National Climate Assessment to summarize observed
   and projected changes to ecosystems and biodiversity, explore linkages
   to important ecosystem services, and discuss associated challenges and
   opportunities for natural resource management. We find that species are
   responding to climate change through changes in morphology and behavior,
   phenology, and geographic range shifts, and these changes are mediated
   by plastic and evolutionary responses. Responses by species and
   populations, combined with direct effects of climate change on
   ecosystems (including more extreme events), are resulting in widespread
   changes in productivity, species interactions, vulnerability to
   biological invasions, and other emergent properties. Collectively, these
   impacts alter the benefits and services that natural ecosystems can
   provide to society. Although not all impacts are negative, even positive
   changes can require costly societal adjustments. Natural resource
   managers need proactive, flexible adaptation strategies that consider
   historical and future outlooks to minimize costs over the long term.
   Many organizations are beginning to explore these approaches, but
   implementation is not yet prevalent or systematic across the nation.},

Abstract = {Hundreds of thousands of significant archaeological and cultural
   heritage sites (cultural sites) along the coasts of every continent are
   threatened by sea level rise, and many will be destroyed. This wealth of
   artefacts and monuments testifies to human history, cosmology and
   identity. While cultural sites are especially important to local and
   Indigenous communities, a stall in coordinated global action means
   adaptation at a local scale is often unsupported. In response, this
   paper produces a practical climate change risk analysis methodology
   designed for independent, community-scale management of cultural sites.
   It builds on existing methods that prioritise sites most at risk from
   climate impacts, proposing a field survey that integrates an assessment
   of the relative cultural value of sites with assessment of exposure and
   sensitivity to climate impacts. The field survey also stands as a
   monitoring program and complements an assessment of organisational
   adaptive capacity. The preliminary field survey was tested by Indigenous
   land managers in remote northern Australia at midden and rock art sites
   threatened by sea level rise, extreme flood events and a range of
   non-climactic hazards. A participatory action research
   methodology-incorporating planning workshops, semi-structured interviews
   and participant observations-gave rise to significant modifications to
   the preliminary field survey as well as management prioritisation of 120
   sites. The field survey is anticipated to have global application,
   particularly among marginalised and remote Indigenous communities.
   Well-planned and informed participation, with community control,
   monitoring and well-informed actions, will contribute significantly to
   coordinated global and regional adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a process which is global in nature, but which has
   direct consequences at regional and local levels. Coastal areas as a
   whole, and small coastal river basins across the Baltic Sea in
   particular, are especially vulnerable since they directly suffer the
   influences of phenomena such as heavy precipitation and flash floods,
   the frequency of which has been increasing over the last few years, as
   well as rising sea levels. This paper describes the framework of the
   process of adaptation to climate change in small coastal river basins,
   based on a case study from the city of Klaipeda in Lithuania. In
   particular, the paper outlines the degree of vulnerability of coastal
   areas and describes some of the work undertaken and experiences gathered
   by the EU's BaltCICA project (Climate Change: Impacts, Costs and
   Adaptation in the Baltic Sea Region), which has been undertaken with a
   view to identify the problems and developing adaptation options in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Rivers, their associated floodplains and wetlands are considered as the
   lifeline of millions. Globally these ecosystems are now considered as
   the most degraded, and losing species at a rate faster than the
   terrestrial and marine systems. Serious anthropogenic pressures and
   climate change are likely to intensify the degradation processes
   further. Hence, need of the hour is to develop a holistic management
   tool for protecting these freshwater ecosystems. Ecohydrology is a tool
   that integrates hydrology, geomorphology and biodiversity and forms a
   framework at catchment level for protecting the physical modification
   and biodiversity in rivers with the basic concept of environmental
   flows. Though the concept of environmental flows/ecological release for
   Indian rivers is recently introduced in national water policy, it
   further needs to be suitably incorporated in the climate adaptation
   strategies for an effective integrated water resources development and
   management programme.},

Abstract = {Relocation of communities is widely expected to be an adaptive response
   to sea-level rise, albeit a last resort after exhausting other
   adaptation options. It is a phenomenon, however, from which there are
   few examples to learn. This paper examines relocation processes underway
   in three low-lying coastal villages in Fiji, each affected by coastal
   erosion and flooding. Drawing on the concept of ``everyday agency,{''}
   it considers how environmental changes and planned relocation
   initiatives are resisted, accommodated, or shaped through daily
   activities and decision-making. For residents of these three villages,
   climate change adaptation is not only a matter of adapting to
   environmental changes, but a process of actively steering a way through
   unfolding dimensions of planned relocation. The findings respond to
   increasingly audible calls to recognise the agency of people living in
   climate-vulnerable places, and to highlight everyday responses to
   climate impacts and adaptation initiatives.},

Title = {Projected change in global fisheries revenues under climate change},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Previous studies highlight the winners and losers in fisheries under
   climate change based on shifts in biomass, species composition and
   potential catches. Understanding how climate change is likely to alter
   the fisheries revenues of maritime countries is a crucial next step
   towards the development of effective socio-economic policy and food
   sustainability strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
   Particularly, fish prices and cross-oceans connections through distant
   water fishing operations may largely modify the projected climate change
   impacts on fisheries revenues. However, these factors have not formally
   been considered in global studies. Here, using climate-living marine
   resources simulation models, we show that global fisheries revenues
   could drop by 35\% more than the projected decrease in catches by the
   2050 s under high CO2 emission scenarios. Regionally, the projected
   increases in fish catch in high latitudes may not translate into
   increases in revenues because of the increasing dominance of low value
   fish, and the decrease in catches by these countries' vessels operating
   in more severely impacted distant waters. Also, we find that developing
   countries with high fisheries dependency are negatively impacted. Our
   results suggest the need to conduct full-fledged economic analyses of
   the potential economic effects of climate change on global marine
   fisheries.},

Title = {An indicator-based adaptive management framework and its development for
   data-limited fisheries in Belize},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {28-37},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Decisions regarding the selection and implementation of management
   strategies that constrain fishing pressure can be among the most
   difficult choices that fisheries managers and stakeholders must make.
   These types of decisions often need to be confronted in a data-limited
   context, where few if any management measures are currently in place or
   fisheries are managed independent of adequate scientific advice. This
   situation can sometimes create a high risk of overfishing and potential
   loss of economic and social benefits. To address this situation, simple
   model-free indicator-based frameworks have the potential to be effective
   decision-making platforms for fisheries where quantitative estimates of
   biomass and fishing mortality based reference points are lacking. In
   this paper, a multi-indicator framework is developed that enables
   decision-makers to proceed with management decisions in data-limited
   situations. Model-free indicators are calculated using trends in
   observed data, rather than stock assessment derived estimates of biomass
   and fishing mortality. The framework developed is adaptive so that
   adjustments to catch or effort are recursive and can respond to changing
   environments, socioeconomic conditions, and fishing practices. Using
   stakeholder-defined objectives as a foundation, indicators and reference
   points of fishery performance are chosen that can be evaluated easily by
   undertaking analyses of available data. Indicators from multiple data
   streams are used so that uncertainty in one indicator can be hedged
   through careful interpretation and corroboration of information from
   alternative indicators. During the adaptive management cycle, managers
   and stakeholders evaluate each indicator against the associated
   reference points to determine performance measures, interpret the
   results using scientific and local knowledge, and adjust fishery
   management tactics accordingly using pre-defined harvest control rules.
   The framework facilitates the interpretation of situations in which
   performance measures suggest divergent stock abundance or productivity
   levels. A case study is presented on this framework's development for
   conch and lobster fisheries of Belize.},

Title = {Plasma-enhanced SO2 remediation in a humidified gas matrix: A potential
   strategy for the continued burning of high sulfur bunker fuel},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {274},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {We report a substantial enhancement in the removal of gaseous SO2 by
   discharging a transient nanosecond pulsed plasma in a water
   vapor-saturated gas mixture. With the plasma alone (i.e., ``dry{''}),
   the SO2 remediation is limited to approximately 15\% reduction in SO2
   (i.e., Delta SO2 = 65 ppm). In presence of water vapor, we observe 84\%
   remediation (Delta SO2 = 500 ppm) during plasma discharge due to the
   availability of OH radicals. Here, there is a synergistic effect of
   adding water vapor to the gas mixture in which the plasma excites highly
   reactive OH radical species that drive a two-step reaction process: SO2
   + OH -> HSO3 and the subsequent reaction of HSO3 + OH -> H-2 SO4, which
   precipitates out in the aqueous phase. The efficacy of this approach
   increases as we increase the temperature of the gas matrix, indicating
   the relatively low barriers of this reaction, which is consistent with
   the OH-driven reaction pathway, and it also increases with plasma
   density, thus demonstrating the scalability of this approach. Plasma
   emission spectroscopy as well as Raman scattering spectroscopy provide
   spectroscopic evidence of the OH radical species, further substantiating
   the OH reaction intermediate mechanism. This approach provides a
   promising mitigation strategy for the continued use of high sulfur fuels
   (i.e., bunker fuel).},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {337-343},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Tropical reforestation (TR) has been highlighted as an important
   intervention for climate change mitigation because of its carbon storage
   potential. TR can also play other frequently overlooked, but
   significant, roles in helping society and ecosystems adapt to climate
   variability and change. For example, reforestation can ameliorate
   climate-associated impacts of altered hydrological cycles in watersheds,
   protect coastal areas from increased storms, and provide habitat to
   reduce the probability of species' extinctions under a changing climate.
   Consequently, reforestation should be managed with both adaptation and
   mitigation objectives in mind, so as to maximize synergies among these
   diverse roles, and to avoid trade-offs in which the achievement of one
   goal is detrimental to another. Management of increased forest cover
   must also incorporate measures for reducing the direct and indirect
   impacts of changing climate on reforestation itself. Here we advocate a
   focus on climate-smart reforestation, defined as reforesting for climate
   change mitigation and adaptation, while ensuring that the direct and
   indirect impacts of climate change on reforestation are anticipated and

Title = {Mitigation of urban heat stress - a modelling case study for the area of
   Stuttgart},
Journal = {ERDE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {144},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {202-216},
Abstract = {In 2050 the fraction of urban global population will increase to over 69
   \%, which means that around 6.3 billion people are expected to live in
   urban areas (UN 2011). Cities are the predominant habitation places for
   humans to live and are vulnerable to extreme weather events aggravating
   phenomena like heat stress. Finding mitigation strategies to sustain
   future development is of great importance, given expected influences on
   human health. In this study, the mesoscale numerical model WRF is used
   on a regional scale for the urban area of Stuttgart, to simulate the
   effect of urban planning strategies on dynamical processes affecting
   urban climate. After comparing two urban para-meterisation schemes, a
   sensitivity study for different scenarios is performed; it shows that a
   change of the reflective properties of surfaces has the highest impact
   on near-surface temperatures compared to an increase of urban green
   areas or a decrease of building density. The Urban Heat Island (UHI)
   describes the temperature difference between urban and rural
   temperatures; it characterises regional urban climate and is responsible
   for urban-rural circulation patterns. Applying urban planning measures
   may decrease the intensity of the UHI in the study area by up to 2
   degrees C by using heat-reflective roof paints or by 1 degrees C through
   replacing impervious surfaces by natural vegetation in the urban
   vicinity - compared to a value of 2.5 degrees C for the base case.
   Because of its topographical location in a valley and the overall high
   temperatures in this region, the area of Stuttgart suffers from heat
   stress to a comparatively large extent.},

   procedures},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {190},
Pages = {84-94},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Static and adaptive management procedures (MPs) based on contemporary
   data-poor approaches were tested by management strategy evaluation to
   reveal short-and long-term performance trade-offs. Short-term (10 year)
   and long-term (60 year) performance was evaluated for MPs such as
   Depletion-Corrected Average Catch, Depletion-Based Stock Reduction
   Analysis, and catch-MSY, and also for historical catch scalars. Static
   MPs established a catch limit at the outset of a projection time period
   and were not modified thereafter, which reflected their use as interim
   measures while data collection is improved. Conversely, adaptive MPs
   recursively adjusted catch limits, which reflected their longer-term use
   where data-poor circumstances are unlikely to improve. On average,
   adaptive MPs provided comparable performance over the short term, but
   had superior performance over the long-term and when stocks were
   considered moderately to heavily depleted. Our results highlight
   depletion as a critical quantity in establishing sustainable catches
   from historical catch observations. We reconfirm that depletion-based
   MPs are improvements over catch scalar methods that are widely used in
   US data-poor circumstances and we examine the value in obtaining updated
   depletion estimates to improve catch sustainability in data-poor
   circumstances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article describes the process and outcomes of a pilot
   community-based adaptation (CBA) project implemented on Druadrua Island
   in Fiji. Although many people promote the use of CBA, written material
   about the topic is limited and poorly informed by theory or evidence.
   This article aims to contribute to the literature on CBA by describing
   the theory and process used to implement a CBA project and the changes
   that resulted in a small island community in the northeastern part of
   Fiji. The project outcomes include a renewed focus on community adaptive
   management of natural resources, increased awareness of climate change,
   and an increase in the community's access to resources from external
   organizations. The article concludes with a summary of lessons learned
   and recommendations for future CBA projects. (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {75},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {62-69},
Abstract = {Climate is a driving factor in forest health and productivity that
   limits species survival and affects disturbance processes. Complex
   topography and mosaics of land cover compound the variability of climate
   in eastern Oregon and Washington. The area is a transition zone between
   marine, arctic, and continental influences with associated extremes in
   weather. Such extremes affect insect populations, animal migration,
   streamflow, flooding, and wildfire potential. Additionally, human
   activities such as deforestation and atmospheric pollution interact with
   climate, and may cause changes similar in magnitude to the
   glacial-interglacial epoch in the next 50 to 100 years. Effects of
   anthropogenic climate changes are ambiguous, however, and could
   counter-balance each other. For example, tree populations may have more
   difficulty reestablishing, but growth rates could accelerate.
   Conversely, management actions can mitigate the effect of climate on
   fisheries, water resources, wildfire, and floods. Also, management
   actions can affect climate by modifying carbon exchange and water and
   energy exchange between land and atmosphere. Models are increasingly
   able to predict climate variability and trends in climate-related
   disturbances such as wildfire.},

Title = {Towards sectoral and standardised vulnerability assessments: the example
   of heatwave impacts on human health},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {112},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {687-708},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The relevance of climate change is especially apparent through the
   impacts it has on natural and societal systems. A standardised
   methodology to assess these impacts in order to produce comparable
   results is still lacking. We propose a semi-quantitative approach to
   calculate vulnerability to climate change, with the ability to capture
   complex mechanisms in human-environmental systems. The key mechanisms
   are delineated and translated into a deterministic graph (impact chain).
   A fuzzy logic algorithm is then applied to address uncertainty regarding
   the definition of clear threshold values. We exemplify our approach by
   analysing the direct impacts of climate change on human health in North
   Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, where the urban heat island potential, the
   percentage of elderly population as well as the occurrence of heat waves
   determine impact intensity. Increases in heatwaves and elderly
   population will aggravate the impacts. While the influence of climatic
   changes is apparent on larger spatial scales, societal factors determine
   the small scale distribution of impacts within our regional case study.
   In addition to identifying climate change impact hot spots, the
   structured approach of the impact chain and the methodology of
   aggregation enable to infer from the results back to the main
   constituents of vulnerability. Thus, it can provide a basis for
   decision-makers to set priorities for specific adaptation measures
   within the complex field of climate change impacts.},

Title = {Sensitivity of Flood Hazard and Damage to Modelling Approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Combination of uncertainties in water level and wave height predictions
   for extreme storms can result in unacceptable levels of error, rendering
   flood hazard assessment frameworks less useful. A 2D inundation model,
   LISFLOOD-FP, was used to quantify sensitivity of flooding to uncertainty
   in coastal hazard conditions and method used to force the coastal
   boundary of the model. It is shown that flood inundation is more
   sensitive to small changes in coastal hazard conditions due to the setup
   of the regional model, than the approach used to apply these conditions
   as boundary forcing. Once the threshold for flooding is exceeded, a few
   centimetres increase in combined water level and wave height increases
   both the inundation and consequent damage costs. Improved quantification
   of uncertainty in inundation assessments can aid long-term coastal flood
   hazard mitigation and adaptation strategies, to increase confidence in
   knowledge of how coastlines will respond to future changes in sea-level.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Social-ecological system (SES) management requires targets to move in a
   desirable direction. However, setting targets at the outset of a
   management program is challenging. People representing the demand side
   are not always aware of the benefits of nature that are desirable.
   Simultaneously, managers-who represent the supply side-have limited
   scientific information. Therefore, we propose an adaptive SES management
   matrix (ASESMM) using soft targets that are temporary and hypothetical
   because such targets cannot be fixed at the outset. By compiling both
   demand- and supply-side perspectives, the ASESMM helps managers choose
   feasible and desirable management practices. Ecosystem services' (ESs)
   classifications were adopted to capture the benefits and used as soft
   targets that can change over time. This ASESMM was developed by applying
   it to a Japanese coastal zone in consultation with the relevant
   stakeholders to maintain its practical value. A narrative analysis
   substantiated the lack of peoples' recognition of nature's benefits and
   the influence of ES information on that recognition. It also
   substantiated the comprehensiveness of the ESs' classifications.
   Moreover, the application revealed its usefulness for realizing satoumi,
   a Japanese concept of social-ecological production seascapes, as it
   might help managers enhance synergies as well as minimize the trade-offs
   associated with prioritized ESs. Although it was applied to a seascape
   in this study, the ASESMM can be applied to any SES management site in
   general, including landscapes.},

Title = {Measuring, mapping and modelling: an integrated approach to the

Journal = {WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems appear particularly vulnerable to the
   impacts of climate change, and their effective management will require
   forecasts of how these wetland habitats are likely to respond to
   sea-level rise through the twenty-first century. We describe a
   preliminary study of a small stand of mangrove and saltmarsh that
   involves measuring of elevation change and accretion, mapping of wetland
   communities, and modelling of their potential response to sea-level
   rise. The wetland occurs on the banks of the Minnamurra River estuary in
   southern New South Wales and has been the focus of several studies over
   recent decades. The research includes empirical measurements of
   sedimentation at sites in both mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation using
   the surface elevation table-marker horizon technique. This is a site at
   which mapping has been undertaken to delineate the extent of each
   vegetation community from a time-series of aerial photographs using
   geographical information systems; the gradual incursion of the mangrove,
   Avicennia marina, into more landward saltmarsh communities, observed
   over past decades for many systems in southeastern Australia, has
   continued into the twenty-first century. The observed patterns of change
   are compared with simulations of how this wetland system might respond
   to future sea-level rise, adopting several different approaches and the
   upper and lower bounds of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   sea-level rise projections. The model results show considerable
   variability in response depending on the parameters adopted. We advocate
   the need for the integration of these three approaches, measuring,
   mapping and modelling, as a basis for future management and adaptation.
   Our study demonstrates the considerable opportunities to refine the data
   input and model outputs as part of adaptive management, as more
   sophisticated technologies and data become available.},

Abstract = {The primitive atmosphere where aerobic life started on earth was hypoxic
   and hypercapnic. Remarkably, an adaptation strategy whereby O-2 partial
   pressure, P-O2 in the arterial blood is maintained within a low and
   narrow range of 1-3 kPa, largely independent of inspired P-O2 has also
   been reported in modern water-breathers. In mammalian tissues, including
   brain, the most frequently measured P-O2, is in the same low range.
   Based on the postulate that basic cellular machinery has been
   established since the early stages of evolution, we propose that this
   similarity in oxygenation status is the consequence of an early
   adaptation strategy which, subsequently throughout the course of
   evolution, maintained cellular oxygenation in the same low and primitive
   range independent of environmental changes. The rational for such an
   evolutionary theory is discussed in terms of an equilibrium between
   physiological and pathological reactions associated with O-2 excess vs
   O-2 lack and emerging concepts about the importance of cellular
   O-2-dependent mechanisms in the low but physiological P-O2, range. (C)

Title = {Place-based network organizations and embedded entrepreneurial learning
   Emerging paths to sustainability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {504-523},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an original six-phase
   model describing entrepreneurial learning in the transition of
   place-based enterprises toward a sustainable exploitation of natural
   common resources (commons).
   Design/methodology/approach - The six-phase model proposed by this study
   explains the learning processes involving place-based enterprises
   through two important existing theories: adaptive co-management and
   Lachmann's evolutionary, embedded theory of entrepreneurship. The
   proposed model integrates these two theories on the basis of a
   longitudinal case study on the fishing enterprises in an Italian marine
   protected area (MPA).
   Findings - In the case study, the success factors identified by the
   adaptive co-management literature proved important in enabling an
   embedded entrepreneurial learning process consistent with Lachmann's
   view. The case analysis allowed the authors to cluster these learning
   processes around six phases. Further, even if traditional fishing is not
   knowledge- intensive, this case shows the transition to a sustainable
   business model required intense efforts of educated institutional work
   and scientific research. Interestingly, the key learning processes were
   enabled by the emergence of a larger, networked social entity (a network
   form of organization) including the community of fishermen, the MPA
   management and a network of scientists studying the marine area
   ecosystem.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is explorative and relies
   on a single case study. Despite this limitation, it opens up new
   research paths in the fields of entrepreneurship, institutional work,
   network organizations and adaptive management of the commons.
   Originality/value - This study is strongly interdisciplinary; it
   proposes an original model based on a theoretical view that is highly
   innovative for organization and management studies; and addresses a
   relevant but overlooked issue with important societal implications.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation in an era of global change and scarce funding
   benefits from approaches that simultaneously solve multiple problems.
   Here, we discuss conservation management of the island scrub-jay
   (Aphelocoma insularis), the only island-endemic passerine species in the
   continental United States, which is currently restricted to
   250-square-kilometer Santa Cruz Island, California. Although the species
   is not listed as threatened by state or federal agencies, its viability
   is nonetheless threatened on multiple fronts. We discuss management
   actions that could reduce extinction risk, including vaccination,
   captive propagation, biosecurity measures, and establishing a second
   free-living population on a neighboring island. Establishing a second
   population on Santa Rosa Island may have the added benefit of
   accelerating the restoration and enhancing the resilience of that
   island's currently highly degraded ecosystem. The proactive management
   framework for island scrub-jays presented here illustrates how
   strategies for species protection, ecosystem restoration, and adaptation
   to and mitigation of climate change can converge into an integrated

Abstract = {The endangered New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri is killed as
   incidental bycatch in a trawl fishery operating near their second
   largest population on Campbell Island in New Zealand's sub-Antarctic.
   Using the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) procedure to assess the
   sustainability of this bycatch for the sea lion population on Campbell
   Island indicated that annual bycatch estimates, particularly following
   the implementation of bycatch mitigation measures, are below the PBR
   threshold of 25 (derived using a precautionary approach). Preliminary
   Population Viability Analysis (PVA) modelling supported the finding that
   current bycatch levels, especially given a strong male bias (98\%) in
   bycatch, are sustainable for this population. Models showed that
   reducing pup mortality through management actions, such as installing
   ramps in wallows where large numbers of pups drown, would lead to
   increased population growth. While obtaining more accurate data on
   population status and demographic parameters for the Campbell Island
   population should be a priority, this will take many years of research.
   The PBR and PVA tools demonstrate that contemporary conservation
   management should continue to focus on increasing pup survival while
   maintaining mitigation approaches that have reduced bycatch to low
   levels, together with high observer coverage to sustain confidence in
   annual bycatch estimates.},

Abstract = {The influence of climate change on tourism demand patterns will be
   shaped by the response of tourists to the complexity of mitigation
   policy anti its impacts on transportation systems, the wide range of
   climate change impacts on destinations, as well as broader impacts on
   society and economic development. Tourists have the largest adaptive
   capacity of elements within the tourism system because of their
   flexibility to substitute the place, timing and type of holiday, even at
   very short notice. Consequently, understanding tourist perceptions and
   reactions to the impacts of climate change is essential to anticipating
   the potential geographic and seasonal shifts in tourism demand, as well
   as the decline or increase of specific tourism markets. Yet, despite a
   wide range of publications assessing reactions of tourists to various
   environmental and climate-related changes, little is actually known
   about the complexity of demand responses. The paper reviews and
   discusses existing studies, and provides a framework for a better
   understanding of perceptions of change, as well as identifying major
   current uncertainties and research needs.},

Abstract = {Increasing demand for potable water coupled with diminishing water
   resources due to pollution and unsustainable utilization create a
   challenge in providing sustainable sources of potable water. It is
   therefore vital to protect our existing water resources from pollution
   while achieving economic and social development. Water quality models
   are useful tools for simulation of pollution levels, due to pollutants
   released into a certain water body. Mitigation measures for reducing the
   adverse environmental impact can be explored via model simulations.
   These model-predicted impacts and suggested mitigation measures provide
   a basis for environmental management agencies to make the right
   decisions. In this paper, we present an in-house two-dimensional water
   quality simulation model codenamed TUNA-WQ. As an in-house model,
   TUNA-WQ can be revised and adapted to broaden the applicability and
   improve the robustness of the model. Further, proprietary models are
   costly to maintain for individuals without access to institutional
   support. We begin the paper by introducing the development of TUNA-WQ,
   starting from specifying the equations and numerical method employed.
   This is followed by verification of the model through comparison with a
   tested water quality simulation model. To demonstrate the application of
   TUNA-WQ, we conclude the paper by presenting the TUNA-WQ simulated
   suspended sediment plumes in the top water column due to discharge from
   an offshore oil and gas exploration platform in the South China Sea.},

Title = {Heat stress vulnerability and risk at the (super) local scale in six

Abstract = {Brazilian cities host 86\% of the country's population and have been
   more intensely hit by rising temperatures than the average of cities
   across the world over the last century. Nevertheless, assessments of the
   vulnerability of Brazilian urban dwellers to urban heat islands (UHI)
   are scarce. In this study, we take advantage of the availability of
   high-resolution data to calculate the heat stress vulnerability and risk
   indexes (HSVI and HSRI, respectively) for people inhabiting six
   Brazilian metropolitan areasManaus, Natal, Vitoria, SAo Paulo, Curitiba,
   and Porto Alegre. The indexes are calculated by mathematically relating
   indicators of exposure (distribution of >65-year-old elderly people),
   sensitivity/adaptive capacity (human development index, HDI), and hazard
   (surface temperature). The resulting HSVI maps reflect the socioeconomic
   (HDI) differences found among the studied cities, with the most
   vulnerable people located in the poorest neighborhoods in Manaus (0.720)
   and Natal (0.733), distributed among lower- and mid-class zones in SAo
   Paulo (0.794) and Vitoria (0.772), or invariably located in the wealthy
   zones of Curitiba (0.783) and Porto Alegre (0.762). Two distinct
   patterns are identified for the HSRI: in SAo Paulo, Vitoria, Curitiba,
   and Porto Alegre, high and very high risks are found in the wealthy
   zones of the cities, whereas in Natal and Manaus, high and very high
   risks are encountered in the poorly developed city zones, a result that
   was strongly driven by the UHI pattern. Better communication of heat
   stress risk and the improvement of city greenness should be the focus of
   near-term adaptation strategies for the mapped vulnerable population.},

Abstract = {South Florida's water infrastructure and ecosystems are under pressure
   from socio-economic growth. Understanding the region's water resources
   management tradeoffs is essential for developing effective adaptation
   strategies to cope with emerging challenges such as climate change and
   sea level rise, which are expected to affect many other regions in the
   future. We describe a network-based hydro-economic optimization model of
   the system to investigate the tradeoffs, incorporating the economic
   value of water in urban and agricultural sectors and economic damages
   due to urban flooding while also accounting for water supply to sustain
   fragile ecosystems such as the Everglades and coastal estuaries. Results
   illustrate that maintaining high reliability of urban water supply under
   scenarios of reduced water availability (i.e., drier climate conditions)
   may trigger economic losses to the Everglades Agricultural Area, which
   will likely become more vulnerable as competition over scarce water
   resources increases. More pronounced economic losses are expected in
   urban and agricultural areas when flows to the Everglades are
   prioritized. Flow targets for coastal estuaries are occasionally
   exceeded under optimal flow allocations to various demand nodes,
   indicating that additional storage may be needed to maintain the
   environmental integrity of the estuarine ecosystems. Wetter climate
   conditions, on the other hand, generally lead to increased flows
   throughout the system with positive effects on meeting water demands,
   although flood mitigation efforts will necessitate additional releases
   to the estuaries. Strengths and limitations of the hydro-economic model
   are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Global climate change and potential effects on Pacific salmonids in

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {169-193},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {General circulation models predict increases in air temperatures from 1A
   degrees C to 5A degrees C as atmospheric CO2 continues to rise during
   the next 100 years. Thermal regimes in freshwater ecosystems will change
   as air temperatures increase regionally. As air temperatures increase,
   the distribution and intensity of precipitation will change which will
   in turn alter freshwater hydrology. Low elevation floodplains and
   wetlands will flood as continental ice sheets melt, increasing
   sea-levels. Although anadromous salmonids exist over a wide range of
   climatic conditions along the Pacific coast, individual stocks have
   adapted life history strategies-time of emergence, run timing, and
   residence time in freshwater-that are often unique to regions and
   watersheds. The response of anadromous salmonids will differ among
   species depending on their life cycle in freshwater. For pink and chum
   salmon that migrate to the ocean shortly after they emerge from the
   gravel, higher temperatures during spawning and incubation may result in
   earlier entry into the ocean when food resources are low. Shifts in
   thermal regimes in lakes will change trophic conditions that will affect
   juvenile sockeye salmon growth and survival. Decreased summer stream
   flows and higher water temperatures will affect growth and survival of
   juvenile coho salmon. Rising sea-levels will inundate low elevation
   spawning areas for pink salmon and floodplain rearing habitats for
   juvenile coho salmon. Rapid changes in climatic conditions may not
   extirpate anadromous salmonids in the region, but they will impose
   greater stress on many stocks that are adapted to present climatic
   conditions. Survival of sustainable populations will depend on the
   existing genetic diversity within and among stocks, conservative harvest
   management, and habitat conservation.},

Title = {Sea-level rise and its possible impacts given a `beyond 4 degrees C

Abstract = {The range of future climate-induced sea-level rise remains highly
   uncertain with continued concern that large increases in the
   twenty-first century cannot be ruled out. The biggest source of
   uncertainty is the response of the large ice sheets of Greenland and
   west Antarctica. Based on our analysis, a pragmatic estimate of
   sea-level rise by 2100, for a temperature rise of 4 degrees C or more
   over the same time frame, is between 0.5m and 2m-the probability of
   rises at the high end is judged to be very low, but of unquantifiable
   probability. However, if realized, an indicative analysis shows that the
   impact potential is severe, with the real risk of the forced
   displacement of up to 187 million people over the century (up to 2.4\%
   of global population). This is potentially avoidable by widespread
   upgrade of protection, albeit rather costly with up to 0.02 per cent of
   global domestic product needed, and much higher in certain nations. The
   likelihood of protection being successfully implemented varies between
   regions, and is lowest in small islands, Africa and parts of Asia, and
   hence these regions are the most likely to see coastal abandonment. To
   respond to these challenges, a multi-track approach is required, which
   would also be appropriate if a temperature rise of less than 4 degrees C
   was expected. Firstly, we should monitor sea level to detect any
   significant accelerations in the rate of rise in a timely manner.
   Secondly, we need to improve our understanding of the climate-induced
   processes that could contribute to rapid sea-level rise, especially the
   role of the two major ice sheets, to produce better models that quantify
   the likely future rise more precisely. Finally, responses need to be
   carefully considered via a combination of climate mitigation to reduce
   the rise and adaptation for the residual rise in sea level. In
   particular, long-term strategic adaptation plans for the full range of
   possible sea-level rise (and other change) need to be widely developed.},

Abstract = {The National Institute for Coastal and Harbor Infrastructure (NICHI),
   working with the Metro NY-NJ storm surge working group (SSWG), is a
   collaborating team of economists, engineers, oceanographers,
   meteorologists, geologists, ecologists, architects, social scientists,
   policy makers, consultants, and private citizens. NICHI is serving as a
   clearinghouse for research and advocacy, exploring the premise that the
   future protection of metropolitan New York from catastrophic extreme
   weather events and climate change necessitates a regional approach that
   transcends geographical and political boundaries. Using recent
   scientific, engineering, and economic evaluations, NICHI advocates the
   construction of moveable marine-based storm surge barriers at two
   strategic locations: between Sandy Hook and Far Rockaway (to arrest
   ocean surges) and across the upper East River (to block surges from Long
   Island Sound). The navigation gates would normally be open to shipping
   traffic, but activated only when a significant storm surge threat is
   forecast. Such a system could have a useful working life of at least 100
   years, when sea level may have risen by similar to 2 m; at that time, a
   planned retreat inland may be necessary. NICHI is working to develop a
   consensus among elected officials, agency personnel, advisory groups,
   policy makers, and stakeholders on risk reduction and mitigation
   measures; disseminate information on the risks of climate change and
   extreme storm events to the public and governmental officials. NICHI
   seeks to provide agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers and
   supporting state and city agencies creative ideas and information
   necessary for the evaluation of risk reduction, cost/benefits, design,
   construction, and operational costs necessary to fully develop a
   long-term regional plan to protect Metropolitan New York as a world
   center of finance, business, transportation, communication, medicine,
   and the arts.},

Title = {Climate change implications for olive flowering in Crete, Greece:
   projections based on historical data},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {175},
Number = {1-2},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to pose major challenges for olive
   cultivation in many Mediterranean countries. Predicting the development
   phases of olive trees is important for agronomic management purposes to
   foresee future climate impact and proactively act toward adaptation and
   mitigation strategies. In this study, a statistical model was developed
   based on winter chill accumulation and, in sequence, on heat
   accumulation to assess the changes in flowering occurrence for Olea
   europaea cv. Koroneiki, in the island of Crete, Greece. The model was
   based on and calibrated with long-term phenological observations and
   temperature data from four different sites in the island, spanning an
   elevation gradient between 45 and 624 m a.s.l. This model was used to
   assess the changes in flowering emergence under two Representative
   Concentration Pathway scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, as projected by
   seven high-resolution Euro-CORDEX Regional Climate Models. Changes in
   chill accumulation were determined using the Dynamic Model. Reduction
   rates in chill accumulation for the whole chilling season ranged between
   12.0 and 28.3\% for the near future (2021-2060) and 22.7 and 70.9\% for
   the far future (2061-2100), in comparison to the reference period of
   1979-2019. Flowering was estimated to occur between 6 and 10 days
   earlier in the near future and between 12 and 26 days earlier in the far
   future, depending on the elevation and the climate change scenario.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Disturbance of marine sediments results in the remineralization of
   sedimentary organic matter (OM) and impacts upon natural burial
   processes. Management interventions which restrict or remove activities
   that cause seabed disturbance may offer effective strategies to protect
   the most vulnerable of these shelf sea OM stores, offering new
   opportunities to deliver climate mitigation actions. While the largest
   quantities of OM are often stored in the expansive offshore regions of
   continental shelves and might therefore suggest appropriate zones for
   management interventions to protect vulnerable OM stores, our results
   highlight that these offshore regions generally contain OM of low
   reactivity. Conversely, inshore and coastal sediments store significant
   quantities of highly reactive OM that is at greater risk of
   remineralization when disturbed. The marked spatial disparities between
   OM reactivity across shelf sea sedimentary environments highlights the
   need to focus emergent policy and future management interventions toward
   the protection of inshore and coastal sediments.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {176},
Pages = {81-92},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Besides mitigation and adaptation, climate engineering, i.e. the large
   scale manipulation of the climate system has recently been promoted as a
   third strategy to combat the unwanted consequences of anthropogenic
   climate change. In this contribution, we address three climate
   engineering schemes that have been proposed. One scheme attempts to
   reduce the incoming solar radiation far outside the atmosphere, the
   other two increase the earth albedo either by introducing aerosols into
   the stratosphere or by modifying clouds in the lower marine atmosphere.
   While all three schemes face severe engineering challenges, they are in
   principle able to bring the global energy budget back toward the
   preindustrial value. However, this only holds for the global average,
   while unintentional regional climate response must be expected. The
   regional response is hardly predictable, and it is even rather difficult
   to detect in view of climatic variability. On the other hand, climate
   engineering would have severe ecological, societal, legal and political
   implications. We conclude that none of the schemes offers itself as
   remedy for climate change, but argue that dedicated research on their
   potential and consequences is advisable.},

Title = {Adaptive capacity and coping strategies of small-scale coastal fisheries
   to declining fish catches: Insights from Tanzanian communities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {67-76},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Small-scale fishing communities are expected to adapt to fish catch
   fluctuations linked to global environmental change. Notwithstanding,
   impacts from severe climate events and overexploitation of fisheries
   resources can compromise functions and resilience of ecosystems and
   associated species, and thereby jeopardize long-term population trend
   stability and fisheries productivity. To date, most assessments and
   vulnerability studies of fisheries-dependent populaces have focused on
   global, regional and national levels, while studies at village and
   community levels, where adaptive planning in the context of climate- and
   environmental changes is important, are less common. Based on data from
   official fishery records over a three-decadal period (1984-2016) and
   recent interviews with artisanal fishermen (319 fishers from eight
   communities) along the Tanzanian coast, we assessed small-scale
   fisheries with regard to (i) long-term trends in fishery landings, (ii)
   long-term alterations in fishing gear use, and (iii) fishers'
   perceptions on how they have been coping and adapting to fluctuating
   fish landings. We further investigated (iv) the adaptive capacity of a
   wide range of coastal villages by assessing the fishers' responses to an
   anticipated future scenario of a major (50 \%) decline in landings from
   the current fisheries catch levels. The long-term trend records of fish
   landings showed a remarkable similar to 50 \% reduction in terms of both
   catch per vessel and catch per fisher from 1984 to 2016. According to
   the interviews, the majority of fishers (75 \%) have changed fishing
   grounds from nearshore to offshore areas during the last decade, owing
   to a general perception that nearshore areas have suffered major
   reduction in fish stocks (due to overfishing and environmental changes
   related to extreme climate- or weather events), while offshore areas
   were considered still productive. The change in location of fishing
   grounds is probably a result of the clear switch in major gear type
   utilization from beach seine to ring net that occurred over the last
   decades. With a further progressive decline in fishery catches to a
   predictive level of 50 \% of the current catch level, there is a general
   perception that artisanal fishers will continue fishing because
   alternative livelihoods (like crop farming, which employs more than 65
   \% of the population) have suffered similar negative impact. These
   findings highlight the need for building adaptive capacity in local
   coastal communities to develop alternative coping strategies for the
   impacts of climate- and environmental changes.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Heightened recognition of impacts to coastal salt marshes from sea-level
   rise has led to expanding interest in using thin-layer sediment
   placement (TLP) as an adaptation tool to enhance future marsh
   resilience. Building on successes and lessons learned from the Gulf and
   southeast U.S. coasts, projects are now underway in other regions,
   including New England where the effects of TLP on marsh ecosystems and
   processes are less clear. In this study, we report on early responses of
   a drowning, microtidal Rhode Island marsh (Ninigret Marsh, Charlestown,
   RI) to the application of a thick (10-48 cm) application of sandy
   dredged material and complimentary extensive adaptive management to
   quickly build elevation capital and enhance declining high marsh plant
   species. Physical changes occurred quickly. Elevation capital, rates of
   marsh elevation gain, and soil drainage all increased, while surface
   inundation, die-off areas, and surface ponding were greatly reduced.
   Much of the marsh revegetated within a few years, exhibiting aspects of
   classic successional processes leading to new expansive areas of high
   marsh species, although low marsh Spartina alterniflora recovered more
   slowly. Faunal communities, including nekton and birds, were largely
   unaffected by sediment placement. Overall, sediment placement provided
   Ninigret Marsh with an estimated 67-320 years of ambient elevation gain,
   increasing its resilience and likely long-term persistence. Project
   stakeholders intentionally aimed for the upper end of high marsh plant
   elevation growth ranges to build elevation capital and minimize
   maintenance costs, which also resulted in new migration corridors,
   providing pathways for future marsh expansion.},

Title = {Understanding the combined effects of multiple stressors: A new
   perspective on a longstanding challenge},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {821},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Wildlife populations and their habitats are exposed to an expanding
   diversity and intensity of stressors caused by human activities, within
   the broader context of natural processes and increasing pressure from
   climate change. Estimating how these multiple stressors affect
   individuals, populations, and ecosystems is thus of growing importance.
   However, their combined effects often cannot be predicted reliably from
   the individual effects of each stressor, and we lack the mechanistic
   understanding and analytical tools to predict their joint outcomes. We
   review the science of multiple stressors and present a conceptual
   framework that captures and reconciles the variety of existing
   approaches for assessing combined effects. Specifically, we show that
   all approaches lie along a spectrum, reflecting increasing assumptions
   about the mechanisms that regulate the action of single stressors and
   their combined effects. An emphasis on mechanisms improves analytical
   precision and predictive power but could introduce bias if the
   underlying assumptions arc incorrect. A purely empirical approach has
   less risk of bias but requires adequate data on the effects of the full
   range of anticipated combinations of stressor types and magnitudes. We
   illustrate how this spectrum can be formalised into specific analytical
   methods, using an example of North Atlantic right whales feeding on
   limited prey resources while simultaneously being affected by
   entanglement in fishing gear. In practice, case-specific management
   needs and data availability will guide the exploration of the stressor
   combinations of interest and the selection of a suitable trade-off
   between precision and bias. We argue that the primary goal for adaptive
   management should be to identify the most practical and effective ways
   to remove or reduce specific combinations of stressors, bringing the
   risk of adverse impacts on populations and ecosystems below acceptable
   thresholds.},

Title = {Design of an Optimal Compliance Monitoring Network and Feedback
   Information for Adaptive Management of Saltwater Intrusion in Coastal
   Aquifers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {140},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Management strategies for the optimal and sustainable use of groundwater
   resources are developed based on prescriptive models that use
   mathematical tools for simulation and optimization together with field
   data. Because of the uncertainty inherent in the groundwater systems, it
   is essential to verify the compliance of the implemented strategies to
   those prescribed by using proper monitoring techniques during and after
   the implementation stages of the groundwater management project. In this
   work, an adaptive management approach for optimal management and
   monitoring of coastal aquifers is proposed. A simulation-optimization
   approach is used to derive optimal pumping strategy for the management
   of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. Then, an optimal monitoring
   network is designed to evaluate the compliance of the aquifer responses
   in the field with those predicted by the simulation-optimization model.
   The designed network can be used to monitor the compliance in the field
   in terms of the salinity concentration levels, which result from the
   implementation of the optimal pumping strategy. Uncertainty in the
   values of groundwater parameters and the uncertainty resulting from the
   deviation of the pumping strategies from the prescribed optimum values
   are characterized by considering different realizations of these values
   in the three-dimensional density dependent flow and transport simulation
   model. A new objective for monitoring is considered in this study. The
   objective function consists of maximizing the coefficient of variation
   of the salinity concentration at the monitored locations and minimizing
   the correlation coefficient between the concentrations at the monitored
   locations. Using this objective, the monitoring locations are chosen in
   regions where the uncertainty in the concentration values is highest,
   and those locations where the correlation between the concentrations of
   the monitored locations is lowest, so that the redundancy in monitoring
   data is the least. The concentration data collected at the optimal
   compliance monitoring locations can be used as feedback information to
   improve the initially developed optimal coastal aquifer management
   strategies. The sequential modification of the optimal pumping
   strategies in stages is illustrated using numerical experiments. (C)

Title = {Ocean model resolution dependence of Caribbean sea-level projections},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise poses severe threats to coastal and low-lying regions
   around the world, by exacerbating coastal erosion and flooding. Adequate
   sea-level projections over the next decades are important for both
   decision making and for the development of successful adaptation
   strategies in these coastal and low-lying regions to climate change.
   Ocean components of climate models used in the most recent sea-level
   projections do not explicitly resolve ocean mesoscale processes. Only a
   few effects of these mesoscale processes are represented in these
   models, which leads to errors in the simulated properties of the ocean
   circulation that affect sea-level projections. Using the Caribbean Sea
   as an example region, we demonstrate a strong dependence of future
   sea-level change on ocean model resolution in simulations with a global
   climate model. The results indicate that, at least for the Caribbean
   Sea, adequate regional projections of sea-level change can only be
   obtained with ocean models which capture mesoscale processes.},

Abstract = {Invasive mammalian predators are major drivers of species extinctions
   globally. To protect native prey, lethal control is often used with the
   aim of reducing or exterminating invasive predator populations. The
   efficacy of this practice, however, is often not considered despite
   multiple practical and ecological factors that can limit success. Here,
   we summarize contemporary knowledge regarding the use and challenges of
   both lethal control and alternative approaches for reducing invasive
   predator impacts. As the prevailing management approach, we outline four
   key issues that can compromise the effectiveness of lethal control:
   release of herbivore and mesopredator populations, disruption of
   predator social systems, compensatory predator immigration, and ethical
   concerns. We then discuss the relative merits and limitations of four
   alternative approaches that may enhance conservation practitioner's
   ability to effectively manage invasive predators: top-predator
   conservation or reintroduction, maintaining habitat complexity,
   exclusion fencing, and behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Considerable
   uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of management approaches
   in different environmental contexts. We propose that the deficiencies
   and uncertainties outlined here can be addressed through a combination
   of adaptive management, expert elicitation, and cost-benefit analyses.
   Improved management of invasive predators requires greater consideration
   and assessment of the full range of management approaches available.},

Title = {Pathways for resilience to climate change in African cities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {African cities are largely less-built with agile informal settlements
   and multiple ecologies that harbor different pathways for resilience to
   climate change. We undertook a qualitative systematic review of academic
   and policy evidence, to address the question of what interventions are
   emerging at neigbourhood to city scale to enhance resilience to climate
   change in Africa. Resilience at neigbourhood scale often stems from
   harnessing the local resource base and technologies for urban
   agriculture and forestry; alternative energy from wastes; grassed
   drainages for protection against erosion; recreation along dry
   riverbeds; fog-water harvesting; and adjustments in irrigation
   schedules. At city scale, planning is targeted at buildings, mobility
   and energy service delivery as the objects to be made resilient. The
   review established that evidence on comparisons across regions is mainly
   on East, West and South African cities, and much less on cities in
   Northern and Central Africa. Ecological comparisons are majorly on
   coastal and inland cities, with minimal representation of semi-arid and
   mountainous cities. Resilience efforts in capital cities are the most
   dominant in the literature, with less emphasis on secondary cities and
   towns, which is necessary for a deeper understanding of the role played
   by inter-municipal and inter-metropolitan collaborations. African cities
   can bring context-sensitivity to global debates on climate resilience,
   if theoretical perspectives are generated from emerging interventions
   across case studies. We conclude with suggestions on what future
   research needs to take on, if evidence on resilience to climate change
   in African cities is to be strengthened.},

Abstract = {City revegetation strategies seem appealing to mitigate urban heat
   island effects through shading and transpirational cooling. Moreover,
   other potential benefits that may derive, e.g. biodiversity enhancement,
   the reduction in buildings energy consumption, stormwater management,
   acoustic insulation or air purification, earned them the designation
   `no-regrets approaches' for adapting to climate change. However, the
   lack of understanding and quantification of green infrastructures'
   environmental impacts prevents urban planning policies to be consistent
   and to turn attractive initiatives to effective implementations. The
   monitoring of existing green infrastructures is required to evaluate
   their cooling effect. For this purpose, an elastic gridshell in
   composite materials has been designed as a support for climbing plants
   at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech (Champs-sur-Marne, France). The life cycle
   assessment of the vegetated structure is performed in order to develop
   sustainable design strategies. Based on an energy balance approach, the
   collected thermo-hydric data can be used to determine which mechanisms
   are the most suitable for urban vegetation to enhance outdoor thermal
   comfort.},

Abstract = {Climate change and subsequent processes triggered by climate change
   demand novel assessments and protection schemes in coastal environments,
   as frequency and intensity of extreme events as well as mean sea water
   levels are expected to rise. Most often, conventional coastal
   engineering approaches are solely built for protection purposes, but
   often come with negative side-effects to the coastal environment and
   communities. During the last decade, new concepts in coastal engineering
   have started emerging. Several technical measures with an
   ecosystem-based design have been developed and, in some places, already
   implemented over the last decade. These low-regret measures, for
   instance green belts, coir fibers and porous submerged structures,
   reveal their full potential as stand-alone coastal protection or when
   used in combination with each other. They are believed - and in some
   cases documented - to be a better alternative or potential complement to
   conventional ``hard{''} coastal engineering protection. Concrete
   examples are taken from the densely populated coastal area of Jakarta
   Utara (North Jakarta) and the National Capital Integrated Coastal
   Development (NCICD), showing benefits and further opportunities, but
   also challenges for applied low-regret coastal protection measures and
   ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction. An assessment of the
   application potential of three ``soft{''} protection measures is given
   and discussed.},

Title = {A flexibility-based approach for the design and management of floating
   offshore wind farms},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Pages = {910-925},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Floating offshore wind farms have become a gateway to reach locations
   that are technically and economically infeasible to exploit using fixed
   platforms. However, the high capital investments and the uncertainty
   associated with the reliability, capacity factor, technology evolution,
   electricity demand, and regulatory frameworks negatively affect the cost
   of energy of this approach. Alternative strategies, such as designing
   for flexibility, have been shown to increase the value of engineering
   systems subject to highly uncertain environments. In this article, an
   analysis based on life-cycle costs and Monte-Carlo simulation is used to
   determine if floating wind farms with flexible installed capacity result
   in lower costs of energy than traditionally designed wind farms.
   Flexibility is introduced using an adaptable platform strategy and an
   over-dimensioned platform strategy. The results show that the adaptable
   platform strategy has the potential to reduce the cost of energy up to
   18\% by increasing the energy generation and the lifetime of some
   components of the wind farm. Nonetheless, the benefits of flexibility
   depend on new legislation that allows for lifetime extensions and proper
   flexibility management policies that utilize the potential built into
   the systems.

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic is a global shock that is significantly affecting
   coastal social-ecological systems (SES) in different parts of the world.
   Its widespread impacts have unravelled vulnerabilities in many aspects
   of society, including food systems. Our study investigated the impacts
   of a lockdown associated with the pandemic in the province of Bulacan,
   in the region of Central Luzon, Philippines, where aquaculture and
   capture fisheries are important and interconnected sectors. In
   particular, we focused on impacts related to production and market. We
   considered people's coping strategies and the factors that enabled such
   strategies. Our investigation adopted a case study approach and drew on
   qualitative data analysed through thematic analysis. The findings
   revealed differentiated mechanisms through which aquaculture and capture
   fisheries production were impacted. Both were strongly affected by
   market disruptions but through slightly different ways. In effect, the
   lockdown provided the impetus for the uptake and spreading of practices
   that were previously peripheral, particularly in relation to market
   exchanges. The study also identified a variety of coping strategies, as
   well as the importance of social support in the form of food aid,
   financial assistance, and institutional livelihood assistance. Finally,
   it discusses the importance of diversity in food sources, the role of
   local food systems, and governance implications for foregrounding
   social-ecological resilience in short-term response and long-term
   recovery.},

Abstract = {Enhancing the resilience of ecosystem services (ES) that underpin human
   well-being is critical for meeting current and future societal needs,
   and requires specific governance and management policies. Using the
   literature, we identify seven generic policy-relevant principles for
   enhancing the resilience of desired ES in the face of disturbance and
   ongoing change in social-ecological systems (SES). These principles are
   (P1) maintain diversity and redundancy, (P2) manage connectivity, (P3)
   manage slow variables and feedbacks, (P4) foster an understanding of SES
   as complex adaptive systems (CAS), (P5) encourage learning and
   experimentation, (P6) broaden participation, and (P7) promote
   polycentric governance systems. We briefly define each principle, review
   how and when it enhances the resilience of ES, and conclude with major
   research gaps. In practice, the principles often co-occur and are highly
   interdependent. Key future needs are to better understand these
   interdependencies and to operationalize and apply the principles in
   different policy and management contexts.},

Abstract = {How the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) would change in future is
   of broader scientific interest and critical for adaptation to climate
   change and sustainable development for the vulnerable population of the
   region. An Emergent Constraint (EC), to correct the projections of ISMR
   by the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project-6 (CMIP6) models for
   systematic model biases is urgently needed but has been lacking. Founded
   on an observed association between the multi-decadal variability (MDV)
   of ISMR and North Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperature (SST), here we
   unravel a strong correlation between future changes in ISMR and biases
   in simulating the present-day ISMR MDV. The new emergent constraint
   renders a 32\% reduction in the multi-model ensemble mean of projected
   ISMR increase, making the corrected future ISMR change (3.64 +/- 2.5)
   \%/K. The estimate based on this EC is robust and more reliable than
   previous estimates for basing policy interventions toward adaptation and
   mitigation.},

   associated with the combination of the many biophysical and
   socio-economic factors for resiliency and adaptation assessments across
   many disciplines on multiple spatial and temporal scales. This study
   applies a framework to quantitatively determine the multiple impacts of
   snowstorms by calculating the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) for
   four exposed freshwater lake communities in Canada's Northwest
   Territories using three contributing factors (exposure, sensitivity, and
   adaptive capacity). Results indicate that Deline is the most vulnerable
   community (0.67), because it has the highest exposure and one of the
   highest sensitivity ranks, while its ability to adapt to exposure
   stressors is the lowest among the communities. In contrast, Fort
   Resolution exhibits the lowest LVI (0.26) and has one of the highest
   adaptive capacities. This study emphasizes that while these freshwater
   communities may be exposed to snowstorms, they have different levels of
   sensitivity and adaptive capacities in place that influences their
   vulnerability to changes in hazardous snowfall conditions. The
   information gained from this study can help guide future adaptation,
   mitigation, and resiliency practices for Arctic sustainability efforts.},

Title = {Risk assessment for the sustainability of coastal communities: A
   preliminary study},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {671},
Pages = {339-350},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {With communities increasingly concentrated in coastal regions globally,
   governments and stakeholders call for cohesive risk assessments for
   future sustainability in the wake of natural hazards. This can only be
   achieved through risk-based decision-making and smart resources
   treatment. To provide a basis for such actions, we here propose a risk
   assessment (RA) framework focusing on the risk-resilience-sustainability
   nexus. In contrast to focusing on the traditional RA approach, we
   propose an integrative approach based on hazard, vulnerability, and
   resilience covering the full spectrum of RA for effective risk
   reduction. We further explain how the proposed framework can
   simultaneously provide useful input for resilience management in
   parallel to achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We
   apply this framework for typhoon risk assessment (represented by a
   Typhoon Risk Index-TRI) of coastal counties of mainland China. Different
   TRIs e.g. total population, elderly population, non-adult population,
   and economic status are calculated for each coastal county to supplement
   multi-objective empirical measures for risk reduction. The RA results
   show a large spatial heterogeneity in typhoon risk with an increase in
   the risk from north to south along the coast of mainland China. The
   comparative results from this study are relevant to the prioritization
   of different regions for immediate or gradual actions, wise
   decision-making, and risk reduction through proper treatment of
   resources-related policy implications. The evaluation of the SDGs
   achievement status reveals that the overall performance of coastal
   provinces in mainland China is higher to achieve SDGs 3 and 15 followed
   by 13 and 8. The study shows that while Guangdong province is in the
   highest risk category, its achievement status for SDG-13 (climate
   actions, strengthening resilience) is the lowest relative to other
   provinces, which is critical. This study represents a major scientific
   contribution to mainland China's coastal risk management and calls for
   aligning risk-informed planning and sustainability frameworks. (C) 2019

Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {58-67},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The past two decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st
   century have been characterized by global temperature rise and increased
   frequency of weather-induced extreme events such as heat and cold waves.
   Using mean daily meteorological observations from 1995 to 2014, the
   Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was used to detect heat and
   cold waves at 155 climate stations in Iran. Additionally, the
   acclimatization approach was introduced to evaluate human adaptation to
   interannual thermal perception. This paper, for the first time, uses PET
   and includes an analysis of consecutive days, as well as statistical
   filters to measure thermal adaptation of humans to extreme temperature
   events in Iran. This study presents a valuable first step for the
   quantification of cold waves and cold stress as well as heat waves and
   heat stress. Results showed that based on three thresholds resulting
   from different methods, no cold wave (CW) is observed in southwestern
   Iran and stations in the coastal strip of northern Persian Gulf and Oman
   Sea. Based on three thresholds, most frequent cold wave occurrence is
   observed for areas and highlands of North West, North East and the
   Zagros mountain range with different frequencies for different
   thresholds. Compared with cold wave, heat waves have been detected
   throughout the country. Although maximum threshold of the occurrence of
   this climate hazard occurs at Iran's southern coast, the most frequent
   occurrence was observed in boarder areas of eastern Iran. On the other
   hand, findings of the present study confirm the fact that the risk of
   heat waves in Iran is more serious than that of cold waves.},

Abstract = {Climatological records show a trend of the increasing occurrence of
   extreme weathers caused by global climate change. One form of extreme
   weathers is heavy rainfall which, combined with rising sea levels, made
   highways in some subtropical regions susceptible to flooding. Flooding
   in these regions causes noticeable damages to flexible highway
   pavements. However, little research has been conducted to quantify such
   damages and develop possible mitigation measures. This study developed a
   method to incorporate flood risk into the structural analysis of
   flexible pavements, examined the effects of flooding on pavement
   materials and structures through laboratory tests and design
   simulations, and recommended better pavement design and management
   strategies. Flexible pavement is found to be significantly affected by
   flooding. Future climate change and the resultant increase of flooding
   frequency pose a serious challenge to the reliability of flexible
   highway pavements. To mitigate the detrimental effects of flooding,
   pavement thickness and drainage system need to be adequately designed
   and post-flood traffic control may need to be imposed.},

Abstract = {This study examines spatially referenced perceived landscape values and
   climate change risks collected through public participation geographic
   information systems for potential use in climate change planning. Using
   survey data from the Southern Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia, we
   present a method for identifying perceived landscape values and climate
   change risks to describe and quantify their spatial associations. Two
   spatial data models-vector and raster-and two analytical methods-Jaccard
   coefficients and spatial cross-correlations were used to describe the
   spatial associations. Results indicate that perceptions of climate
   change risk are driven, in part, by the values people assign or hold for
   places on the landscape. Biodiversity and intrinsic landscape values
   have strong spatial association with biodiversity loss risk while
   recreation values have strong spatial association with riparian
   flooding, sea-level rise and wave action risks. Other landscape values
   show weak to no spatial association with perceived climate change risks.
   The methodology described in this research provides a mechanism for
   government agencies to develop place-based adaptation strategies based
   on these associations.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {265-281},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Short-term temperature effects on respiration and photosynthesis were
   investigated in intact diatom-dominated benthic communities, collected
   at 2 temperate and 1 high-arctic subtidal sites. Areal rates of total
   (TOE) and diffusive (DOE) O-2 exchange were determined from
   O-2-microsensor measurements in intact sediment cores in the temperature
   range from 0 to 24degreesC in darkness and at 140 mumol photons m(-2)
   s(-1). In darkness, the O-2 Consumption increased exponentially with
   increasing temperature for both TOE and DOE, and no optimum temperature
   was observed within the applied temperature range. Q(10) was calculated
   from the linear slope in Arrhenius plots and ranged between 1.7 and 3.3
   at the respective sites. The volume-specific rate (R-dark,R-vol) solely
   representing the biological temperature response was somewhat stronger,
   with Q(10) values of 2.6 to 5.2. The Q(10) values were overall not
   correlated to the in situ water temperature or geographical position.
   Accordingly, no difference in the temperature acclimation or adaptation
   strategy of the microbial community was observed. Slurred oxic sediment
   samples showed a Q10 of 1.7 and were, hence, lower than estimates based
   on intact sediment core measurements. This can be ascribed to changes in
   physical and biological controls during resuspension. Gross
   photosynthesis was measured with the light-dark shift method at the 2
   temperate sites. Both areal (P-gross) and volumetric (P-gross,P-vol)
   rates increased with temperature to an optimum temperature at 12 and
   15degreesC, with a Q(10) for P-gross of 2.2 and 2.6 for the 2 sites,
   respectively. The gross photosynthesis response could be categorised as
   psychrotrophic for both sites and no temperature adaptation was observed
   between the 2 sites. Our measurements document that temperature
   stimulates heterotrophic activity more than gross photosynthesis, and
   that the benthic communities gradually become heterotrophic with
   increasing temperature. This has implications for C-cycling in shallow
   water communities experiencing seasonal and diel temperature
   fluctuations.},

Title = {Coastal multi-hazard vulnerability assessment along the Ganges deltaic
   coast of Bangladesh-A geospatial approach},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It is ironic that countries that are least responsible for or
   insignificant contributors to global climate change, are in fact, the
   most susceptible to its harmful impact. The Ganges deltaic coast, one of
   the largest sediment depocentres with the 286 km long coastline of
   Bangladesh, faces potentially multi-hazard threat due to climatic
   change. This study attempted to develop a coastal vulnerability index
   (CVI) by using seven physical parameters namely: (a) geomorphology; (b)
   coastal slope; (c) shoreline change rate; (d) rate of sea level change;
   (e) mean tide range; (f) bathymetry; and (g) storm surge height. These
   variables are considered as relative risk parameters and integrated
   through geospatial techniques (i.e., remote sensing and GIS), and then
   ranked to estimate the degree of coastline vulnerability to sea level
   rise. The entire coastline is ranked in accordance with multi-hazard
   vulnerability and the results reveal that 20.1\% of the shoreline (57.9
   km of total coastline in the Ganges delta) is very highly vulnerable,
   whilst 17.5\% of shoreline (50.0 km) is estimated to be highly
   vulnerable. In contrast, 21.5\% of the entire shoreline (61.3 km) is
   moderately vulnerable, whereas approximately 56.6 km (19.7\%) and 60.4
   km (21.2\%) of the total shorelines are in low and very low
   vulnerability categories, respectively. The results of the CVI are
   expected to provide a clear picture for predicting future recession of
   shorelines; hence the outcome of this study can be used as an important
   tool by coastal managers for developing sustainable resources management
   practices. Furthermore, this study also offers a framework for
   prioritizing actions to enhance a community's resilience or to assist in
   developing appropriate adaptive measures as part of disaster risk
   reduction initiative. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   We analyze and describe two performances developed as part of a project
   exploring people's resilience to extreme weather events and to coastal

   devising the performance, which used various elicitation techniques to
   examine what matters to people in times of change and how people are
   able to respond to changes now and in the future. We discuss how
   creative practices such as participatory drama may contribute to the
   understanding of resilience, challenge assumptions, and bring new
   perspectives. Finally, we discuss how participatory drama informs
   action- and solutions-oriented work around resilience, poverty, and

Title = {Assessment of Socio-Economic and Climate Change Impacts on Water
   Resources in Four European Lagoon Catchments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {6},
Pages = {701-720},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study demonstrates the importance of considering potential land use
   and management changes in climate impact research. By taking into
   account possible trends of economic development and environmental
   awareness, we assess effects of global warming on water availability and
   quality in the catchments of four European lagoons: Ria de Aveiro
   (Portugal), Mar Menor (Spain), Vistula Lagoon (Poland and Russia), and
   Tyligulskyi Liman (Ukraine). Different setups of the process-based soil
   and water integrated model (SWIM), representing one reference and four
   socio-economic scenarios for each study area: the ``business as
   usual{''}, ``crisis{''}, ``managed horizons{''}, and ``set-aside{''}
   scenarios are driven by sets of 15 climate scenarios for a reference
   (1971-2000) and near future (2011-2040) scenario period. Modeling
   results suggest a large spatial variability of potential impacts across
   the study areas, due to differences in the projected precipitation
   trends and the current environmental and socio-economic conditions.
   While climate change may reduce water and nutrients input to the Ria de
   Aveiro and Tyligulsyi Liman and increase water inflow to the Vistula
   Lagoon the socio-economic scenarios and their implications may balance
   out or reverse these trends. In the intensely managed Mar Menor
   catchment, climate change has no notable direct impact on water
   resources, but changes in land use and water management may certainly
   aggravate the current environmental problems. The great heterogeneity
   among results does not allow formulating adaptation or mitigation
   measures at pan-European level, as initially intended by this study. It
   rather implies the need of a regional approach in coastal zone
   management.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Saltwater intrusion (SWI) is a global coastal problem caused by aquifer
   overpumping, land-use change, and climate change impacts. Given the
   complex pathways that lead to SWI, coastal urban areas with poorly
   monitored aquifers are in need of probabilistic-based decision support
   tools that can assist in better understanding and predicting SWI, while
   exploring effective means for sustainable aquifer management. In this
   study, we develop a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to account for the
   complex interactions of climatic and anthropogenic processes leading to
   SWI, while relating the severity of SWI to associated socioeconomic
   impacts and possible adaptation strategies. The BBN is further expanded
   into a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to assess the temporal progression
   of SWI and account for the compounding uncertainties over time. The
   proposed DBN is then tested at a pilot coastal aquifer underlying a
   highly urbanized water-stressed metropolitan area along the Eastern
   Mediterranean coastline (Beirut, Lebanon). The results show that the
   future impacts of climate change are largely secondary when compared to
   the persistent water deficits. While both supply and demand management
   could halt the progression of salinity, the potential for reducing or
   reversing SWI is not evident. The indirect socioeconomic burden
   associated with aquifer salinity was observed to improve, albeit
   heterogeneously, with the application of various adaptation strategies;
   however, this was at a cost associated with the implementation and
   operation of these strategies. The proposed DBN acts as an effective
   decision support tool that can promote sustainable aquifer management in
   coastal regions through its robust representation of the main drivers of
   SWI and linking them to expected socioeconomic burdens and management
   options. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;00:1-19. (c) 2020 SETAC},

Number = {12},

Abstract = {Whether a journey is pleasant or not usually depends on the climatic
   conditions which permit to perform outdoor activities. The perception of
   climatic conditions, determined by physiological and psychological
   factors, can vary according to different adaptation phenomena related to
   the person involved and the weather conditions of the place where they
   live. Studying the bioclimatology of a country characterized by a high
   flux of tourism, as e.g. Italy, can provide some important information
   about where and when is it better to visit a place. Some differences
   have to be specified though, like the local tourism, which is used to
   that type of climate, and international tourism, which is formed by
   people coming from countries with different types of climates. Therefore
   this paper examined the climatic conditions and outdoor thermal comfort
   through the Mediterranean Outdoor Comfort Index (MOCI) for local tourism
   and through the predicted mean vote (PMV) for international tourism. The
   cities examined were three (Venice, Rome and Palermo located in the
   North, Centre and South of Italy, respectively), where average
   information were collected every week for an entire year. Finally, a map
   of the entire Italian territory reporting the seasonal average values of
   these indexes was also reported.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {1559-1571},

Abstract = {In the Lesser Antilles, coastal inundations from hurricane-induced storm
   surges pose a great threat to lives, properties and ecosystems.
   Assessing current and future storm surge hazards with sufficient spatial
   resolution is of primary interest to help coastal planners and decision
   makers develop mitigation and adaptation measures. Here, we use
   wave-current numerical models and statistical methods to investigate
   worst case scenarios and 100-year surge levels for the case study of
   Martinique under present climate or considering a potential sea level
   rise. Results confirm that the wave setup plays a major role in the
   Lesser Antilles, where the narrow island shelf impedes the piling-up of
   large amounts of wind-driven water on the shoreline during extreme
   events. The radiation stress gradients thus contribute significantly to
   the total surge - up to 100\% in some cases. The nonlinear interactions
   of sea level rise (SLR) with bathymetry and topography are generally
   found to be relatively small in Martinique but can reach several tens of
   centimeters in low-lying areas where the inundation extent is strongly
   enhanced compared to present conditions. These findings further
   emphasize the importance of waves for developing operational storm surge
   warning systems in the Lesser Antilles and encourage caution when using
   static methods to assess the impact of sea level rise on storm surge
   hazard.},

Abstract = {US national wildlife refuges have recent, detailed management plans
   illustrating the state of planning for climate-change adaptation in
   protected areas. Discussion of and prescriptions for addressing climate
   change increased in refuge plans between 2005 and 2010 but decreased in
   2011. The plans respond to some climate-change impacts on biodiversity
   and call for monitoring but with little clarity regarding how to act on
   monitoring results and scant attention to future changes in phenology
   and community composition. The threats posed by sea-level rise generated
   the best-developed plan prescriptions. Examples of excellent
   prescriptions provide models for future planning. Some decision-support
   tools, such as vulnerability assessments, will improve future planning
   as they become more available. However, research better targeted at
   management information gaps is also needed. Region-level coordination,
   such as through landscape conservation design, offers opportunities for
   enlarging conservation footprints and improving information generation
   and sharing.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the CONSCIENCE project was to develop and test
   concepts, guidelines and tools for the sustainable management of erosion
   along the European coastline, based on the best available scientific
   knowledge and on existing practical experience. Four concepts are
   potentially capable of providing the nexus between scientific knowledge
   and management: coastal resilience, coastal sediment cell, favourable
   sediment status and strategic sediment reservoir. The project has tested
   the use of these concepts and found that they are useful, provided that
   they are positioned and linked within a logical structure that we shall
   call the CONSCIENCE ``Frame of Reference{''}, defined in time and space
   and supported through data and monitoring. Practical experience in six
   coastal sites in Europe has shown that the use of this Frame of
   Reference together with these concepts can make management objectives
   explicit and transparent. It can therefore support the design of an
   appropriate, resilience based coastal erosion management practice. (C)

Title = {Carbon storage in a restored mangrove forest in Can Gio Mangrove Forest
   Park, Mekong Delta, Vietnam},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {380},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests are considered to be the most important carbon (C) sink
   in the tropics. Evaluation of ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove
   forests will provide important information for management and
   conservation practices, climate change mitigation strategies and
   reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+)
   schemes. Despite this, a gap remains in the understanding of ecosystem C
   storage in Can Gio Mangrove Forest Park (CGM), the largest restored
   mangrove forest area in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. In the present study,
   ecosystem C storage was quantified in CGM in growing mangrove forests, a
   typhoon disturbed forest, and a mudflat by measuring the biomass of
   trees, roots, downed woody debris, sediment organic C, and overall
   depth. The mean above-ground C storage was 102 +/- 24.7, 298.1 +/- 14.1
   and 243.6 +/- 40.4 MgC ha(-1) for fringe, transition, and interior
   forests, respectively. The high above- and below-ground C stocks
   resulted in high ecosystem C storage, ranging from 765 to 1026 MgC
   ha(-1), with an overall mean of 910.7 +/- 32.3 MgC ha(-1). The ecosystem
   C storage of the typhoon disturbed forest and mudflat was less than that
   of mangrove forests, with values of 573.5 MgC hat and 619.8 +/- 24.3 MgC
   ha(-1), respectively. At the regional scale, CGM can store up to 41.5 Tg
   C, which is equivalent to 152.3 Tg of CO(2)e. The results of the present
   study suggest that mangrove restoration and conservation are effective
   tools for enhancing C storage and offsetting C emissions at both
   regional and national scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   They include structural, process/response and scale problems. A
   conventional classification of dune landscapes which is relevant for
   dune management is used to describe the characteristics of dune
   landscapes. Some dune landscapes do not fit in with this classification
   because they depend on special factors: topography, past climate or

   climate change are discussed, ending with some geomorphology-oriented
   mitigation measures.},

Title = {Coastal Risk Cultures: Local and Regional Formation of Knowledge and
   Action},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {This paper deals with how culture is expressed through the interplay of
   socially, politically, and economically driven processes and practices
   in place-based biophysical contexts as well as the role played by
   narrative expressions in the formation of coastal risk management,
   knowledge and action. It draws upon ethnographic, comparative, and
   historical approaches to understand how culture frames what we know and
   how we respond differently to risks. The research is based on the
   theoretical position that interpretation of risks and responses of
   social groups are shaped by frames of cultural knowledge and values, and
   investigates the influence resident's values have in shaping the
   resilience of their community in two coastal regions in Germany and
   Italy. Information was derived from desk research, semi-structured,
   narrative interviews, and observation. Specifically, the author was
   interested in how residents' views and narratives affected their risk
   behavior, shaped their needs and which role path dependencies and
   societal contexts played in the formation of risk knowledge, risk
   management and action. The author found that values, knowledge and
   identity highly matter in building community resilience. Moreover, the
   cases illustrate how past and present societal trajectories shape local
   and regional responses to climate change and why this concerns political
   decision makers at all levels, who are aiming to mainstream mitigation
   and adaptation strategies confronting climate change effects and in turn
   shaping resilience at local and regional levels.},

Title = {Tidal Marsh Restoration Design Affects Feedbacks Between Inundation and
   Elevation Change},
Journal = {ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Tidal marsh (re)creation on formerly embanked land is increasingly
   executed along estuaries and coasts in Europe and the USA, either by
   restoring complete or by reduced tidal exchange. Ecosystem functioning
   and services are largely affected by the hydro-geomorphologic
   development of these areas. For natural marshes, the latter is known to
   be steered by feedbacks between tidal inundation and sediment accretion,
   allowing marshes to reach and maintain an equilibrium elevation relative
   to the mean sea level. However, for marsh restoration sites, these
   feedbacks may be disturbed depending on the restoration design. This was
   investigated by comparing the inundation-elevation change feedbacks in a
   natural versus restoration site with reduced tidal exchange in the
   Scheldt estuary (Belgium). This study analyzes long-term (9 years)
   datasets on elevation change and tidal inundation properties to
   disentangle the different mechanisms behind this elevation-inundation
   feedback. Moreover, subsequent changes in sediment properties that may
   affect this feedback were explored. In the restoration area with reduced
   tidal exchange, we found a different elevation-inundation feedback than
   on natural marshes, which is a positive feedback on initially high sites
   (i.e., sediment accretion leads to increasing inundation, hence causing
   accelerating sediment accretion rates) and a gradual silting up of the
   whole area. Furthermore, there is evidence for the presence of a relict
   consolidated sediment layer. Consequently, shallow subsidence is less
   likely to occur. Although short-term ecological development of the tidal
   marsh was not impeded, long-term habitat development may be affected by
   the differences in hydro-geomorphological interactions. An increase of
   inundation frequency on the initially high sites may cause inhibition of
   habitat succession or even reversed succession. Over time, the climax
   state of the restoration area may be different compared to natural
   marshes. Moreover, sediment-related ecosystem services, such as nutrient
   and carbon burial, may be positively influenced because of continuing
   sedimentation, although flood water storage potential will decrease with
   increasing elevation. Depending on the restoration goals, ecosystem
   trajectories and delivery of ecosystem services can be controlled by
   adaptive management of the tidal volume entering the restoration area.},

Title = {Quantifying Coral Reef Resilience to Climate Change and Human
   Development: An Evaluation of Multiple Empirical Frameworks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {The integrity of coral reefs has increasingly been threatened by human
   development and climate change. As a result, the concept of ecological
   resilience - an ecosystem's capability to resist and recover from
   environmental stressors - has become an important aspect of coral reef
   conservation. In this study, coral reef resilience was quantitatively
   scored in Kenting National Park (KNP), Taiwan, using four different
   assessment frameworks: the first uses the opinions of local reef
   experts, the second includes metrics specific to the local reef context,
   the third combines the previous two approaches, and the fourth relies
   solely on ecological metrics from biodiversity surveys. To evaluate the
   accuracy of each assessment, the resulting resilience scores were
   compared with historical coral recovery rates, which served as a proxy
   for resilience. While each approach to measuring resilience has its
   merits and drawbacks, the picture of resilience became clearest when a
   few key indicators were included to reflect core ecosystem processes.
   Trends in resilience scores varied depending on the makeup of the
   assessment's indicators, and there was little correlation between the
   baseline metrics measured using different data collection methods.
   However, all resilience assessment trends indicated that KNP's Nanwan
   area is high in resilience. This is likely due to the effects of local
   tidally-induced upwelling, which significantly relieve the growing
   thermal stress placed on surrounding coral communities. Ultimately, the
   most successful assessments were those that empirically quantified
   ecological processes and local factors with only a few indicators,
   rather than broader approaches that measured many indicators. These
   findings are particularly relevant for reef managers to consider as they
   develop and employ resilience-based management strategies.},

Title = {Nature-Based Solutions in Coastal and Estuarine Areas of Europe},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Momentum for sustainable and climate resilience solutions for coastal
   protection are growing globally given the pressing need to prevent
   further loss of biodiversity and ecosystems while meeting the climate
   change adaptation and mitigation goals. Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)
   represent an opportunity to align environmental and resilience goals, at
   a time of strained budgets in a global context and when short-term needs
   may run counter to long-term goals. In Europe, NbS fit the mandates of
   major EU environmental and climate change policies by restoring
   biodiversity and enhancing climate-resilience and carbon sequestration.
   Previous studies have compiled scientific evidence about
   hydro-meteorological hazards for the use of NbS. However, their
   implementation at scale is still lacking. As the knowledge and
   experience with NbS for adaptation to natural hazards and climate change
   increases, it becomes more important to draw lessons learned and
   insights for replicating and scaling up NbS, especially in coastal areas
   where their implementation is still limited compared to other
   environments. This study analyzed NbS case studies across European
   coastal and estuarine areas to draw key lessons, understand better the
   current status of implementation, and identify key challenges and gaps.
   From a total of 59 NbS case studies associated with flooding, erosion
   and biodiversity loss, results show an increase in NbS implementation
   since 1990s, but most rapidly between 2005 and 2015. Most of the case
   studies are hybrid solutions employing wetlands, predominantly located
   in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands. Funding of NbS is
   largely from public sources, and rarely come from a single or a private
   source. Three-quarters of the case studies reported monitoring
   activities, but more than half did not disclose quantitative results
   related to effectiveness against flooding and/or erosion. The need to
   improve coastal defenses was indicated as the main motivation for NbS
   implementation over traditional structures, while sustainability was the
   most mentioned additional reason. Although a variety of co-benefits and
   lessons learned was identified, clearer descriptions and enhanced
   details of such information are required. There is a need for tools and
   strategies to expand knowledge sharing of lessons learned to enable
   further replication of successful cases in other areas.},

Abstract = {Many environmental science research programmes now adopt community-based
   philosophies and designs, although there are few applications in
   Australian Indigenous communities. This research describes the
   development and testing of a framework of engagement to guide
   collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians during
   an environmental sciences research project. That project aimed to assess
   trepang (sea cucumber) stocks in Aboriginal waters, and determine the
   commercial harvest potential of the resource to local people. Its
   objectives were to undertake trepang survey and mapping, integrate
   Indigenous knowledge about the resource, and model the existing catch
   data of commercial fishers operating in the region. The framework of
   engagement developed to guide the research process comprised a goal,
   research stages, and a number of guiding principles for collaboration,
   which were constructed from content analysis of available guidelines and
   literature and from data gathered during expert interviews. Further data
   were gathered using participant observation, while implementing the
   trepang research in accordance with this framework of engagement, and
   these data were analysed to test and evaluate the framework. Findings
   indicate discursive and reflective approaches such as action research or
   adaptive management may better facilitate equitable research

Title = {A review of climate change and the implementation of marine biodiversity
   legislation in the United Kingdom},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {1. Marine legislation, the key means by which the conservation of marine
   biodiversity is achieved, has been developing since the 1960s. In recent
   decades, an increasing focus on `holistic' policy development is
   evident, compared with earlier `piecemeal' sectoral approaches.
   Important marine legislative tools being used in the United Kingdom, and
   internationally, include the designation of marine protected areas and
   the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) with its aim of meeting
   `Good Environmental Status' (GES) for European seas by 2020.
   2. There is growing evidence of climate change impacts on marine
   biodiversity, which may compromise the effectiveness of any legislation
   intended to promote sustainable marine resource management.
   3. A review of key marine biodiversity legislation relevant to the UK
   shows climate change was not considered in the drafting of much early
   legislation. Despite the huge increase in knowledge of climate change
   impacts in recent decades, legislation is still limited in how it takes
   these impacts into account. There is scope, however, to account for
   climate change in implementing much of the legislation through (a)
   existing references to environmental variability; (b) review cycles; and
   (c) secondary legislation and complementary policy development.
   4. For legislation relating to marine protected areas (e.g. the EC
   Habitats and Birds Directives), climate change has generally not been
   considered in the site-designation process, or for ongoing management,
   with the exception of the Marine (Scotland) Act. Given that changing
   environmental conditions (e.g. rising temperatures and ocean
   acidification) directly affect the habitats and species that sites are
   designated for, how this legislation is used to protect marine
   biodiversity in a changing climate requires further consideration.
   5. Accounting for climate change impacts on marine biodiversity in the
   development and implementation of legislation is vital to enable timely,
   adaptive management responses. Marine modelling can play an important
   role in informing management decisions. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {We have reviewed the effects of long-term climatic/oceanic conditions on
   the growth, survival, production dynamics, and distribution of Hokkaido
   chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta in Japan during the period 1945-2005 using
   path analysis, back-calculation, and scale analyses, and applied a
   prediction method based on the SRES-A1B scenario of the
   intergovernmental panel on climate change. The populations of Hokkaido
   chum salmon were found to have had high growth rates at age 1 year since
   the late 1980s. Path analysis indicated that the growth at age 1 year in
   the Okhotsk Sea was directly affected by warm sea surface temperature
   associated with global warming, with the increased growth at age 1 year
   resulting in higher rates of survival and large population sizes.
   Predictions on the global warming effects on the chum salmon were (1)
   decreased carrying capacity and distribution area, (2) occurrence of a
   strong density-dependent effect, and (3) loss of migration route to the
   Sea of Okhotsk, especially for Hokkaido chum salmon. We have also
   outlined the future challenges of establishing a sustainable
   conservation management scheme for salmon that include adaptive
   management and precautionary principles, as well as conservation of
   natural spawning populations and recovery of natural river ecosystems in
   Japan despite the warming climate.},

Title = {Better integration of sectoral planning and management approaches for
   the interlinked ecology of the open oceans},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {127-136},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Open oceans are one of the least protected, least studied and most
   inadequately managed ecosystems on Earth. Three themes were investigated
   that differentiate the open ocean (areas beyond national jurisdiction
   and deep area within exclusive economic zones) from other realms and
   must be considered when developing planning and management options:
   ecosystem interactions, especially between benthic and pelagic systems;
   potential effects of human activities in open oceans on ecological
   linkages; and policy context and options. A number of key ecological
   factors differentiate open oceans from coastal systems for planners and
   managers: (1) many species are widely distributed and, especially for
   those at higher trophic levels, wide ranging; (2) the sizes and
   boundaries of biogeographical domains (patterns of co-occurrence of
   species, habitats and ecosystem processes) vary significantly by depth;
   (3) habitat types exhibit a wide range of stabilities, from ephemeral
   (e.g., surface frontal systems) to hyper-stable (e.g., deep sea); and
   (4) vertical and horizontal linkages are prevalent. Together, these
   ecological attributes point to interconnectedness between open ocean
   habitats across large spatial scales. Indeed, human activities -
   especially fishing, shipping, and potentially deep-sea mining and oil
   and gas extraction - have effects far beyond the parts of the ocean in
   which they operate. While managing open oceans in an integrated fashion
   will be challenging, the ecological characteristics of the system demand
   it. A promising avenue forward is to integrate aspects of marine spatial
   planning (MSP), systematic conservation planning (SCP), and adaptive
   management. These three approaches to planning and management need to be
   integrated to meet the unique needs of open ocean systems, with MSP
   providing the means to meet a diversity of stakeholder needs, SCP
   providing the structured process to determine and prioritise those needs

Abstract = {In the Netherlands awareness regarding the Urban Heat Island (UHI) was
   raised relatively recently. Because of this recent understanding, there
   is a lack of consistent urban micro-meteorological measurements to allow
   a conventional UHI assessment of Dutch cities during heat waves. This
   paper argues that it is possible to retrieve relevant UHI
   information-including adaptation guidelines-from satellite imagery.
   The paper comprises three parts. The first part consists of a study of
   suited indicators to identify urban heat islands from which a method is
   presented based on ground heat flux mapping. The second part proposes
   heat mitigation strategies and identifies the areas where these
   strategies could be applied within the hotspots identified in the cities
   of The Hague, Delft, Leiden, Gouda, Utrecht and Den Bosch. The third
   part estimates the reduction of urban heat generated by the increase of
   roof albedo in the hotspots of the six cities. The six cities hotspots
   are located within the boundaries of the seventeenth century city
   centres. In order to avoid interference with cultural values of these
   historical environments most likely UHI mitigation measures regard
   improving the thermal behaviour of the city roofs. For instance,
   applying white coatings on bitumen flat roofs (or replacing them by
   white singleply membranes) and replacing sloped roof clay tiles by
   coloured tiles with cool pigments can reduce the urban heat hotspots by
   approximately 1.5 degrees C.
   Remote sensing provides high level information that provide urban
   planners and policy makers with overall design guidelines for the
   reduction of urban heat.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a suite of analytics that are proposed to be
   embedded in next-generation smart sensors in electric power grids. The
   proposed analytics take the electrical signals as the input and unlock
   the full potential in signal processing and machine learning for
   real-time event detection and classification. Meanwhile, a robust
   synchrophasor estimation mechanism is housed within the proposed sensor
   technology that will be triggered following a detected event and guides
   on the adaptive selection of the best-fit (most accurate) synchrophasor
   estimation algorithms at all times. Embedding such analytics within the
   sensor and closer to where the waveforms are captured, the proposed
   distributed intelligence solution technology mitigates the potential
   risks to communication failures and latencies as well as malicious cyber
   threats. Our experiments demonstrate that the introduced scheme achieves
   improved quality of measurements with a promising event detection and
   classification accuracy, collectively resulting in enhanced online
   situational awareness in modern power grids.},

Title = {Observed and Projected Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Fisheries,
   Aquaculture, Coastal Tourism, and Human Health: An Update},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment
   Report (AR5) states that climate change and ocean acidification are
   altering the oceans at a rate that is unprecedented compared with the
   recent past, leading to multifaceted impacts on marine ecosystems,
   associated goods and services, and human societies. AR5 underlined key
   uncertainties that remain regarding how synergistic changes in the ocean
   are likely to affect human systems, and how humans are likely to respond
   to these events. As climate change research has accelerated rapidly
   following AR5, an updated synthesis of available knowledge is necessary
   to identify emerging evidence, and to thereby better inform policy
   discussions. This paper reviews the literature to capture corroborating,
   conflicting, and novel findings published following the cut-off date for
   contribution to AR5. Specifically, we highlight key scientific
   developments on the impacts of climate-induced changes in the ocean on
   key socioeconomic sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, and
   tourism. New evidence continues to support a climate-induced
   redistribution of benefits and losses at multiple scales and across
   coastal and marine socio-ecological systems, partly resulting from
   species and ecosystem range shifts and changes in primary productivity.
   New efforts have been made to characterize and value ecosystem services
   in the context of climate change, with specific relevance to
   ecosystem-based adaptation. Recent studies have also explored
   synergistic interactions between climatic drivers, and have found strong
   variability between impacts on species at different life stages.
   Although climate change may improve conditions for some types of
   freshwater aquaculture, potentially providing alternative opportunities
   to adapt to impacts on wild capture fisheries, ocean acidification poses
   a risk to shellfish fisheries and aquaculture. The risk of increased
   prevalence of disease under warmer temperatures is uncertain, and may
   detrimentally affect human health. Climate change may also induce
   changes in tourism flows, leading to substantial geospatial shifts in
   economic costs and benefits associated with tourism revenue and coastal
   infrastructure protection and repairs. While promising, ecosystem based
   coastal adaptation approaches are still emerging, and require an
   improved understanding of key ecosystem services, and values for coastal
   and build decision communities in order to assess risk, aid coastal
   development planning, support systems.},

Abstract = {Significant advances have been made to understand the interrelationship
   between humans and the environment in recent years, yet research has not
   produced useful localized estimates that link population forecasts to
   environmental change. Coarse, static population estimates that have
   little information on projected growth or spatial variability mask
   substantial impacts of environmental change on especially vulnerable
   populations. We estimate that 20 million people in the United States
   will be affected by sea-level rise by 2030 in selected regions that
   represent a range of sociodemographic characteristics and corresponding
   risks of vulnerability. Our results show that the impact of sea-level
   rise extends beyond the directly impacted counties due to migration
   networks that link inland and coastal areas and their populations.
   Substantial rates of population growth and migration are serious
   considerations for developing mitigation, adaptation, and planning
   strategies, and for future research on the social, demographic, and
   political dimensions of climate change.},

Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries are an important source of livelihoods,
   particularly among poor coastal populations. To improve fisheries'
   condition and maximize their contribution to human welfare,
   co-management approaches have proliferated worldwide. In this article,
   we conduct a systematic review of academic literature to examine the
   context and attributes of co-management initiatives in small-scale
   fisheries, and their expected outcomes. The review suggests that a
   supporting legal and institutional framework facilitates the emergence
   of co-management, because it contributes to clarify and legitimize
   property rights over fish resources. It is also found that co-management
   delivers both ecological and social benefits: it increases the abundance
   and habitat of species, fish catches, actors' participation, and the
   fishery's adaptive capacity, as well as it induces processes of social
   learning. Furthermore, co-management is more effective if artisanal
   fishers and diverse stakeholders become involved through an adaptive
   institutional framework. However, the review also suggests that more
   research is needed to discern when co-management initiatives can
   transform pre-existing conflicts, challenge power asymmetries and
   distribute benefits more equitably.},

   increase mitigation action over time. Countries put forward pledges
   called nationally determined contributions (NDC) whose impact is
   assessed in global stocktaking exercises. Subsequently, actions can then
   be strengthened in light of the Paris climate objective: limiting global
   mean temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C and pursuing efforts
   to limit it further to 1.5 degrees C. However, pledged actions are
   currently described ambiguously and this complicates the global
   stocktaking exercise. Here, we systematically explore possible
   interpretations of NDC assumptions, and show that this results in
   estimated emissions for 2030 ranging from 47 to 63 GtCO(2)e yr(-1). We
   show that this uncertainty has critical implications for the feasibility
   and cost to limit warming well below 2 degrees C and further to 1.5
   degrees C. Countries are currently working towards clarifying the
   modalities of future NDCs. We identify salient avenues to reduce the
   overall uncertainty by about 10 percentage points through simple,
   technical clarifications regarding energy accounting rules. Remaining
   uncertainties depend to a large extent on politically valid choices
   about how NDCs are expressed, and therefore raise the importance of a
   thorough and robust process that keeps track of where emissions are
   heading over time.},

Abstract = {Coastal vulnerability assessment is essential in formulating strategies
   to reduce adverse impacts of climate change. Thus, this study was
   conducted to help local government units (LGUs) and other concerned
   agencies and communities to identify priority areas for disaster risk
   reduction and management in the province of Davao del Norte,
   Philippines. It measures the degree of sensitivity, exposure and
   adaptive capacity of coastal resources in all coastal areas in the
   province using the Coastal Integrated Vulnerability Assessment Tool
   (CIVAT) adopted from Marine and Resources Foundation, Inc. (MERF). The
   study revealed that there were six natural disturbances of coastal
   areas. These include heavy rainfall, tropical cyclone, El Nino, flood,
   coastal erosion, and strong wind or habagat. Majority of the coastal
   areas were moderately exposed, sensitive, and adaptive to adverse
   impacts of natural hazards. In general, coastal areas in the province
   were moderately vulnerable to natural hazards except for Barangay
   Dadatan in Island Garden City of Samal (IGCS), which was highly
   vulnerable. In terms of prioritization for disaster risk reduction and
   management interventions, barangays Tambo, Ballet, San Isidro,
   Tagpopangan, San Miguel, La Suerte Lapaz, Pangubatan, Poblacion
   Kaputian, Tagbaobo, Taba, JP Laurel, San Jose, Tagbay,
   Poblacion-Libertad, and Aumbay should highly be prioritized.},

Abstract = {Rapidly changing ocean conditions pose substantial challenges for
   coastal communities, fishermen, and managers. From 2014 to 2016, the
   Gulf of Alaska (GOA) experienced a marine heatwave and corollary decline
   in Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus). Here, we explore the 2020 closure
   of the directed Pacific cod federal fishery in the GOA as a case study
   of the needs and opportunities for managing fisheries in the context of
   environmental change. We build on climate-ready fishery research and
   conversations with experienced commercial fishermen, including Alutiiq
   fishers, and fishery managers to: (i) discuss ecosystem-based management
   in Alaska, (ii) explore early warning signs and management challenges
   preceding the decline of Pacific cod, (iii) recommend tools to enhance
   adaptive capacity in fishery management. We conclude that a strong
   foundation of science-based management that incorporates ecosystem
   information and multiple ways of knowing, increased monitoring and
   evaluation of indicators, and new tools for managers to respond and
   adapt will be essential to sustainable fishery management. New
   mechanisms highlighted in this essay include: a GOA Fishery Ecosystem
   Plan, climate risk and vulnerability analyses, habitat protections, and
   the development of original metrics, such as food web production or
   function targets to inform stock assessments and fishery management.},

Abstract = {Sustainable landslide mitigation requires appropriate approaches to
   predict susceptible zones. This study compared the performance of
   Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Random Forest (RF) and Naive-Bayes Tree (NBT)
   in predicting landslide susceptibility for the upper Nyabarongo
   catchment (Rwanda). 196 past landslides were mapped using field
   investigations. Thus, the inventory map was split into training and
   testing datasets. Fifteen predisposing factors were analysed and
   information gain (IG) technique was used to analyse the correlation
   between factors and observed landslides. Therefore, the area under
   receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) with other statistical
   estimators including accuracy, precision, and root mean square error
   (RMSE) were employed to compare the models. The AUC values were 78.7\%,
   80.9\% and 82.4\% for RF, LMT and NBT models, respectively.
   Additionally, the NBT produced the highest accuracy and precision values
   (0.799 and 0.745, respectively). Regarding RMSE values, the NBT model
   achieved an optimized prediction than RF and LMT models (0.301; 0.428
   and 0.364, respectively). The results of the current study may inform
   further studies and appropriate landslide risk reduction and mitigation
   measures. They can also be instrumental for policy and decision making
   in regards with natural risk management.},

Title = {The Reporting of Sustainable Energy Action Plans of Municipalities:
   Methodology and Results of Case Studies from the Abruzzo Region},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Territorial energetic and environmental planning provides operational
   solidity to the concept of sustainable development, in particular in
   energy-related issues, where recent attention to and social awareness of
   climate change are driving actions and policies at local and
   international levels. The goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030 can be
   reached through the strategy of glocalization, giving more
   responsibility to local administrations like municipalities. In this
   work, a scientific methodology is developed and validated to revise
   Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP) and the monitoring phase of
   municipalities. The methodology starts from measured data in the
   territory considered and makes use of specific statistical models in
   order to estimate the needed data. The methodology considers the energy
   consumption of the main sectors: residential, transportation, tertiary,
   and commercial, with a particular focus on municipal competences (public
   lighting, urban transport, municipal fleet, etc.). Renewable energy is
   also considered due to its importance in local energy production. In
   order to go deeper into SEAPs, in this paper, the authors describe the
   quantitative analysis of the Baseline Emission Inventory, the
   quantification of the SEAP planning actions, and the definition of the
   Monitoring Emission Inventory, which is the final step of the planning
   process. This step was done for nine municipalities of the Abruzzo
   region with different characteristics (size, population, climate,
   geographical position, economy, etc.) in order to widen the results of
   the analysis and test the robustness of the methodology. Indeed, it gave
   a quantitative dimension to the primary energy consumption and CO2
   emissions for 2018, compared with the 2005 baseline values, and the
   final results are related to the reduction commitments planned for 2020.
   All the municipalities were considered to have achieved this goal,
   surpassing the 20\% emissions reduction. This validated methodology is
   also the basis for the development of the Sustainable Energy and Climate
   Action Plans (SECAPs), which integrate adaptation actions and mitigation
   ones.},

Title = {The role of economic, policy, and ecological factors in estimating the
   value of carbon stocks in Everglades mangrove forests, South Florida,
   USA},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {160-169},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Old growth mangroves in existing protected areas store more carbon than
   restored forests or plantations. Carbon storage in such forests has
   economic value independent of additionality, offering opportunities for
   policy makers to ensure their maintenance, and inclusion in climate
   change mitigation strategies. Mangrove forests of the Everglades
   National Park (ENP), South Florida, though protected, face external
   stressors such as hydrological alterations because of flooding control
   structures and agriculture impacts and saltwater intrusion as a result
   of increasing sea level rise. Moreover, decreased funding of Everglades'
   restoration activities following the recent economic crisis (beginning
   2008) threatens the restoration of the Greater Everglades including
   mangrove dominated coastal regions. We evaluate several economic and
   ecological challenges confronting the economic valuation of total
   (vegetation plus soil) organic carbon (TOC) storage in the ENP
   mangroves. Estimated TOC storage for this forested wetland ranges from
   70 to 537 Mg C/ha and is higher than values reported for tropical,
   boreal, and temperate forests. We calculate the average abatement cost
   of C specific for ENP mangroves to value the TOC from \$2-\$3.4 billion;
   estimated unit area values are \$13,859/ha-\$23,728/ha. The valuation of
   the stored/legacy carbon is based on the: 1) ecogeomorphic attributes,
   2) regional socio-economic milieu, and 3) status of the ENP mangroves as
   a protected area. The assessment of C storage estimates and its economic
   value can change public perception about how this regulating ecosystem
   service of ENP mangrove wetlands (144,447 ha) supports human well-being
   and numerous economic activities. This perception, in turn, can
   contribute to future policy changes such that the ENP mangroves, the
   largest mangrove area in the continental USA, can be included as a
   potential alternative in climate change mitigation strategies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The concept of resilience has taken root in the discourse of
   environmental management, especially regarding Building with Nature
   strategies for embedding natural physical and ecological dynamics into
   engineered interventions in developed coastal zones. Resilience is seen
   as a desirable quality, and coastal management policy and practice are
   increasingly aimed at maximising it. Despite its ubiquity, resilience
   remains ambiguous and poorly defined in management contexts. What is
   coastal resilience? And what does it mean in settings where natural
   environmental dynamics have been supplanted by human-dominated systems?
   Here, we revisit the complexities of coastal resilience as a concept, a
   term, and a prospective goal for environmental management. We consider
   examples of resilience in natural and built coastal environments, and
   offer a revised, formal definition of coastal resilience with a holistic
   scope and emphasis on systemic functionality: ``Coastal resilience is
   the capacity of the socioeconomic and natural systems in the coastal
   environment to cope with disturbances, induced by factors such as sea
   level rise, extreme events and human impacts, by adapting whilst
   maintaining their essential functions.{''} Against a backdrop of climate
   change impacts, achieving both socioeconomic and natural resilience in
   coastal environments in the long-term (>50 years) is very costly. Cost
   trade-offs among management aims and objectives mean that enhancement of
   socioeconomic resilience typically comes at the expense of natural
   resilience, and vice versa. We suggest that for practical purposes,
   optimising resilience might be a more realistic goal of coastal zone
   management.},

Title = {Exposure to external shocks and economic resilience of countries:
   evidence from global indicators},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1057-1078},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to revise, update and extend the
   economic vulnerability and economic resilience indices, where economic
   vulnerability is associated with inherent exposure to external shocks
   and economic resilience with policies that enable a country to minimize
   or withstand the negative effects of such shocks. This study also
   proposes a revised vulnerability/resilience framework to assess the risk
   of a country being harmed by external economic shocks.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology used in the study involves
   defining economic vulnerability in terms of inherent features of an
   economy and defining economic resilience in terms of policy-induced
   changes, and then devising measureable indices to measure such
   vulnerability and resilience across countries. The exercise required the
   examination of various global indices to assess their suitability, in
   terms of relevance and country coverage, for measuring the vulnerability
   index and the resilience index and the components of the two indices.
   Findings - The main finding of the study is that a number highly
   vulnerable states, including economically successful small island
   economies, emerged with high resilience scores, suggesting that they
   adopt policies that enable them to withstand the harmful effects of
   external shocks. This possibly explains why these states register
   relatively high GDP per capita, in spite of their high exposure to
   shocks. On the other hand, a number of countries, mostly large and poor
   developing countries, that are not highly exposed to external shocks due
   to their limited dependence on external trade, emerged with a low degree
   of policy-induced economic resilience.
   Research limitations/implications - The study utilized global indicators
   which sometimes had missing data and these had to be filled in using
   approximations based on assumptions, and alternative assumption could
   have produced a different approximations. In addition the classification
   of countries in terms of the vulnerability and resilience nexus depended
   highly on many underpinning assumptions, including the definitions and
   the measurement of the components, the weighting schemes and the
   thresholds used. It is likely that alternative assumptions would yield
   alternative classifications.
   Practical implications - An important practical implication of this
   study is that highly economically vulnerable states can reduce the
   harmful effects of external economic shocks if they adopt policies that
   lead to resilience building. On the other hand, countries that are not
   highly exposed to external shocks, can render themselves economically
   unstable due to their weak economic, social and environmental
   governance.
   Social implications - This study considers social development and
   cohesion as one of the pillars of resilience building. The implication
   of this approach is that social governance, leading to improvements in
   the education and health of the population could reduce the harm arising
   from a country's exposure to external shocks. This is because social
   governance affects the extent to which relations within a society are
   properly developed, enabling an effective functioning of the economic
   apparatus without the hindrance of civil unrest.
   Originality/value - This study has extended previous work on the
   vulnerability and resilience framework, to include almost all countries
   of the world, using updated data, and has revised the resilience index
   to include environmental governance. It has also redefined market
   flexibility to allow for the downsides of excessive financial riskiness.
   The revision of vulnerability and resilience indices in the light of new
   data and their interaction showed more convincingly that economies that
   are highly economically vulnerable could still register economic success
   as a result of resilience-conducive policies associated with good
   economic, political, social and environmental governance.},

Title = {The Spectrum of Proactive, Resilient Multi-Microgrid Scheduling: A
   Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Multi-microgrids address the need for a resilient, sustainable, and
   cost-effective electricity supply by providing a coordinated operation
   of individual networks. Due to local generation, dynamic network
   topologies, and islanding capabilities of hosted microgrids or groups
   thereof, various new fault mitigation and optimization options emerge.
   However, with the great flexibility, new challenges such as complex
   failure modes that need to be considered for a resilient operation,
   appear. This work systematically reviews scheduling approaches which
   significantly influence the feasibility of mitigation options before a
   failure is encountered. An in-depth analysis of identified key
   contributions covers aspects such as the mathematical apparatus, failure
   models and validation to highlight the current methodical spectrum and
   to identify future perspectives. Despite the common optimization-based
   framework, a broad variety of scheduling approaches is revealed.
   However, none of the key contributions provides practical insights
   beyond lab validation and considerable effort is required until the
   approaches can show their full potential in practical implementations.
   It is expected that the great level of detail guides further research in
   improving and validating existing scheduling concepts as well as it, in
   the long run, aids engineers to choose the most suitable options
   regarding increasingly resilient power systems.},

Abstract = {The ocean is facing multiple pressures from human activities, including
   the effects of climate change. Science has a prominent role in
   identifying problems and communicating these to society. However,
   scientists are also increasingly taking an active role in developing
   solutions, including strategies for adapting to and mitigating climate
   change, increasing food security, and reducing pollution. Transmitting
   these solutions to society changes our narrative about the ocean and
   motivates actions. The United Nations triple initiatives for this
   decade-the Sustainable Development Goals, the Decade on Ocean Science
   for Sustainable Development, and the Decade of Ecosystem
   Restoration-provide the momentum for this change in narrative and focus.
   Here, we reflect on the search for solutions and the need for better
   ways of communicating science in a positive way. We synthesize insights
   from a summer school held during the COVID-19 pandemic and present some
   examples of successes and failures and the lessons learned from these.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {403},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Urban environments face two challenging problems that are parallel in
   nature but yet with compelling potential synergistic interactions; urban
   heat island (UHI) and air pollution. We explore these interactions using
   in-situ temperature and air pollution data collected from 13 monitoring
   stations for nine years. Through regression analysis and analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) tests, we found that carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM) show
   positive correlations with UHI intensity (UHII). At the same time, Ozone
   (O-3) was negatively correlated with UHII. Moreover, there was a
   substantial seasonal effect on the strength of the correlations between
   UHI and air pollution, with some air pollutants showing strong
   associations with UHI during certain seasons (i.e., winter and autumn).
   The strongest interactions were observed for NO2 (R-2 = 0.176) and PM10
   (R-2 = 0.596) during the wintertime and for SO2 (R-2 = 0.849), CO (R-2 =
   0.346), PM2.5 (R-2 = 0.695) and O-3 (R-2 = 0.512) during autumn.
   Understanding such interactions is essential for urban climate studies
   and our study provides a basis for scientific discussions on integrative
   mitigation strategies for both UHI and air pollution in Seoul city.},

Title = {An integrated approach to assess the vulnerability to erosion in
   mangroves using GIS models in a tropical coastal protected area},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {289-307},
Abstract = {Purpose The development of models that allows the evaluation and
   prediction of erosion processes is an important tool for the management
   and planning of coastal systems. Mangrove forests systems are under
   threat by the impacts of erosion, which is also intensified by human
   activity (and aggravated in the scenarios of global warming and climate
   change). The purpose of this paper is to develop a model of geographic
   information systems (GIS) that can be used for any estuary area, but it
   can also be used for mangroves.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses georeferentiation which is
   defined as a set of parameters that best characterize the mangrove
   areas: elevation (m); geomorphology; geology; land cover; anthropogenic
   activities; distance to the coastline (m) and maximum tidal range (m).
   Three different methods are used to combine the various vulnerability
   parameters, namely, DRASTIC index, analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
   and square root of the geometric mean.
   Findings The three approaches presented in this work show different
   types evaluating vulnerability to erosion, highlighting a stronger
   overvaluation of the areas presented with a high vulnerability, through
   the use of DRASTIC index when compared with two other approaches. The
   use of the AHP shows similarity to the square root of the geometric mean
   model, but the AHP also presents a higher percentage of vulnerable areas
   classified as having medium to very high vulnerability. On the other
   hand, the use of square root of the geometric mean led to a higher
   percentage of areas classified as having low and very low vulnerability.
   Research limitations/implications These three qualitative models, based
   on a cognitive approach, using the set of parameters defined in this
   research, are a good tool for the spatial distribution of erosion in
   different mangroves in the world.
   Originality/value Global warming and climate change scenarios require
   adaptation and mitigation options supported by science-based strategies
   and solutions.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {152},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {291-305},

Abstract = {Adaptations to extreme climatic events like tropical storms are being
   built into disaster management by empowering vulnerable communities
   through activities like disaster awareness, trainings on rescue
   measures, provisions of better infrastructure, and strengthening of
   societal institutions under the Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster
   Risk Management programs. With increasing threats from climate change,
   it is essential that the effectiveness of such measures is evaluated and
   limitations are addressed. The State of Odisha in Eastern India had
   witnessed nearly 10years of such capacity building for cyclone
   management when it was hit by the severe cyclone Phailin in 2013. The
   public response to the evacuation order was overwhelming. In some areas,
   as many as 95\% of the residents evacuated, and they were aware of the
   precautions to be taken before a storm strikes whereas some other areas
   showed as low as 33\% evacuation and least interest in training and
   capacity building programs and maintenance of critical infrastructure
   like cyclone shelters. Analyzing evacuation responses with logistic
   regression, social economic issues like unemployment, prevalence of
   theft, and no provision for the evacuation of livestock to safety
   explained the evacuation failure significantly. In the future, such
   extreme events are predicted to hit coastal areas with more intensity
   due to climate change, and this necessitates that governments address
   such socio-economic problems along with cyclone adaptation programs to

Title = {Biological evaluation of an existing spatial management network for an
   exploited penaeid species},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Spatial management may be employed to achieve objectives aimed at
   maintaining or enhancing productivity and sustainability of exploited
   populations. Spatial management is used in penaeid fisheries to alter
   the spatiotemporal distribution of fishing effort to achieve outcomes
   such as avoidance of undesirable size-classes. Eastern King Prawn
   (Penaeus {[}melicertus] plebejus; EKP) is a valuable penaeid species for
   which harvest is supported by an extensive spatial management network,
   however these closures have never been evaluated. We examine temporal
   variation in biomass and size structures within three trawl closure
   areas spanning four degrees of latitude. There was substantial spatial
   variation in EKP biomass among locations, fished and non-fished zones
   and sampling periods, which appeared to be influenced by depth,
   temperature and distance to the adjacent estuarine nursery. Size
   structure varied among locations and sampling periods, and differed
   inside and outside of closure areas, however in many cases the majority
   of prawns that were protected within closure areas were consistently
   smaller than the estimated size at first capture for optimal yield per
   recruit. The data suggest that the closures are likely to be effective
   at achieving their objective, but there may be some scope for adaptive
   management. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Barriers to reducing climate enhanced disaster risks in Least Developed
   Country-Small Islands through anticipatory adaptation},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {72-83},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) classified as Least Developed
   Countries (LDCs) are particularly vulnerable to the projected impacts of
   climate change. Given their particular vulnerabilities, climate
   adaptation investments are being made through both national and
   international efforts to build the capacity of various sectors and
   communities to reduce climate risks and associated disasters. Despite
   these efforts, reducing climate risks is not free of various challenges
   and barriers. This paper aims to synthesise a set of critical
   socio-economic barriers present at various spatial scales that are
   specific to Least Developed Country SIDS. It also aims to identify the
   processes that give rise to these barriers. Drawing on theories from
   natural hazards, a systematic literature review method was adopted to
   identify and organise the set of barriers by focussing on both academic
   papers and grey literature. The data revealed a notable lack of studies
   on adaptation within African and Caribbean LDC-SIDS. In general, there
   was a paucity of academic as well as grey literature being produced by
   authors from LDC-SIDS to challenge existing discourses related to
   adaptation barriers. The most common barriers identified included those
   related to governance, technical, cognitive and cultural. Three key
   findings can be drawn from this study in relation to formal adaptation
   initiatives. Firstly, the lack of focus on the adaptive capacity needs
   of Local Government or Island Councils and communities was a key barrier
   to ensure success of adaptation interventions. Secondly, international
   adaptation funding modalities did little to address root causes of
   vulnerability or support system transformations. These funds were geared
   at supporting sectoral level adaptation initiatives for vulnerable
   natural resource sectors such as water, biodiversity and coastal zones.
   Thirdly, there is a need to recognise the significance of cultural
   knowledge and practices in shaping adaptive choices of communities in
   SIDS. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The dramatic drop in water levels in the Kinneret Lake (Sea of Galilee)
   during the past years is evaluated. Recently published measurements of
   temperature, precipitation and other hydrological data support the
   position that climate change is driving the contraction of this iconic
   water resource. The article presents a range of evidence confirming
   long-term shifts in the hydrological dynamics of the watershed and
   details the associated ecological implications. In response to these
   trends, Israel's government has decided to build a desalination plant
   along the Northern Mediterranean shoreline that will provide water to
   replenish the depleted water levels in lake. Given the likelihood of
   continued global warming expediting increased evaporation and reduced
   precipitation, such climate adaptation policies constitute prudent

Journal = {GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT},

Number = {7},
Pages = {4443-4464},

Abstract = {Sensitivity of the PALM model 6.0 with respect to land-surface and
   building properties is tested in a real urban environment in the
   vicinity of a typical crossroads in a densely built-up residential area
   in Prague, Czech Republic. The turbulence-resolving PALM is able to
   simulate the urban boundary layer flow for realistic setups. Besides an
   accurate representation of the relevant physical processes, the model
   performance also depends on the input data describing the urban setup,
   namely the building and land-surface properties. Two types of scenario
   are employed. The first one is the synthetic scenarios altering mainly
   surface and material parameters such as albedo, emissivity or wall
   conductivity, testing sensitivity of the model simulations to
   potentially erroneous input data. Second, urbanistic-type scenarios are
   analysed, in which commonly considered urban heat island mitigation
   measures such as greening of the streets or changing surface materials
   are applied in order to assess the limits of the effects of a particular
   type of scenario. For the synthetic scenarios, surface parameters used
   in radiation balance equations are found to be the most sensitive
   overall followed by the volumetric heat capacity and thermal
   conductivity of walls. Other parameters show a limited average effect;
   however, some can still be significant during some parts of the day,
   such as surface roughness in the morning hours. The second type, the
   urbanistic scenarios, shows urban vegetation to be the most effective
   measure, especially when considering both physical and biophysical
   temperature indica-tors. The influence of both types of scenario was
   also tested for air quality, specifically PM2.5 dispersion, which
   generally shows opposite behaviour to that of thermal indicators; i.e.
   improved thermal comfort brings deterioration of PM2.5 concentrations.},

Abstract = {The Sittaung Estuary in Myanmar is the northern boundary of the Gulf of
   Mottama, where the outflow of the Sittaung river interacts with the
   tides in the Gulf of Mottama. The banks of this estuary experience
   cycles of extreme erosion rates, of up to 1.6 km/y, which forces local
   communities to abandon their villages and farms, while elsewhere in the
   estuary accretion and growth of tidal flats allows for the development
   of new agricultural land. As part of the Gulf of Mottama Project, we
   analyzed the rates of coastal erosion, studied the causes for the
   extreme dynamics and proposed adaptation strategies. Shoreline locations
   have been mapped from satellite images. Two field campaigns provided
   data on tidal channel depths and flow velocities. A numerical model of
   the estuary provided insight in the flow dynamics during the dry and wet
   season and allowed testing of potential measures. We found that the
   erosion predominantly results from the natural buildup and migration of
   bars and associated tidal channel migration (bar push); at other
   locations bank pull dominates the erosion processes. Moreover, channels
   are typically too small for the tidal prism, which results in extreme
   flow velocities. There are no human factors involved in the observed
   dynamics. A full stop or reduction of shoreline retreat may be achieved
   with traditional engineering measures with rock or concrete on the
   channel slopes and banks. Alternatively, Building with Nature type of
   interventions can be considered for example using vegetation on tidal
   flats or strategic sediment dredging and dumping, because they reduce
   tidal prism. However, none of the considered measures are considered
   cost-benefit effective, because the required investments exceed by far
   the economic value of the protected assets. The extreme and globally
   unique morphodynamic behavior of the Sittaung estuary is predictable on
   the short-term (< 5y), which means that adaptive use of the land, i.e.
   managed coastal retreat and managed coastal expansion, seems a most
   viable alternative. To support local communities, this may be
   facilitated by mobile infrastructure and accommodations, adequate
   monitoring of the actual shoreline development and communication with
   the local communities as part of an (adaptive) strategy for Bago Region
   and Mon State.},

Abstract = {The effects of environmental conditions on cholinesterase activity and
   kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis in the hemolymph of the
   mussel Crenomytilus grayanus were studied. Under seasonal upwellings,
   the cholinergic system efficiency is provided for by a wide range of
   efficient concentrations of the substrate, i.e., under such conditions
   the mussels at the molecular level have a quantitative adaptation
   strategy of the enzyme. In mussels from the stationary upwelling zone
   (at a steady low temperature of water) for efficiency of the cholinergic
   system, the quantitative strategy of enzyme adaptation is realized. In
   mussels from a highly contaminated site, irreversible damages to the
   cholinergic process were observed. The affinity of the substrate to the
   enzyme is highly informative and an appropriate biomarker for the load
   level and the adaptation capacity of the organism. The affinity of the
   substrate to the enzyme is recommended as a new biomarker.},

Abstract = {Damage from weather-related events is expected to increase in the future
   due to socio-economic growth that increases exposure to natural
   disasters and anticipated climate change. This paper studies the
   long-term impacts of climate change and land-use planning on flood risk,
   with a particular focus on flood risk insurance in the Netherlands. This
   study estimates the full probability distributions of flood damage under
   four different scenarios of climate change and socio-economic
   development for the year 2040. Subsequently, the risk-based
   (re)insurance premiums for flood coverage are estimated for each of the
   53 dyke-ring areas in the Netherlands, using a method that takes into
   account the insurer's risk aversion to covering uncertain catastrophe
   risk. On the basis of the results, we can draw four main lessons. First,
   extreme climate change with a high sea level rise has a higher impact on
   flood (re)insurance premiums compared with future socio-economic
   development. Second, (re)insuring large flood losses may become very
   expensive in the future. Third, a public-private insurance system in
   which the government acts as a risk-neutral reinsurer of last resort,
   accompanied by comprehensive adaptation and risk reduction measures,
   could be a good solution for making flood risk insurance available at an
   affordable price. Fourth, given the projected increase in flood risk, it
   is especially important that flood insurance contributes to climate
   change adaptation.},

Title = {The potential impact of fishing in peruvian marine protected areas
   (MPAs) on artisanal fishery poverty during El Nino events},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {202},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In Peru, the fishing sector, particularly artisanal fishing, is one of
   the most impacted by El Nin similar to o phenomenon. One possible
   adaptation strategy to mitigate the negative economic effects of El Nin
   similar to o is the development of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This
   study measures the effect on poverty of artisanal fishers of being able
   to fish in Peruvian MPAs in the face of the El Nin similar to o.
   Therefore, using propensity score matching, we estimated the effect of
   the El Nin similar to o 2015 event on the income of fishers by comparing
   the poverty levels of fishers with and without access to the MPAs. The
   study estimated no significant effect of the MPAs on probability of
   poverty reduction in two out of three MPAs but a 29\% (17\%;42\%) was
   detected at one MPA. The results indicate that fishing in Peruvian MPAs
   could reduce the vulnerability of artisanal fishers to El Nin similar to
   o. Additionally, this study concludes that the estimated impact in
   reducing the effects of El Nin similar to o on the poverty depends
   largely on the participation of fishers in its management and highlights
   the importance of taking a transdisciplinary and cross sector approach
   to MPA design and management to ensure the potential benefits of MPAs
   can be realised.},

Title = {An assessment of measured and computed depth of closure around Japan},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {The development of effective coastal adaptation strategies and
   protection schemes is a major challenge for coastal zone managers and
   engineers, not only because the coastal zone is the most populated and
   developed land zone in the world, but also due to projected climate
   change impacts. A priori knowledge of the so called depth of closure
   (DoC) is, more often than not, a pre-requisite to understand and model
   coastal morphological response to wave forcing, which in turn enables
   the design of appropriate coastal adaption/protection measures. In the
   absence of long term measurements of coastal profile data, the DoC is
   often computed using Hallermeier's formulations or derivatives thereof,
   for applications around the world. However, there are two major
   unresolved issues associated with computing the DoC in this way: the
   accuracy of the wave data required for reliable DoC computations, and
   the generic applicability of the coefficients used in DoC equations.
   This study exploits the availability of DoCs derived from multiple
   measurements of coastal profiles and wave data along the Japanese coast
   together with wave reanalysis products to evaluate the validity of DoC
   calculation approaches. Results show that the accuracy of computed DoC
   values determined using wave reanalysis data is limited, particularly
   when the spatial resolution of the wave reanalysis data is lower.
   Furthermore, coefficients of DoC equations proposed in previous and
   present studies appear to be location specific and points toward the
   need for a concerted worldwide meta-analysis that compares observed and
   derived DoC in order to derive a globally applicable formulation for DoC
   computations.},

Abstract = {The world is facing the observable and direct impacts of climate change
   in the shape of extreme weather events, irregular precipitation, glacial
   melt, sea-level rise, an asymmetric average temperature trends, higher
   oceanic temperatures, damage to natural ecosystems, and biodiversity. In
   2015, collective wisdom stirred the global community to agree upon two
   unprecedented milestones in recent human history-the Paris agreement and
   sustainable development goals (SDGs). The twin global agreements set a
   platform for collective efforts to secure socio-economic and climatic
   sustainability. Pakistan also joined the board to put forth policy
   interventions for the mitigation and adaption of climate change risks to
   maintain symmetry between the environmental quality and economic
   development. The government of Pakistan (GOP) formulated the National
   Climate Change Policy (NCCP (2012)) and passed the Pakistan Climate
   Change Act (PCCA (2017)) to provide an impetus for the implementation of
   the NCCP. Yet, an appropriate assessment and prioritization of the
   objectives of the NCCP are indispensable for productive and effective
   policies to achieve the targets. This study serves this purpose by
   prioritizing the climate change policy objectives (CCPOs) based on
   symmetric principles, i.e., energy, transport, urban and town planning,
   industry, and agriculture as criteria, with 17 sub-criteria in total.
   The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) results show that the
   energy sector is the most pivotal while implementing the NCCP. Energy
   production is the most critical area that needs mitigation policy
   intervention for shifting the energy mix of the economy from high-carbon
   to low-carbon energy. The fuzzy AHP analysis further revealed the
   railway, population and urbanization, air pollution, crop growing
   practices and techniques as the most important related to transport,
   urban planning, industry, and agriculture sub-criteria, respectively.
   The fuzzy VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR)
   analysis showed the ranking of the CCPOs from high to low through the
   integration of policies, institutional capacity building, water
   security, natural resource management, natural disaster management,
   environmental financial structure development, and social sector
   development. The findings of the present research would be helpful for
   experts and policymakers to re-examine the NCCP and put forth action
   plans to achieve sustainable climate and SDGs.},

Title = {Cooling the cities - A review of reflective and green roof mitigation
   technologies to fight heat island and improve comfort in urban
   environments},
Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {682-703},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The temperature of cities continues to increase because of the heat
   island phenomenon and the undeniable climatic change. The observed high
   ambient temperatures intensify the energy problem of cities,
   deteriorates comfort conditions, put in danger the vulnerable population
   and amplify the pollution problems. To counterbalance the phenomenon,
   important mitigation technologies have been developed and proposed.
   Among them, technologies aiming to increase the albedo of cities and the
   use of vegetative green roofs appear to be very promising, presenting a
   relatively high heat island mitigation potential. This paper aims to
   present the state of the art on both the above technologies, when
   applied in the city scale. Tenths of published studies have been
   analysed. Most of the available data are based on simulation studies
   using mesoscale modeling techniques while important data are available
   from the existing experimental studies. When a global increase of the
   city's albedo is considered, the expected mean decrease of the average
   ambient temperature is close to 0.3 K per 0.1 rise of the albedo, while
   the corresponding average decrease of the peak ambient temperature is
   close to 0.9 K. When only cool roofs are considered, the analysis of the
   existing data shows that the expected depression rate of the average
   urban ambient temperature varies between 0.1 and 0.33 K per 0.1 increase
   of the roofs albedo with a mean value close to 0.2 K. As it concerns
   green roofs, existing simulation studies show that when applied on a
   city scale, they may reduce the average ambient temperature between 0.3
   and 3 K. Detailed analysis of many studies reporting a comparison of the
   mitigation potential of both technologies has permitted the definition
   of the limits, the boundaries and the conditions under which the
   considered technologies reach their better performance, in a synthetic
   way. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {By hindering migration and inducing direct turbine mortality during
   downstream migration, hydropower is regarded as one of the most serious
   threats to anadromous salmonids. Yet, little attention has been paid to
   long-term turbine-induced selection mechanisms effecting fish
   populations. This work evaluates turbine and post-turbine survival of
   PIT-tagged wild brown trout smolts. By estimating individual river and
   sea survival rates, we were able to compare survival rates of smolts
   that had migrated through the turbine with smolts that had bypassed the
   turbine, as well as investigate both natural and anthropogenic
   size-selective mechanisms operative on the population. Total
   river-descent survival probability was 0.20 for turbine migrants and
   0.44 for bypass migrants. The surviving turbine migrants were
   significantly smaller than their bypass counterparts and more exposed to
   predation from Northern pike. The estimated mean-adjusted selection
   gradient was - 0.76 for turbine migrants and + 1.85 for the bypass
   migrants. The resulting disruptive selection may ultimately lead to
   increased phenotypic smolt size variation provided sufficient additive
   genetic variance associated with smolt size. Mitigation measures at
   hydropower plants are thus essential for preserving sustainable
   populations of anadromous fish and maintaining population genetic
   variation.},

   consumption of rice the world's number one food crop. A global rice
   trade model is utilized to do this. The results indicate that the
   combination of yield and sea level effects causes a significant
   reduction in production and an increase in rice prices which may have
   important policy implications for food security. Global rice production
   is reduced by 1.60\% to 2.73\% while global rice price increases by
   7.14\% to 12.77\%. Sea level rise is particularly a risk factor in
   Bangladesh, Japan, Taiwan, Egypt, Myanmar and Vietnam. In the face of
   such developments, adaptation may well be desirable and thus an
   investigation is done over adaptation options of increased technical
   progress or trade liberalization with the results showing that both can
   mitigate such damages.},

Abstract = {A commonly used technique for mitigating thermoacoustic instability in
   an enclosed combustion environment is removing more acoustic energy from
   the combustor, at the frequency corresponding to the acoustic mode(s) of
   the combustor which are sympathetic to such instability. This approach
   is based on adding tuned acoustic damping to the combustion environment.
   By incorporating in-situ adjustability into acoustic damping devices,
   they can change their mechanical attributes, e.g., mass and/or
   stiffness, and adapt themselves in a semi-active manner to the varying
   instability frequency. Adaptive-passive thermoacoustic mitigation
   solutions have less weight penalty than the alternative active solutions
   mainly because the adaptation is done in a semi-active way, at slow
   pace, with a small and less power-hungry actuation mechanisms. Moreover,
   the flexibility they offer make them highly desirable for land and
   marine instability mitigation applications.
   In this work, semi-active adjustment of a novel tuned acoustic damper,
   namely an acoustic radiator, is explored. The paper describes the inner
   working of a semi-active (adaptive-passive) acoustic radiator and the
   relevant control schemes to adapt them to the instability frequency on
   hand. The damping effectiveness of the proposed damper, is demonstrated
   experimentally. It should be mentioned that the semi-active control
   strategies developed for acoustic radiators can also be used, with minor
   modifications, for semi-active control of other acoustic damping
   mechanisms such as Helmholtz resonators and quarter-wave tubes.},

Abstract = {In 2009 the World Bank launched the Economics of Adaptation to Climate
   Change (EACC) study to provide up-to-date and consistent estimates of
   adaptation costs for developing countries. The EACC study addresses many
   of the shortcomings found in the adaptation cost literature. First, it
   defines `adaptation costs' as those additional costs of development due
   to climate change, thereby avoiding confounding the costs of closing the
   development deficit and the implicit adaptation deficit. Second, the
   study covers eight major sectors: infrastructure, coastal zones, water
   supply, agriculture, fisheries, forests and ecosystems, human health,
   and extreme weather events. Third, it employs common population and GDP
   growth trajectories across sectors and uses two climate scenarios to
   capture the full spread of model predictions. Finally, the EACC study
   uses an innovative methodology for aggregating costs at the sector level
   within a country, and across countries. Under these assumptions, the
   global price tag for the developing world of adapting to an
   approximately 2 degrees C warmer world by 2050 is US\$70-100 billion per
   year for 2010-2050.},

Pages = {120-128},
Abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in
   the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and
   industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat
   generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar
   radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes
   of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area
   as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island
   Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises
   with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated
   three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly
   exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the
   near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort
   has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the
   subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest
   research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools
   and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and
   summarize this research area through an investigation of the most
   important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by
   the urban structures plays the most important role which should be
   investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It
   was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design
   and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island
   and ultimately living in a better environment.},

Abstract = {Managing flood risk, i.e. both the hazard and the potential
   consequences, is an important aspect of adapting to global change and
   has gained much traction in recent decades. As a result, a priori flood
   risk assessments have become an important part of flood management
   practices. Many methodologies have been set up, ranging from global risk
   assessments for the world as a whole, to local assessments for a
   particular stretch of a river/coast or small town. Most assessment
   frameworks generally follow a similar approach, but there are also
   notable differences between assessments at different spatial scales.
   This review article examines these differences, for instance those
   related to the methodology, use of assessments and uncertainties. From
   this review, future research needs are identified in order to improve
   flood risk assessments at different scales. At global/continental scale,
   there is a clear need for harmonised information on flood defences to
   improve assessments. Furthermore, inclusions of indirect economic
   effects at the macro-/meso-scale would give a better indication of the
   total effects of catastrophic flooding. At the meso-/micro-scale, there
   is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the effects of
   flooding on critical infrastructures, given their importance to society,
   the economy, emergency management and reconstruction. An overarching
   theme at all scales is the validation of flood risk assessments, which
   is often limited. More detailed post-disaster information would allow
   for improved calibration, validation and thus performance of flood risk
   models. Lastly, the link between spatial scales also deserves attention,
   for instance up- or downscaling methodologies.},

Abstract = {Low-lying coastal communities face almost insurmountable challenges from
   floods and climate change. Research work on adaptation and mitigation
   particularly emphasizes on cities and mega-cities as a natural
   consequence of their agglomeration of people and assets. Less focus is
   put on smaller coastal communities and their challenges, one of which is
   a lack of local expertise and knowledge. Adaptation to climate change is
   often a local governance level task, however. Co-work between municipal
   and national authorities, the utility company, research, business,
   consultants and citizens has resulted in a common framework to address
   and deal with water-related challenges in a Danish coastal community.
   From an assessment of combined impacts of climate change (i.e. sea level
   rise and storm surges, precipitation and cloudbursts and associated
   groundwater level responses) and stresses from degrading sewer systems
   and land subsidence, impact zones are mapped. The multi-player, end-user
   defined work transcends sectors and builds capacity by sharing data and
   knowledge. It mainstreams climate change issues into business,
   management, planning and early warning: the overall goal is an
   adaptation strategy unfolded from stakeholder involvement and
   responsibility, cost-effective decision making, climate-related asset
   management processes and a holistic livable cities approach to this
   highly vulnerable coastal community. The collaboration and common
   framework enable the actors to articulate need of information and
   establish feedback mechanisms between local level work and e.g. sea
   level research and climate services.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of climate change and urbanization, many cities will
   have to deal with more flooding and extreme heat stress. This paper
   presents a framework to maximize the effectiveness of Nature-Based
   Solutions (NBS) for flood risk reduction and thermal comfort
   enhancement. The framework involves an assessment of hazards with the
   use of models and field measurements. It also detects suitable
   implementation sites for NBS and quantifies their effectiveness for
   thermal comfort enhancement and flood risk reduction. The framework was
   applied in a densely urbanized study area, for which different
   small-scale urban NBS and their potential locations for implementation
   were assessed. The overall results show that the most effective
   performance in terms of flood mitigation and thermal comfort enhancement
   is likely achieved by applying a range of different measures at
   different locations. Therefore, the work presented here shows the
   potential of the framework to achieve an effective combination of
   measures and their locations, which was demonstrated on the case of the
   Sukhumvit area in Bangkok (Thailand). This can be particularly suitable
   for assessing and planning flood mitigation measures in combination with
   heat stress reduction.},

Title = {Institutional and Conceptual Barriers to Climate Change Adaptation for
   Coastal Cultural Heritage},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasing the speed at which tangible coastal
   cultural heritage is changing in character or being lost through
   weathering, erosion, and inundation. Damages to coastal archeological
   sites, loss of access to historical sites, and the alteration of
   cultural landscapes will force changes in the way researchers can study
   sites, tourists can enjoy places, and descendant communities who have
   lived in particular areas for time immemorial, and local community
   members can utilize and relate to landscapes. In the USA, the National
   Park Service is a primary coastal cultural resource management
   organization. The National Park Service has been working on climate
   change adaptation for cultural resources for over a decade; however,
   there are few examples of parks in which long range climate change
   adaptation plans for cultural resources have been implemented. Building
   from 20 semi-structured interviews with cultural resource managers in
   three parks, we found that institutional structures within the National
   Park Service, as well as historical conceptual framings specific to the
   research, recreational, and interpretive values of cultural resources
   act as barriers to managers' ability to design and implement climate
   change adaptation plans. Institutional barriers managers discussed
   include the dependence of climate change adaptation decisions
   partnership projects and the leveraging of budgetary and staff resources
   within NPS that may affect climate change adaptation capacity. We found
   that park managers often saw impacts in parks that may be associated
   with climate change, but found it difficult to separate normal
   maintenance from climate change affected deterioration, which may lead
   to status quo management actions rather than revised planning for a
   changing future regime. Conceptual barriers managers discussed revealed
   a conflict between preservation needs of research versus interpretive
   uses and while NPS guidance recommends prioritization of cultural
   resources for preservation at the park level, regional managers were
   more focused on this topic than park managers. As NPS moves forward with
   climate change adaptation planning, opportunities to develop and improve
   cultural resource preservation with new technologies, improved
   prioritization schemes, and include public input in resource
   preservation may help coastal managers overcome these barriers.},

Title = {Lower Urban Humidity Moderates Outdoor Heat Stress},
Journal = {AGU ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Surface temperature is often used to examine heat exposure in multi-city
   studies and for informing urban heat mitigation efforts due to scarcity
   of urban air temperature measurements. Cities also have lower relative
   humidity, traditionally not accounted for in large-scale observational
   urban heat risk assessments. Here, using crowdsourced measurements from
   over 40,000 weather stations in approximate to 600 urban clusters in
   Europe, we show the moderating effect of this urbanization-induced
   humidity reduction on outdoor heat stress during the 2019 heatwave. We
   demonstrate that daytime differences in heat index between urban
   clusters and their surroundings are weak, and associations of this
   urban-rural difference with background climate, generally examined from
   the surface temperature perspective, are diminished due to moisture
   feedbacks. We also examine the spatial variability of surface
   temperature, air temperature, and heat index within these
   clusters-relevant for detecting hotspots and potential disparities in
   heat exposure-and find that surface temperature is a poor proxy for the
   intra-urban distribution of heat index during daytime. Finally, urban
   vegetation shows much weaker (similar to 1/6th as strong) associations
   with heat index than with surface temperature, which has broad
   implications for optimizing urban heat stress mitigation strategies.
   These findings are valid for operational metrics of heat stress for
   shaded conditions (apparent temperature and humidex), thermodynamic
   proxies (wet-bulb temperature), and empirical heat indices. Based on
   this large-scale empirical evidence, surface temperature, used due to
   the lack of better alternatives, may not be suitable for accurately
   informing heat mitigation strategies within and across cities,
   necessitating more urban-scale observations and better urban-resolving
   models.},

Title = {Combating Urban Heat Island Effect-A Review of Reflective Pavements and
   Tree Shading Strategies},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pavements occupy about 40\% of urban land cover, with 75-80\% black top
   roads, playing a critical role in urban connectivity and mobility. Solar
   energy is absorbed and stored in pavements leading to an increase in
   surface temperatures. Decreasing green cover is further contributing to
   rise in regional temperatures. Due to this activity, the city
   experiences urban heat island (UHI). This study presents a critical
   review of the literature on mitigation measures to combat UHI using
   reflective pavements with an emphasis on durability properties and
   impacts of tree canopy. The strategies with a focus on application of
   chip seals, white toppings, and coatings were discussed. Role of surface
   reflectance, including those from asphalt and concrete pavements, albedo
   improvements, and technological trends, application of waste materials,
   and industrial by-products are presented. Also, urban tree shading
   systems' contribution to pavement temperature and microclimate systems
   is presented. The review shows that the development of mitigation
   measures using tree shading systems can reduce the pavement temperature
   during daytime and increase human thermal comfort. The outcomes of this
   review provide a scope for future studies to develop sustainable and
   state-of-the-art engineering solutions in the field of reflective
   coatings and urban forest systems.},

Title = {Heterogeneity of values for coastal flood risk management with
   nature-based solutions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {304},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to understand preferences for different
   coastal flood protection measures and the factors that influence such
   preferences, to inform management and policy. The Discrete Choice
   Experiment applied to Wales residents revealed that there is
   willingness-to-pay for coastal flood protection, especially through
   Nature-based Solutions (NbS) including expanding saltmarsh area and
   increasing saltmarsh with high vegetation. The preference for NbS
   provides evidence for including specific coastal area targets in
   financial schemes initially aimed at other benefits from natural
   habitats, such as habitat creation for biodiversity. This joint action
   will maximise the benefits from NbS and ensure integrated and concerted
   efforts across, often disjointed, sectors. There were also high levels
   of heterogeneity for preferences in different groups of people. For
   instance, results support that direct flood experience and damage
   severity can give rise to behavioural intentions that support mitigation
   and adaptation measures. Findings also highlight how crucial
   environmental education and direct contact with the object of study are
   for securing support and buy-in for flood protection measures. This work
   is original in that it considers the different types of management for a
   habitat as NbS and the heterogeneity of preferences within a population.
   Results are significant in providing a basis for future NbS developments
   and in supporting flood risk policy and management.},

Abstract = {The Forest ecosystem genomics Research: supporTing Transatlantic
   Cooperation project (FoResTTraC, http://www.foresttrac.eu/) sponsored a
   workshop in August 2010 to evaluate the potential for using a landscape
   genomics approach for studying plant adaptation to the environment and
   the potential of local populations for coping with changing climate.
   This paper summarizes our discussions and articulates a vision of how we
   believe forest trees offer an unparalleled opportunity to address
   fundamental biological questions, as well as how the application of
   landscape genomic methods complement to traditional forest genetic
   approaches that provide critical information needed for natural resource
   management. In this paper, we will cover four topics. First, we begin by
   defining landscape genomics and briefly reviewing the unique situation
   for tree species in the application of this approach toward
   understanding plant adaptation to the environment. Second, we review
   traditional approaches in forest genetics for studying local adaptation
   and identifying loci underlying locally adapted phenotypes. Third, we
   present existing and emerging methods available for landscape genomic
   analyses. Finally, we briefly touch on how these approaches can aid in
   understanding practical topics such as management of tree populations
   facing climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate change will bring more heat extremes to the already warm
   tropical areas in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The resulting surge in
   cooling demand will only make the thermal discomfort in tropical cities

   management of cooling load is particularly problematic in the tropics.
   It then presents the technical, institutional and cultural challenges to
   passive climate-sensitive design in the tropics and posits three ideas
   as part of the way forward: reformulation of thermal pleasure in the
   tropics, linking the `in' and the `out' at neighbourhood scale and
   provision of adaptive opportunities varied by activity patterns.
   Research approaches to advance these ideas are also discussed. (c) 2017

Abstract = {Anthropogenic interventions have altered the natural environment and
   affected many of its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.
   Changes in land use-land cover (LULC) are one of the main drivers that
   alter the hydrologic cycle and cause significant impacts on local,
   regional, and even the global climate system. It is now widely
   recognised and accepted that climate change is one of the gravest
   problems that our planet Earth is facing at present. This study analyses
   the impact of LULC dynamics on the spatial and temporal variation of
   land surface temperature (LST) in an inter-state river basin, which also
   happens to be the largest river basin in the state of Kerala, India,
   viz. the Bharathapuzha river basin, during the period 1990-2017. LST
   time-series analysis (derived from Landsat) revealed that 98\% of the
   river basin experienced LST less than 298 K in January 1990. Over time,
   along with changes in LULC, LST also increased; in 2017, about 7.82\% of
   the river basin experienced LST greater than 312 K. A notable change in
   LULC that occurred during this period was the drastic increase in areas
   with high albedo. The seasonal curves of LST derived from MODIS data are
   strong evidence of the devastating impacts of change in LULC on LST and,
   in turn, on climate change. The major spatial and temporal components of
   change in LST in the study region were identified by principal component
   analysis (PCA). The results of this spatiotemporal analysis spread over
   a period of 28 years can be used for formulating sustainable development
   policies and mitigation strategies against extreme climatic events in
   the river basin.},

Title = {Transformative learning and community resilience to cyclones and storm
   surges: The case of coastal communities in Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While it has been widely recognized that building community resilience
   to climate induced shocks requires learning processes at multiple
   societal levels, there has been limited research on the specific types
   of learning required at individual level to influence change and
   transformation at the community level. To determine how transformative
   learning and risk-mitigation actions shape community resilience to
   climate-induced disasters, we carried out a mixed-method empirical
   investigation on the southern coast of Bangladesh. We found that the
   relationship between transformative learning and resilience-building is
   complex, involving multiple social cultural-structural factors (e.g.,
   beliefs, values, power structures), practical considerations (e.g.,
   impact on livelihood, evacuation and relocation logistics), and
   cognitive factors. From our observations, we draw four general
   conclusions: i) local culture can constrain people?s framing of risk and
   capacity for critical reflection, resulting in a deliberate denial and
   amnesia of past traumatic experiences; ii) learning alone cannot enhance
   resilience unless it is translated into action; iii) dependence on
   experiential learning can lead to the assumption that the severity of
   past disasters will not be surpassed, generating a false sense of
   security; and iv) the cultivation of forward-thinking attitudes coupled
   with innovative strategies, such as social networking, can successfully
   enhance resilience to climate-related disasters. Future policymaking
   aimed at building community resilience to climate shocks should
   therefore take into account cultural and individual cognitive barriers
   to transformative learning and attempt to remove structural barriers to
   translating learning into practical action.},

Title = {Institutional adaptation to environmental risk under the transition in

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS},

Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {738-758},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper develops a theoretical perspective on institutional
   adaptation to social vulnerability to environmental risks. Institutions
   encompass both socialized ways of interacting and underlying worldviews,
   as well as structures and organizations that influence resource
   allocation The adaptation of institutions that mediate vulnerability to
   environmental change can be observed by examining actual resource
   allocations and the processes of decisionmaking and nondecisionmaking,
   as well as by examining changing perceptions of vulnerability.
   Institutional adaptation is evaluated in Nam Dinh Province in northern
   Vietnam, a country presently undergoing rapid economic and political
   transition. The case study highlights local-level institutional
   adaptation to environmental risks associated with flooding and typhoon
   impacts in the coastal environment. It is carried out through fieldwork
   involving qualitative household survey is and interviewing to elicit
   present and recent coping and adaptation strategies in the context of
   rapid changes in property rights and economic circumstances. Although
   Vietnam's transition from state central planning is often heralded as a
   macroeconomic success story, this study argues that the transition has
   had negative impacts on social Vulnerability. A decrease in collective
   action for risk management by state institutions is exacerbated by
   inertia in some aspects of the decentralized state planning system,
   while the parallel spontaneous reemergence of civil institutions forms a
   counterbalancing institutional adaptation.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {38},
Number = {24},
Pages = {6441-6450},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Two studies were conducted to gauge likely public perceptions of
   proposals to avoid releasing carbon dioxide from power plants to the
   atmosphere by injecting it into deep geological formations or the deep
   ocean. Following a modified version of the mental model interview
   method, Study 1 involved face-to-face interviews with 18 nontechnical
   respondents. Respondents shared their beliefs after receiving basic
   information about the technologies and again after getting specific
   details. Many interviewees wanted to frame the issue in the broader
   context of alternative strategies for carbon management, but public
   understanding of mitigation strategies is limited. The second study,
   administered to a sample of 126 individuals, involved a closed-form
   survey that measured the prevalence of general beliefs revealed in study
   1 and also assessed the respondent's views of these technologies. Study
   results suggest that the public may develop misgivings about deep
   injection of carbon dioxide because it can be seen as temporizing and
   perhaps creating future problems. Ocean injection was seen as more
   problematic than geological injection. An approach to public
   communication and regulation that is open and respectful of public
   concerns is likely to be a prerequisite to the successful adoption of
   this technology.},

Title = {Understanding the economic impacts of sea-level rise on tourism
   prosperity: Conceptualization and panel data evidence},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {240-253},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise is a long-term, intractable problem during which costly,
   large-scale inundation could occur in many countries; hence, tourism
   development should take this matter into account because ecology and
   biodiversity are the fundamentals underpinning tourism performance. This
   study conceptualizes an economic mechanism of the potential effects of
   sea-level rise on tourism development based on projected impacts for the
   2001-2100 period. Data for 48 developing countries across Africa, Asia,
   and South America are analyzed. The theoretical framework proposes two
   hypotheses to determine the extent of contradiction between awareness
   and destruction in relation to environmental protection for tourism
   development. From the panel data regression results, although
   destructive effects are bound to dominate the entire 21st century,
   awareness is latent and has the potential to reverse the destructive
   outcomes. With evidence from essential economic elements, this study
   gives new insights into how severe the impacts of sea-level rise on
   tourism could be if shared values and adaptation measures to mitigate
   rising sea level are not substantively promoted around the globe. The
   new findings show a 0.95 standard-deviation decrease in tourism
   performance following a 1 standard-deviation increase in the economic
   loss related sea-level rise. Hence, in the main conclusions, we
   highlight that the projected effect of inundation-related deterioration
   on a country's tourism sector appears to be approximately on par with
   the costs of inundations to its economic growth.},

Title = {A fiscal revolution inspired by the Capabilities Approach to reduce
   socio-economic impact of climate change and strengthen the resilience of
   tax systems},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This paper shows that a fuller integration of the economic theory of
   well-being into strategies adopted to reduce the impact of climate
   change could help to avoid potential conflicts between the mitigation
   measures applied and the consumption of energy derived from fossil
   fuels. The paper moves along the path traced by Wood and Roelich (2019)
   with their Tensions Triangle Theory, but aims to develop it further from
   an operational point of view, showing how contemporary ecological tax
   reforms, if inspired by the Capabilities Approach, could more
   effectively contribute to achieving an inclusive, sustainable,
   accessible and secure global energy system, that provides solutions to
   energy challenges and, at the same time, creates value for business and
   civil society as a whole, without compromising the balance between the
   three fundamental elements of the tensions triangle described by Wood
   and Roelich. In particular, this chapter aims to show how the
   enlargement of the tax area according to new criteria of distributive
   justice inspired by the Capabilities Approach could serve to increase
   the mobility of social assets and to develop strategies to adapt public
   finance systems to the changes produced not only by environmental
   emergencies, but also by other sudden and adverse phenomena, such as
   economic crises and significant revenue losses caused by the adoption of
   non-transparent or harmful tax practices. Finally, the paper considers
   the proposal to establish taxes on so-called global commons-such as the
   atmosphere, climate, healthy environment, oceans-and to redistribute
   their revenue to reduce economic inequalities and poverty.},

Title = {A decision support tool for integrated fisheries bycatch management},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {441-472},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Participatory decision tools enable stakeholders to reconcile
   conflicting natural resources management objectives. Fisheries targeting
   highly productive species can have profound impacts on co-occurring
   bycatch species with low fecundity and other life history traits that
   make them vulnerable to anthropogenic sources of mortality. This study
   developed a decision tool for integrated bycatch management for
   data-limited to data-rich fisheries, improving upon current piecemeal
   approaches. First, through a systematic literature review, participants
   compile a comprehensive database of methods to mitigate the catch and
   fishing mortality of threatened bycatch species. These mitigation
   methods are then categorized into tiers of a sequential mitigation
   hierarchy, where interventions that avoid capture are considered before
   those that minimize catchability, followed by methods that minimize
   fishing mortality, before approaches that offset residual impacts. The
   methods are also assembled within an evidence hierarchy, where findings
   from meta-analytic modelling studies are more robust and generalizable
   than from individual studies. The decision tool enables stakeholders to
   evaluate alternative bycatch management strategies' efficacy at meeting
   specific and measurable objectives for mitigating the catch and
   mortality of bycatch and for costs from multispecies conflicts, economic
   viability, practicality and safety, while accounting for the
   fishery-specific feasibility of compliance monitoring of alternative
   bycatch management measures. Ongoing adaptation of the bycatch
   management framework addresses findings from performance assessments,
   updated evidence, new mitigation methods and changes to governance
   systems. The proposed decision tool therefore enables stakeholders to
   develop bycatch management frameworks that provide precautionary
   protection for the most vulnerable populations with acceptable
   tradeoffs.},

Title = {Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Native Plant Distributions in the
   Falkland Islands},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {The Falkland Islands are predicted to experience up to 2.2 degrees C
   rise in mean annual temperature over the coming century, greater than
   four times the rate over the last century. Our study investigates likely
   vulnerabilities of a suite of range-restricted species whose
   distributions are associated with archipelago-wide climatic variation.
   We used present day climate maps calibrated using local weather data,
   2020-2080 climate predictions from regional climate models, non-climate
   variables derived from a digital terrain model and a comprehensive
   database on local plant distributions. Weighted mean ensemble models
   were produced to assess changes in range sizes and overlaps between the
   current range and protected areas network. Target species included three
   globally threatened Falkland endemics, Nassauvia falklandica, Nastanthus
   falklandicus and Plantago moorei; and two nationally threatened species,
   Acaena antarctica and Blechnum cordatum. Our research demonstrates that
   temperature increases predicted for the next century have the potential
   to significantly alter plant distributions across the Falklands. Upland
   species, in particular, were found to be highly vulnerable to climate
   change impacts. No known locations of target upland species or the
   southwestern species Plantago moorei are predicted to remain
   environmentally suitable in the face of predicted climate change. We
   identify potential refugia for these species and associated gaps in the
   current protected areas network. Species currently restricted to the
   milder western parts of the archipelago are broadly predicted to expand
   their ranges under warmer temperatures. Our results emphasise the
   importance of implementing suitable adaptation strategies to offset
   climate change impacts, particularly site management. There is an urgent
   need for long-term monitoring and artificial warming experiments; the
   results of this study will inform the selection of the most suitable
   locations for these. Results are also helping inform management
   recommendations for the Falkland Islands Government who seek to better
   conserve their biodiversity and meet commitments to multi-lateral
   environmental agreements.},

Title = {Climate change trends in Malta and related beliefs, concerns and

Abstract = {In this study we report the results obtained from an island-wide survey
   aimed at researching an under-emphasized key feature of climate change
   adaptation namely willingness to adapt on the basis of the perceptions
   and beliefs held by the Gozitan livestock and crop farmers. Some of the
   main objectives of this study included the: (1) determination of whether
   the current perception is in line with the observed climatic changes at
   the local scale, and (2) identification of the typology of these
   farmers, together with those factors that affect both skepticism and
   acceptance of climate change. This study provided an important first
   step in the objective validation of local farmers' perceptions of
   climate change, as well as in the development of a comprehensive
   understanding of their attitude, beliefs, willingness and capacity to
   adjust their practices in response to climate change. The results
   pointed to several important conclusions that can be used to inform
   research, outreach strategies and policy formulation, targeting the
   Gozitan farming sector to adapt to climate change without delay. The
   forgoing analysis showed a dire need for more information both on
   impacts and risks, as well as on ways how to introduce new farming
   techniques and practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {North Indian Ocean sea level has shown significant increase during last
   three to four decades. Analyses of long-term climate data sets and ocean
   model sensitivity experiments identify a mechanism for multidecadal sea
   level variability relative to global mean. Our results indicate that
   North Indian Ocean sea level rise is accompanied by a weakening summer
   monsoon circulation. Given that Indian Ocean meridional heat transport
   is primarily regulated by the annual cycle of monsoon winds, weakening
   of summer monsoon circulation has resulted in reduced upwelling off
   Arabia and Somalia and decreased southward heat transport, and
   corresponding increase of heat storage in the North Indian Ocean. These
   changes in turn lead to increased retention of heat and increased
   thermosteric sea level rise in the North Indian Ocean, especially in the
   Arabian Sea. These findings imply that rising North Indian Ocean sea
   level due to weakening of monsoon circulation demands adaptive
   strategies to enable a resilient South Asian population.},

Journal = {AESTIMUM},
Year = {2020},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {57-80},
Abstract = {The phenomenon of urban heat waves are becoming a significant public
   health problem in the summer season. Global warming is therefore not
   only an environmental problem, but also an ethical and political issue
   of climate justice. The research was based on the capability approach
   developed by Amartya Sen. The aim of the study is to (1) identify a set
   of indicators that allows to estimate the risk of decreased individual
   well-being; (2) implement these indicators in a probabilistic model that
   allows to explicitly consider the lack of certain knowledge on the
   effects of climate change; (3) provide high resolution urban mapping for
   climate change adaptation strategies.
   The research focused on the vulnerable people (elderly people and
   children) in the city of Rosignano Solvay.
   The combination of the results, obtained through the aggregation
   Dempster's rule, allows to identify the most critical areas on which it
   is necessary to intervene or through mitigation or urban regeneration.},

Title = {Are farmers willing to pay for participatory climate information
   services? Insights from a case study in peri-urban Khulna, Bangladesh},
Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Among technological adaptation options, climate information services
   (CIS) offers high potential as a means to offset climate change impacts
   and build resilience in farming areas of developing countries. This
   study explores the potential of CIS, by investigating the case of
   participatory CIS development in the Lower Ganges Delta of Bangladesh.
   Specifically, we examined the value farmers attached to a co-developed
   CIS as decision support tool and the price farmers were willing to pay
   for CIS subscriptions. Based on a hypothetical market for CIS, we used
   contingent valuation with a double-bounded dichotomous choice format to
   determine farmers willingness to pay (WTP) for CIS. Two samples were
   included: an experiment group of farmers exposed to and trained in CIS
   use for farm decision-making and a control group of farmers without
   prior exposure to CIS. More than 90\% of farmers in the experiment group
   expressed willingness to pay for CIS, compared to 75\% of the control
   group. The annual subscription fees farmers were willing to pay ranged
   from 970.92 taka (US \$11.45) to 1387.20 taka (\$16.36). WTP was greater
   among farmers who had participated in CIS co-development. The main
   factors influencing farmers' willingness to pay were CIS cost and prior
   exposure and training to CIS. Given that Bangladesh has more than 16.5
   million farm households, these findings suggest huge market potential
   for CIS. Based on the high potential of participatory CIS, governmental
   institutions, the private sector and social entrepreneurs are called
   upon to develop CIS for smallholders, to unlock smallholders'
   agriculture potential.},

Title = {Extreme weather layer method for implementation of nature-based
   solutions for climate adaptation: Case study S?upsk},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {842},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {One of the most severe climate risks that is expected to affect all
   regions is related to stormwater. Climate models, constructed based on
   long-term trends, show that extreme weather events such as storms,
   cloudbursts and a large rise in sea level will be significant in the
   coming decades. Moreover, even the frequency and intensity of
   ``normal{''} rainfall events, such as microbursts, are expected to be
   remarkably higher than today in some regions. The efficiency of urban
   drainage systems is affected by the land use in its whole catchment. In
   addition to the climate stress, there is ongoing continuous
   densification of urban space, resulting in more buildings and larger
   areas being covered with impervious surfaces. Planning decisions today
   approving such compaction do not consider the impacts beyond the close
   proximity of the land parcel. As a result, by following the current
   planning practices, cities are becoming extremely vulnerable to
   stormwater flooding (flash floods). This study presents a holistic and
   dynamic planning method - the Extreme Weather Layer (EWL) - that makes
   it possible to analyse the impact of a single development (e.g. paving a
   gravel parking lot with asphalt or turning an area of urban greenery
   into a shopping centre) on the performance of the urban drainage system
   and therefore on the flooding risk of the whole catchment. The EWL is
   based on a widely accepted drainage modelling engine coupled with GIS
   system and other databases which provide spatial information. Thus, the
   EWL combined with the systemic approach of turning from grey to green
   infrastructure could be a smart tool for implementing NBS solutions for
   stormwater management in climate adaptation in urban areas. This smart
   tool could indicate how much more green infrastructure is needed and
   which places in the city the mitigative NBS measures would help
   significantly.},

Abstract = {Urbanization causes various climate-related environmental problems, such
   as the urban heat island phenomenon and extreme weather. As such, the
   outdoor thermal environment is worsening in cities, and researchers are
   increasingly concerned with mitigation measures. Here, we investigated
   the influence of a major railway station and the Yangtze River on the
   local thermal environment in a city with a subtropical climate. Field
   measurements were performed in Wuhan, China, from 21 July 2017, to 25
   July 2017. The cooling effect of the Yangtze River modulated the
   surrounding urban environment substantially at night, especially in
   areas closer to the river border. During the afternoon, areas farther
   from the railway station experienced higher temperatures, that meant
   railway station showed a cooling effect. By contrast, at night, the
   temperature exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing distance, that
   meant railway station showed heat island effect. Moreover, there was a
   significant relationship between the percentage of the man-made area
   (versus natural area) and air temperature at night, where temperature
   increased with an increasing percentage of man-made area. The cooling
   effect of the Yangtze River and Wuchang railway station could be taken
   into account to mitigate the urban thermal environment in Wuhan in the
   summer.},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts such as an increase in mean temperature, change
   in precipitation patterns and sea level rise are affecting regional road
   transportation network (RRTN) in Atlantic Canada. Those impacts cause
   direct and indirect economic consequences for the network and regional
   economy. In our study, we constructed a dynamic computable general
   equilibrium model (CGEM) to trace these consequences over time. Basic
   principles of the designed CGEM are discussed and the model's
   architecture is presented. The model's elements are estimated, and the
   obtained CGEM is tested with exogenously imposed shock. Evolutionary
   dynamics of regional temperature, precipitation and sea level is
   analyzed on the basis of comprehensive time series analysis. This
   dynamics will be later imposed on the designed CGEM as external
   productivity shocks. Some preliminary cumulative economic consequences
   are evaluated in monetary terms to obtain benchmarks for the mitigation
   measures associated with future development of the RRTN.},

Title = {Conceptualisation of multiple impacts interacting in the marine
   environment using marine infrastructure as an example},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {830},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The human population is increasingly reliant on the marine environment
   for food, trade, tourism, transport, communication and other vital
   ecosystem services. These services require extensive marine
   infrastructure, all of which have direct or indirect ecological impacts
   on marine environments. The rise in global marine infrastructure has led
   to light, noise and chemical pollution, as well as facilitation of
   biological invasions. As a result, marine systems and associated species
   are under increased pressure from habitat loss and degradation,
   formation of ecological traps and increased mortality, all of which can
   lead to reduced resilience and consequently increased invasive species
   establishment. Whereas the cumulative bearings of collective human
   impacts on marine populations have previously been demonstrated, the
   multiple impacts associated with marine infrastructure have not been
   well explored. Here, building on ecological literature, we explore the
   impacts that are associated with marine infrastructure, conceptualising
   the notion of correlative, interactive and cumulative effects of
   anthropogenic activities on the marine environment. By reviewing the
   range of mitigation approaches that are currently available, we consider
   the role that eco-engineering, marine spatial planning and agent-based
   modelling plays in complementing the design and placement of marine
   structures to incorporate the existing connectivity pathways, ecological
   principles and complexity of the environment. Because the effect of
   human-induced, rapid environmental change is predicted to increase in
   response to the growth of the human population, this study demonstrates
   that the development and implementation of legislative framework,
   innovative technologies and nature-informed solutions are vital,
   preventative measures to mitigate the multiple impacts associated with
   marine infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Unregulated land-use conversion influences soil organic carbon (SOC)
   storage and sequestration causing fluctuations. As one of the most
   vulnerable regions to climate-change impact, Caribbean ecosystems
   require formulation of strong adaptation strategies to cope with the
   vagaries of climate change. Therefore, understanding SOC dynamics under
   land-use change is critical. With increasing popularity of proximal soil
   sensing (PSS), relating obtained signals to properties of interest,
   could offer time and cost-efficient procedures for characterizing
   properties. To our knowledge, no investigation has been conducted
   employing PSS using electromagnetic-induction (EMI) to characterize the
   spatial dynamics of SOC as a consequence of transitional land-use.
   Hence, our research broadens the evidence base for the characterization
   of SOC in island ecosystems. Apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
   measured by a DUALEM-1S sensor was used to characterize SOC at 0-0.3 m
   under different land-uses. Spatial maps showed that EMI was suitable for
   distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic land-uses, with
   anthropogenic land-uses generally having higher and more variable ECa
   values (Quarry = 22.8-30.5 mS m(-1), Agriculture = 5.0-11.3 mS m(-1),
   Residential = 39.2-60.0 mS m(-1), Forest = 9.3-14.5 mS m(-1), Grass =
   13.6-17.0 mS m(-1)). Natural land-uses had better soil quality
   indicating that SOC controls soil quality and varies in response to
   land-use.},

Title = {On the linkage between urban heat island and urban pollution island:
   Three-decade literature review towards a conceptual framework},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {751},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {With the doubling of urban population within the next two decades and
   the disproportionate growth of megacities, it is critical to explore the
   synergism between urban heat and pollution. In this paper, a systematic
   review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on
   the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island
   (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Koppen-Geiger climatic zones are
   perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental
   trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content
   analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of
   UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime
   variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban
   geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v)
   primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality.
   Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to
   outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or
   the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and
   urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a
   more salutogenic urban design. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Perspectives for ecosystem management based on ecosystem resilience and
   ecological thresholds against multiple and stochastic disturbances},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {395-408},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ecosystem resilience is the inherent ability to absorb various
   disturbances and reorganize while undergoing state changes to maintain
   critical functions. When ecosystem resilience is sufficiently degraded
   by disturbances, ecosystem is exposed at high risk of shifting from a
   desirable state to an undesirable state. Ecological thresholds represent
   the points where even small changes in environmental conditions
   associated with disturbances lead to switch between ecosystem states.
   There is a growing body of empirical evidence for such state transitions
   caused by anthropogenic disturbances in a variety of ecosystems.
   However, fewer studies addressed the interaction of anthropogenic and
   natural disturbances that often force an ecosystem to cross a threshold
   which an anthropogenic disturbance or a natural disturbance alone would
   not have achieved. This fact highlights how little is known about
   ecosystem dynamics under uncertainties around multiple and stochastic
   disturbances. Here, we present two perspectives for providing a
   predictive scientific basis to the management and conservation of
   ecosystems against multiple and stochastic disturbances. The first is
   management of predictable anthropogenic disturbances to maintain a
   sufficient level of biodiversity for ensuring ecosystem resilience
   (i.e., resilience-based management). Several biological diversity
   elements appear to confer ecosystem resilience, such as functional
   redundancy, response diversity, a dominant species, a foundation
   species, or a keystone species. The greatest research challenge is to
   identify key elements of biodiversity conferring ecosystem resilience
   for each context and to examine how we can manage and conserve them. The
   second is the identification of ecological thresholds along existing or
   experimental disturbance gradients. This will facilitate the development
   of indicators of proximity to thresholds as well as the understanding of
   threshold mechanisms. The implementation of forewarning indicators will
   be critical particularly when resilience-based management fails. The
   ability to detect an ecological threshold along disturbance gradients
   should therefore be essential to establish a backstop for preventing the
   threshold from being crossed. These perspectives can take us beyond
   simply invoking the precautionary principle of conserving biodiversity
   to a predictive science that informs practical solutions to cope with
   uncertainties and ecological surprises in a changing world. (C) 2015

Abstract = {In recent decades, climate change has been responsible for an increase
   in the average temperature of the troposphere and of the oceans, with
   consequences on the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather
   phenomena. Climate change's effects on natural disasters can be expected
   to induce a rise in humanitarian crises. In addition, it will surely
   impact the population's long-term general health, especially among the
   most fragile. There are foreseeable health risks that both ambulatory
   care organizations and hospitals will face as global temperatures rise.
   These risks include the geographic redistribution of infectious
   (particularly zoonotic) diseases, an increase in cardiac and respiratory
   illnesses, as well as a host of other health hazards. Some of these
   risks have been detailed for most developed countries as well as for
   some developing countries. Using these existing risk assessments as a
   template, organizational innovations as well as implementation
   strategies should be proposed to mitigate the disruptive effects of
   these health risks on emergency departments and by extension, reduce the
   negative impact of climate change on the populations they serve.},

   incomplete understanding of the processes and the difficulty of
   obtaining detailed data. Recent advances in satellite techniques have
   made it possible to obtain rich coastal data sets that provide a solid
   foundation for improving climate change adaptation strategies for
   humanity and increasing the resilience of ecosystems for sustainable
   development. In this article, we review West African coastal layout and
   current socio-environmental challenges together with key parameters that
   can be monitored and several coastal management programs that rely on
   satellite techniques to monitor indicators at the regional level. The
   social, technical and scientific problems and difficulties that hinder
   the interest of coastal practitioners and decision-makers to use the
   satellite data are identified. We provide a roadmap to precisely respond
   to these difficulties and on how an improved satellite earth observation
   strategy can better support future coastal zone management in West
   Africa.},

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {More frequent and severe heat waves rank among the most serious impacts
   of climate change in Central Europe. At the same time, increasing
   awareness of the importance of municipalities acting in climate change
   adaptation leads to a higher demand for urban climate modelling. In this
   study we use MUKLIMO\_3 model for a simulation of spatiotemporal pattern
   of air temperature in Prague and Brno. Our aim is to simulate
   theoretical land cover modifications and their potential impacts on air
   temperature during a heat wave event. The model suggests that an albedo
   increased by 0.25 leads to a difference of -0.2 degrees C in daily
   average temperature in both Prague and Brno while an albedo increased by
   0.5 leads to a daily average temperature difference of -0.5 degrees C in
   Prague and - 0.4 degrees C in Brno. Increasing the number of trees by
   30\% generally leads to higher temperatures during daytime and lower
   temperatures during night-time. In most neighbourhoods the cooling
   effect of additional trees was 0.0 degrees C to -0.2 degrees C on the
   daily average. In some cases of compact midrise development, additional
   trees might even cause an increase in temperature. This fact underlines
   the importance of careful individual assessment of adaptation measures
   before their implementation at particular locations.},

Title = {Climate change and aquaculture: considering adaptation potential},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {603-624},
Abstract = {Increases in global population and seafood demand are occurring
   simultaneously with fisheries decline in an era of rapid climate change.
   Aquaculture is well positioned to help meet the world's future seafood
   needs, but heavy reliance of most global aquaculture on the ambient
   environment and ecosystem services suggests inherent vulnerability to
   climate change effects. There are, however, opportunities for
   adaptation. Engineering and management solutions can reduce exposure to
   stressors or mitigate stressors through environmental control.
   Epigenetic adaptation may have the potential to improve stressor
   tolerance through parental or early life stage exposure.
   Stressor-resistant traits can be genetically selected for, and
   maintaining adequate population variability can improve resilience and
   overall fitness. Information at appropriate time scales is crucial for
   adaptive response, such as real-time data on stressor levels and/or
   species' responses, early warning of deleterious events, or prediction
   of longer-term change. Diet quality and quantity have the potential to
   meet increasing energetic and nutritional demands associated with
   mitigating the effects of abiotic and biotic climate change stressors.
   Research advancements in understanding how climate change affects
   aquaculture will benefit most from a combination of empirical studies,
   modelling approaches, and observations at the farm level. Research to
   support aquaculture adaptation requires an increasing amount of
   environmental data to guide biological response studies for regional
   applications. Increased experimental complexity, resources, and duration
   will be necessary to better understand the effects of multiple
   stressors. Ultimately, in order for aquaculture sectors to move beyond
   short-term coping responses, governance initiatives incorporating the
   changing needs of stakeholders, users, and culture ecosystems as a whole
   are required to facilitate planned climate change adaptation and
   mitigation.},

Abstract = {Extreme climate-driven events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires
   are becoming more intense in areas exposed to these threats, requiring
   approaches to improve the resilience of the electrical infrastructure
   serving these communities. Long-duration outages caused by such high
   impact events propagate to economic, health, and social consequences for
   communities. As essential service providers, electric utilities are
   mandated to provide safe, economical and reliable electricity to their
   customers. The public is becoming less tolerant to these more frequent
   disruptions, especially in view of technological advances that are
   intended to improve power quality, reliability and resilience. One
   promising solution is state-of-the-art microgrids and the advanced
   controls employed therein. This paper presents and demonstrates an
   approach to technoeconomic analysis that can be used to value the
   avoided economic consequences of grid resilience investments, as applied
   to the islands of Vieques and Culebra in Puerto Rico. This valuation
   methodology can support policies to incorporate resilience value into
   any investment decision-making process, especially those which serve the

Title = {Quantifying and Predicting the Contribution of Sea-Level Rise to
   Shoreline Change in Ghana: Information for Coastal Adaptation Strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to estimate the contribution of sea-level
   rise (SLR) in Ghana over the last decades and provide an estimation of
   shoreline retreat due to the projections of regional SLR. This study
   first analyzes historical shoreline change in Ghana from 1974 to 2015
   using satellite images and orthophotos. Second, this study quantifies
   the SLR contribution to historical shoreline change using sea-level
   trend estimates from satellite observations, results from digital
   elevation model analysis, and shoreline change rates. This study finally
   makes predictions of shoreline in Ghana on the basis of modified
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report
   representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios for Ghana. On
   average, sea level has risen by about 5.3 cm over the last 21 years and
   accounts for only 31\% of the observed annual coastal erosion rate
   (about 2 m/y) in Ghana. On the basis of the projected model
   ensemble-mean rise in sea-level (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 RCPs) scenarios and
   assuming that SLR will also contribute to 31\% of shoreline retreat in
   the future, by the year 2025, about 6.6, 4.7, and 5.8 m of coastland in
   Ghana with lowest slope range (0-0.4\%) are projected to be inundated
   respectively. These projected changes increase to 19.8, 20.7, and 24.3 m
   by 2050 and further to 36.6, 51.6, and 83.9 m by 2100 for the 2.6, 4.5,
   and 8.5 RCPs respectively. The analysis that separates sea-level
   contribution to coastal change from other contributing factors could
   provide useful information about climate impact for coastal adaptation
   strategies. This study, however, recommends further research into the
   anthropogenic and other factors that contribute about 69\% of the annual
   erosion rate in Ghana to help improve adaptation efforts.},

Abstract = {This paper integrates information on climate-change, hydrodynamic
   models, and geographic overlays to assess the vulnerability of coastal
   areas in Bangladesh to larger storm surges and sea-level rise (SLR) by
   2050. The approach identifies polders, coastal populations, settlements,
   infrastructure, and economic activity at risk of inundation, and
   estimates the damage from storm surge inundation versus the cost of
   several adaptation measures. A 27-centimetre SLR and 10\%
   intensification of wind speed resulting from global warming suggest that
   the vulnerable zone increases in size by 69\% given a +3-metre
   inundation depth, and by 14\% given a +1-metre inundation depth.
   Estimates indicate investments including strengthening polders,
   foreshore afforestation, additional multi-purpose cyclone shelters,
   cyclone-resistant private housing, and further strengthening of the
   early warning and evacuation system would cost more than \$2.4 billion,
   with an annual recurrent cost of more than \$50 million. These estimates
   can serve as a prototype in climate negotiations of the adaptation costs
   of extreme weather events.},

   impact over the next decade as it affects every continent is manifested
   by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand, economic competition
   for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible
   depletion of groundwater, and negative impacts on the environment.
   Jordanian water crises are exacerbating all of the time due to increased
   water demands derived from high population growth, sudden fluxes of
   refugees, economic development, and increased frequency of drought
   events. These forces stress the urgent need to develop drought
   adaptation planning based on vulnerability mapping correlated to
   prolonged weather events. The objective of this research is thus to
   generate a drought vulnerability map with an emphasis on the severity
   and probability of drought occurrence, and to propose adaption measures
   based on groundwater sector impact chain analysis by incorporating
   numerical scorings for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacities at
   groundwater basin and Jordanian district levels. Drought impacts on
   groundwater basins were investigated based on measurements of severity
   and probability of drought occurrence, and drought exposure over the
   whole country computed by means of a combined drought index (CDI) that
   included the precipitation drought index, temperature drought index, and
   vegetation drought index from 1980 to 2017. Results indicated that
   drought in Jordan is characterised by a temporal and spatial variability
   regarding probability and severity. The most prolonged drought events
   range from mild to moderate, with long periods of exposure that may
   extend for up to 13 consecutive years. Due to high groundwater basin
   sensitivity and low adaptive capacity, the groundwater systems in Jordan
   are fragile and highly vulnerable to drought impacts, being subject to
   either reduction in quantity and/or deterioration in quality over time.
   The most vulnerable groundwater basins are the Azraq and Dead Sea
   regions, while Disi and Yarmouk are also highly vulnerable groundwater
   basins based on the weak enforcement of transboundary agreements. The
   proposed drought risk management system based on this research includes
   proactive and contingency plans enabled by policies and legal frameworks
   at the national level to ensure sustainable water resilience and
   governance.},

Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise is one of the most critical issues the world faces under
   global warming. Around 680 million people (10\% of the world's
   population) live in low-lying coastal regions that are susceptible to
   flooding through storm surges and from sea-water infiltration of fresh
   groundwater reserves, degradation of farmland and accelerated coastal
   erosion, among other impacts. Rising sea level will exacerbate these
   problems and lead to societal impacts ranging from crop and water-supply
   failures to breakdowns of city infrastructures. In time, it is likely
   such changes will necessitate the migration of people with substantial
   economic cost and social upheaval. Here, we discuss the physical
   processes influencing 21(st) Century sea-level rise, the importance of
   not using 2100 alone as a benchmark, the changes that are already locked
   in, especially after 2100, and those that can be avoided. We also
   consider the need for both adaptation and mitigation measures and early
   warning systems in this challenging global problem. Finally, we discuss
   how the scientific prediction of sea level rise can improved through
   international coordination, cooperation and cost sharing.},

   design?, Sarpsborg, NORWAY, SEP 23-25, 2013},
Abstract = {Since the Middle Ages the Dutch have reclaimed many lakes and parts of
   the sea, creating polders. Drainage is required to use the land: for the
   inhabitants, for agriculture and for nature. Traditionally drainage was
   by gravity: through open (and later pipe) drains excess rainfall was
   transferred into open collector drains, from where the water was pumped
   out to a river, lake or the sea. Since the 1950s, land use has been
   changing towards a more diverse and intensive agriculture, more
   attention for nature, recreation and continuing urbanization. On top of
   this, the climate is changing: significant increases in precipitation,
   both average and extreme. Until recently, the solution to more excess
   water was to increase pump capacity. Yet the combined problems of
   climate change, sea level rise, subsidence and urbanization require more
   structural changes in water management. Drainage systems have to be
   modified to enable the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all
   excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually
   in each agricultural plot. A new approach of `retention, storage and
   controlled removal' is being used to develop climate adaptation
   scenarios for the three hydro-ecological zones in the Netherlands, i.e.:
   (1) the man-made polder areas with marine clay soils along the North Sea
   coast and the former Zuider Sea; (2) the low-lying peat lands in the
   west and north; and (3) the sandy and loamy soils areas in the centre,
   south and east. New approaches for tailor-made drainage solutions
   following this strategy are being tested in various pilot areas in the
   three zones. Although the research is still ongoing, this paper presents
   the lessons learned to date related to the challenges, risks and
   limitations associated with the introduction of these new drainage
   strategies for coping with climate change in the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {Cool roofs and green roofs are two important methods used to mitigate
   the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The Weather Research and Forecasting
   Model was used to investigate the UHI effect and the effectiveness of
   cool and green roof mitigation strategies in the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou
   metropolitan area during an extreme heat wave episode in the summer of
   2013. Both urban land-cover change and anthropogenic heat releases
   exacerbated high temperatures in the urban area. Notably, urban
   land-cover change and anthropogenic heat release were responsible for
   64\% and 36\% of the UHI intensity, respectively. Both cool and green
   roofs decreased near-surface air temperatures. The most dramatic
   decrease in near-surface air temperature occurred in the late morning;
   nocturnal air temperature decreased slightly because of the decrease in
   urban heat storage associated with the cool roof strategy. In addition,
   the UHI mitigation strategies affected the entire urban boundary layer.
   The decrease in the potential temperature and static stability created a
   stable urban boundary layer in which turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
   decreased simultaneously. Analysis of an urban belt near a large water
   body showed that the decrease in the surface skin temperature difference
   between land and the water body weakened the daytime lake breeze. This
   effect was observed in both the inflow in the boundary layer and the
   return flow above the boundary layer, and it decreased the heat and
   moisture exchange between the lake and land boundary layers.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, human societies have had to effectively devise ways
   and means to adapt to climate variability by altering their lifestyles,
   agriculture, settlements and other critical aspects of their economies
   and livelihoods. The capacity to adapt enables societies to deal with a
   range of uncertainties. Coping and adaptation is a way of life in
   Nigeria, where climate variability is the norm and where planting cycles
   in a largely rain-fed agricultural system are affected by reoccurring
   droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. Climate change
   scenarios for Nigeria suggest a warmer climate and projected changes in
   precipitation suggest it will be wetter in the south along the coast and
   drier in the northeast. The climate models also suggest more extreme
   heat events will occur. Resource dependent people, such as farmers,
   hunters and fishers, who depend directly on the productivity of natural
   resources around them for their livelihoods, are the first to be
   impacted by these changes in local environmental conditions. The
   Government of Nigeria is a signatory to the UNFCCC and there is an
   initiative underway to develop a national strategy for community-based
   climate change adaptation. Since 2007, the Nigerian Environmental
   Study/Action Team (NEST) is an NGO has been implementing the project
   Building Nigeria's Response to Climate Change (BNRCC). Pilot Projects
   are one component of BNRCC, and are designed to test adaptation options
   on a small scale in order to strengthen the resilience of communities to
   climate change, increase their adaptive capacity and provide
   recommendations based on lessons learned from community-based adaptation
   projects to the national strategy. The projects involve seven partner
   organizations who are working directly with 15 vulnerable communities
   spanning Nigeria from the Sahel in the north east to the
   Coastal/Rainforest in the south east. The projects include but are not
   restricted to: increasing food security by introducing improved crop
   varieties; testing alternative livelihood options such as aquaculture in
   order to provide a means of income and decrease reliance on dwindling
   forest resources; providing fuel efficient wood stoves; improving access
   to water sources to deal with water scarcity; and tree planting for
   ecosystem rehabilitation.},

Title = {Ecomimicry in Indigenous resource management: optimizing ecosystem
   services to achieve resource abundance, with examples from Hawai'i},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Here, we expand on the term ``ecomimicry{''} to be an umbrella concept
   for an approach to adaptive ecosystem-based management of
   social-ecological systems that simultaneously optimizes multiple
   ecosystem services for the benefit of people and place. In this context,
   we define ecomimicry as a strategy for developing and managing cultural
   landscapes, built upon a deep understanding of the structure and
   function of ecosystems, that harnesses ecosystem processes for the
   purpose of balancing and sustaining key ecosystem services, rather than
   maximizing one service (e.g., food production) to the detriment of
   others. Ecomimicry arises through novel, place-based innovations or is
   adopted from elsewhere and adapted to local conditions. Similarly,
   precontact Hawaiian social-ecological systems integrated a variety of
   ecomimicry schema to engender a complex system of adaptive resource
   management that enhanced biocultural diversity and supported resilient
   food systems, ultimately sustaining a thriving human population. In
   addition to presenting a synopsis of how ecomimicry was employed in the
   design and management of Hawaiian social-ecological systems, we identify
   and characterize specific ecomimicry applications. Within this context,
   we explore a revival of ecomimicry for biological conservation,
   biocultural restoration, resilience, and food security. We conclude with
   a discussion of how revitalizing such an approach in the restoration of
   social-ecological systems may address issues of conservation and
   sustainability in the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a synthesis of the recent literature describing how
   global biodiversity is being affected by climate change and is projected
   to respond in the future. Current studies reinforce earlier findings of
   major climate-change-related impacts on biological systems and document
   new, more subtle after-effects. For example, many species are shifting
   their distributions and phenologies at faster rates than were recorded
   just a few years ago; however, responses are not uniform across species.
   Shifts have been idiosyncratic and in some cases counterintuitive,
   promoting new community compositions and altering biotic interactions.
   Although genetic diversity enhances species' potential to respond to
   variable conditions, climate change may outpace intrinsic adaptive
   capacities and increase the relative vulnerabilities of many organisms.
   Developing effective adaptation strategies for biodiversity conservation
   will not only require flexible decision-making and management approaches
   that account for uncertainties in climate projections and ecological
   responses but will also necessitate coordinated monitoring efforts.},

Title = {Future Socio-Political Scenarios for Aquatic Resources in Europe: A
   Common Framework Based on Shared-Socioeconomic-Pathways (SSPs)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {It has proven extremely challenging for researchers to predict with
   confidence how human societies might develop in the future, yet managers
   and industries need to make projections in order to test adaptation and
   mitigation strategies designed to build resilience to long-term shocks.
   This paper introduces exploratory scenarios with a particular focus on
   European aquaculture and fisheries and describes how these scenarios
   were designed. Short-, mediumand long-term developments in
   socio-political drivers may be just as important in determining profits,
   revenues and prospects in the aquaculture and fisheries industries as
   physical drivers such as longterm climate change. Four
   socio-political-economic futures were developed, based partly on the
   IPCC SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) framework and partly
   on the newer system of Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). `Off the
   shelf' narrative material as well as quantitative outputs were
   `borrowed' from earlier frameworks but supplemented with material
   generated through in-depth stakeholder workshops involving industry and
   policy makers. Workshop participants were tasked to outline how they
   thought their sector might look under the four future worlds and, in
   particular, to make use of the PESTEL conceptual framework (Political,
   Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) as an aide
   memoire to help define the scope of each scenario. This work was carried
   out under the auspices of the EU Horizon 2020 project CERES (Climate
   change and European aquatic RESources), and for each `CERES scenario'
   (World Markets, National Enterprise, Global Sustainability and Local
   Stewardship), additional quantitative outputs were generated, including
   projections of future fuel and fish prices, using the MAGNET (Modular
   Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool) modeling framework. In developing and
   applying the CERES scenarios, we have demonstrated that the basic
   architecture is sufficiently flexible to be used at a wide diversity of
   scales. We urge the climate science community to adopt a similar
   scenarios framework, based around SSPs, to facilitate global
   cross-comparison of fisheries and aquaculture model outputs more broadly
   and to harmonize communication regarding potential future bioeconomic
   impacts of climate change.},

Abstract = {One of the most discernible impacts of climate change is the increasing
   severity and unpredictability of extreme weather conditions. Small
   island developing states are particularly vulnerable to these
   conditions, with one of the impacts being on energy supplies due to
   damaging energy infrastructure, resulting in power outages and economic
   losses. Drawing on resilience theory to frame the discourse, we present
   an updated overview of how island energy infrastructures have been and
   continue to be negatively impacted. This same framework also provides a
   lens through which we identify the challenges involved in recovery,
   rebuilding and returning energy security in these contexts.},

Year = {2019},

Number = {6425},
Pages = {363+},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and effective
   management have begun to fulfill the promise of recovery in the ocean.
   However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part
   because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them
   are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in
   marine social- ecological systems where large- scale dynamics can
   inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an
   inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of
   stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem
   outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible
   recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and
   (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with
   rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional
   scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful
   recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social
   imperatives are constantly shifting.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, the inevitable increase in temperature has caused
   Malaysia to experience more extreme heat events, and yet very little
   research has been dedicated in exploring the heat-related vulnerability
   of exposed population. In this study, the extreme heat vulnerability
   index (EHVI) has been evaluated to identify the most vulnerable
   districts to extreme heat events. We evaluated exposure, population
   sensitivity and adaptive capacity from sociodemographic and remote
   sensing data. We have applied multivariate analysis on 13 indicators for
   every 87 districts to elucidate the extreme heat vulnerability in
   Peninsular Malaysia. The EHVI was generated by summing up the normalized
   extreme heat exposure scores and factor scores from the multivariate
   analysis. Our findings clarify that the most vulnerable populations are
   confined in the urban and northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. The
   source of vulnerability varied between both regions, with urbanization
   and population density increase the vulnerability in urban areas, high
   heat exposure and sensitive population are the dominant factors of
   vulnerability in the northern region. These findings are valuable in
   identifying districts vulnerable to extreme heat and help regulatory
   body; in designing effective adaptation and preparedness strategies to
   increase the population resilience towards extreme heat.},

Title = {Integrating Climate Change into Hazard Mitigation Planning: A Survey of
   State Hazard Mitigation Officers},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The increased number of catastrophic disasters in the United States in
   recent decades has been accompanied by consequences of climate change,
   including rising sea levels, floods, storms, extreme temperatures,
   drought, and wildfires. Climate change and extreme events are
   interrelated, and climate change is likely to lead to more frequent and
   severe hazards. Hazard mitigation offers tools to address the hazards
   that are influenced by climate change and minimize community-level
   exposure or vulnerability. State Hazard Mitigation Officers in the 56
   U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia involved in
   FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program were surveyed to assess the
   extent to which climate change has been integrated into State Hazard
   Mitigation Plans (SHMPs) and the barriers and facilitators to such
   climate change integration. The majority of responding states reported
   integration of climate change into SHMPs, and increased climate change
   projection evidence was commonly cited as a driver of such integration.
   However, lack of funding and competing hazard mitigation priorities were
   the most commonly reported barriers to integration. Political
   prioritization was reported as both a barrier to and facilitator of
   integration. There is an ongoing need to effectively translate climate
   change research to practitioners to support evidence-based hazard
   mitigation policy and practice.},

Title = {Thin-layer sediment addition to an existing salt marsh to combat
   sea-level rise and improve endangered species habitat in California, USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {197-208},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Current tidal marsh elevations and their accretion rates are important
   predictors of vulnerability to sea-level rise. When tidal marshes are at
   risk, adaptation measures, such as sediment addition to increase
   elevations, can be implemented to prevent degradation and loss. In 2016,
   wildlife managers prescribed a thin-layer sediment addition of locally
   sourced dredged material from Anaheim Bay to mitigate plausible future
   impacts of sea-level rise to Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge, an
   urbanized, subsiding, sediment limited, and low elevation tidal marsh in
   southern California, USA. In this study, our objectives were to
   determine how suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and fluxes
   associated with sediment application affected an adjacent eelgrass bed
   and a more distant deep tidal channel at different time periods
   throughout the project and how sediment application affected tidal marsh
   elevation. Due to the sediment addition the tidal marsh elevation
   increased by 25.4 cm across 3.06 ha. Mean SSC levels at the eelgrass
   site increased from 4 mg/L during pre-augmentation to 16 mg/L during
   sediment application. SSC levels also increased up to 40 mg/L with the
   installation of sediment barriers. Winter storms during construction
   also had an influence on SSC, with an extreme storm event increasing SSC
   from 9 mg/L pre-storm levels to 16 mg/L during the storm. However, SSC
   at the deep site remained constant during all time periods with a mean
   of 7 mg/L. Our results show that little to zero sediment was exported
   out of Anaheim Bay during the study period, illustrating that any
   impacts were localized to the application area. These findings suggest
   that although long-range export of applied dredge material is unlikely
   from future thin-layer sediment application at this site, adjacent
   habitats could experience impacts if erosion control measures are not
   implemented effectively. Future projects will benefit from similar pre-
   and post-addition monitoring to establish the long-term efficacy of
   sea-level rise adaptation measures.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The paper assesses evidence concerning the effects of transportation's
   black carbon emissions on climate change, public health, and food
   production; and it discusses policy issues posed by the emissions. Black
   carbon emission mitigation policies at all levels offer significant
   potential climate, health, and food co-benefits, and they are attractive
   in terms of economic cost-effectiveness and political feasibility. The
   paper presents an analysis of regulatory issues in maritime shipping and
   aviation, which are increasingly salient, and which are largely
   independent of the revelations of ``diesel gate{''} in the motor vehicle
   industry. Yet, there are linkages in the technological and policy issues
   of the motor vehicle industry and issues confronting maritime shipping
   and aviation. Black carbon emissions are among the core regulatory
   policy issues in all three industries, and they have not been adequately
   addressed by policymakers. The paper concludes with specific policy
   recommendations at all governance levels.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {522-543},
Abstract = {We tested a structural model that integrates protection motivation
   theory with the individual's (farmer's) climate change adaptation
   process. The model helps us grasp the effects of climate change
   perception and hypothetical shifts in destination attractiveness, as
   well as threat and coping appraisals in light of tourists' adaptation
   intentions in coastal destinations. We collected a total of 333 on-site
   valid questionnaires from domestic tourists at Kenting National Park in
   Taiwan and analysed the structural relationships in the aforementioned
   study constructs using structural equation modelling. Our findings show
   that when tourists have a higher level of perception regarding global
   climate change, they believe that destination attractiveness will
   decrease. When presented with scenarios of hypothetical shifts in
   destination attractiveness, tourists with higher levels of adaptation
   intention will perceive greater levels of threat to tourism behaviours,
   as well as higher effectiveness in adaptive measures. We confirmed that
   the proposed theoretical framework for tourists' adaptation intention
   toward climate change is useful; the framework also sheds light on
   tourists' acknowledgement of hypothetical alterations in destination
   attractiveness caused by climate change, in addition to their
   psychological adaptations. We discuss theoretical and practical
   implications.},

Abstract = {The ocean sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2), direct injection of CO2
   into bathypelagic layers, is one of the climate change mitigation
   options. It is essential to assess the potential environmental impacts
   on the marine ecosystem. In bathypelagic layers, bacteria are dominant
   organisms and play significant roles in oceanic carbon cycling through
   utilization and transformation of organic matter. We performed
   laboratory experiments by acidifying bathypelagic seawater with CO2 gas
   or buffer solutions to examine the impact on bacterial activities
   (abundance, production rate, and proportion of viable cells). In the
   laboratory experiments, we observed some potential effects by artificial
   changes in CO2 concentration, pH, or both, on bacterial activities. It
   was suggested that trophic conditions of bacterial assemblage strongly
   influence the magnitude of the impacts on bacterial activities and
   metabolisms by CO2 sequestration.},

Abstract = {Operational probabilistic (ensemble) forecasts made at ECMWF during the
   European summer heat wave of 2003 indicate significant skill on medium
   (3-10 day) and monthly (10-30 day) time scales. A more general
   ``unified{''} analysis of many medium-range, monthly, and seasonal
   forecasts confirms a high degree of probabilistic forecast skill for
   European temperatures over the first month. The unified analysis also
   identifies seasonal predictability for Europe, which is not yet realized
   in seasonal forecasts. Interestingly, the initial atmospheric state
   appears to be important even for month 2 of a coupled forecast.
   Seasonal coupled model forecasts capture the general level of observed
   European deterministic predictability associated with the persistence of
   anomalies. A review is made of the possibilities to improve seasonal
   forecasts. This includes multimodel and probabilistic techniques and the
   potential for ``windows of opportunity{''} where better representation
   of the effects of boundary conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature and
   soil moisture) may improve forecasts. ``Perfect coupled model{''}
   potential predictability estimates are sensitive to the coupled model
   used and so it is not yet possible to estimate ultimate levels of
   seasonal predictability.
   The impact of forecast information on different users with different
   mitigation strategies (i.e., ways of coping with a weather or climate
   event) is investigated. The importance of using forecast information to
   reduce volatility as well as reducing the expected expense is
   highlighted. The possibility that weather forecasts can affect the cost
   of mitigating actions is considered. The simplified analysis leads to
   different conclusions about the usefulness of forecasts that could guide
   decisions about the development of ``end-to-end{''} (forecast-to-user
   decision) systems.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},

Volume = {16},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {659-672},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The impact of mid-century climatic changes on crop productivity of
   winter wheat, maize, potato and sugar beet was assessed for a temperate
   maritime climate in the Flemish Region, Belgium. Climatic projections of
   multiple regional and global climate models (RCMs from the EU-ENSEMBLES
   project and GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3)
   were stochastically downscaled by the LARS-WG weather generator for use
   in the crop models AquaCrop and Sirius. Primarily positive effects on
   mean yield were simulated. Crops benefitted from elevated CO2, and from
   more radiation interception if the cropping period was adapted in
   response to higher temperatures. However, increased productivity was
   linked with increased susceptibility to water stress and greater
   inter-annual yield variability, particularly with adapted management.
   Impacts differed among and within ensembles of climate models, and among
   crops and environments. Although RCMs may be more suitable for local
   impact assessments than GCMs, inter-ensemble differences and contingent
   wider ranges of impacts with GCM projections found in this study
   indicate that applying RCMs driven by a limited number of GCMs alone
   would not give the full range of possible impacts. Further, this study
   suggests that the simulated intermodel variation can be larger than

Abstract = {Background: The impact of climate change on public health may occur
   through a number of main pathways including increased temperature,
   ground-level ozone levels and ultra-violet radiation, which have a range
   of consequences for human health. One strategy for adaptation to the
   predicted effects of climate change on health that has been proposed, is
   to `green' urban areas, essentially by increasing the abundance and
   cover of vegetation. This protocol is for an update of a systematic
   review which aimed to address the question: How effective is `greening'
   of urban areas in reducing human exposure to ground-level ozone
   concentrations, UV exposure and the `urban heat island effect'?
   Methods: A sensitive search of multiple databases and relevant journals
   for relevant published articles will be conducted. A search for relevant
   unpublished articles will be undertaken through an internet search and
   of websites of relevant organisations. Inclusion criteria will be
   applied at title, abstract and full-text. Repeatability checks of this
   screening process will be undertaken. Articles included at full-text
   will be critically appraised using a standardised checklist. A
   repeatability check will be made of this process. Pre-defined data items
   will be extracted from included articles. If appropriate, quantitative
   synthesis will be undertaken through meta-analysis and/or a narrative
   synthesis will be undertaken.},

Abstract = {The disaster management principles should be integrated into the
   destination management plans to enhance resilience of tourist
   destinations to natural disasters. The success of such integration
   depends on the extent of tourism stakeholder collaboration, but this
   topic remains understudied, especially in the Caribbean. This paper
   evaluates tourism resilience in Grenada. It finds that local tourism
   stakeholders are well aware of the potential damage natural disasters
   can inflict on the destination but fail to develop effective measures to
   build destination-wide and organizational resilience. The paper proposes
   an action framework to aid tourism stakeholders in Grenada to more
   effectively plan for disasters.},

Abstract = {Downscaling from the predictions of general climate models is critical
   to current strategies for mitigating species loss caused by climate
   change. A key impediment to this downscaling is that we lack a fully
   developed understanding of how variation in physical, biological, or
   land-use characteristics mediates the effects of climate change on
   ecological communities within regions. We analyzed change in understory
   herb communities over a 60-y period (1949/1951-2007/ 2009) in a complex
   montane landscape (the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon) where mean
   temperatures have increased 2 degrees C since 1948, similar to
   projections for other terrestrial communities. Our 185 sites included
   primary and secondary-growth lower montane forests (500-1.200 m above
   sea level) and primary upper montane to sub-alpine forests (1,500-2,100
   m above sea level). In lower montane forests, regardless of land-use
   history, we found multiple herb-community changes consistent with an
   effectively drier climate, including lower mean specific leaf area,
   lower relative cover by species of northern biogeographic affinity, and
   greater compositional resemblance to communities in southerly
   topographic positions. At higher elevations we found qualitatively
   different and more modest changes, including increases in herbs of
   northern biogeographic affinity and in forest canopy cover. Our results
   provide community level validation of predicted nonlinearities in
   climate change effects.},

Title = {Limited integration of biodiversity within climate policy: Evidence from
   the Alliance of Small Island States},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {216-227},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change and biodiversity loss are deeply intertwined
   anthropogenic global crises, for which forests provide powerful
   nature-based solutions. Biodiverse forests are more resilient to climate
   change than monocultures, thereby enhancing long-term carbon storage and
   ecosystem-based adaptation. Awareness of these interdependencies is
   slowly growing, but we know little about how countries are considering
   biodiversity within climate policies. Island and low-lying coastal
   states are particularly vulnerable to climate change and biodiversity
   loss. Here we assessed if and how the members of the Alliance of Small
   Island States (AOSIS) are integrating biodiversity into their national
   climate action plans through forest-based climate solutions. Our
   analysis shows that these solutions are a missed opportunity for
   tackling the twin crises together. Only five of the 39 countries explore
   co-benefits and synergies between forest-based climate solutions and
   biodiversity conservation measures. An additional nine mention them
   separately. Among these 14 countries, only a narrow range of
   interventions were proposed. While 28 AOSIS members prioritised forests
   for combating climate change, mostly for mitigation, only three
   prioritised their unique and globally important biodiversity. This
   omission is potentially risky, since mitigation measures, such as
   planting rapidly growing non-native trees, can have negative outcomes
   for biodiversity. Climate action plans must place a greater emphasis on
   concrete and measurable targets that create synergies with biodiversity
   conservation, including through the protection of old-growth forests and
   forest restoration. Our results highlight that forums such as the United
   Nations Climate Change Conferences need to continue pushing for a
   stronger integration of biodiversity into climate policies.},

Title = {Carbon sequestration and the role of biological carbon mitigation: A
   review.},

Volume = {21},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 levels have become much
   debated environmental issues in recent years. Point source emissions of
   CO2 from industrialised processes such as power generation and cement
   production account for much of this increase. Direct carbon
   sequestration and storage techniques such as geological injection have
   large storage capacities, however these methods are very cost
   inefficient and have not been proved safe for long term sequestration. A
   novel approach to offsetting emissions is through direct biological
   carbon mitigation where CO2 from the flue gases of point sources is used
   to cultivate photosynthetic autotrophic organisms. The produced biomass
   can subsequently be converted into biofuels, bio-chemicals, food or
   animal feed. These useful by-products provide revenue to finance the
   carbon mitigation process. Large-scale cultivation of biological media
   on site at a power generation plant means that substantial amounts of
   biomass could be readily available for co-firing in the plant, thus
   decreasing the demand for fossil fuels. This review gives an overview of
   the most suitable strains of microalgae for the purpose of carbon
   mitigation while the challenges associated with carbon mitigation
   strategies such as capital costs, environmental issues, and cultivation
   of microalgae using flue gases will also be assessed. Selected media
   will be required to have a high CO2 fixing rate, a rapid growth rate,
   while being easily cultivated on a large scale in order to generate a
   large biomass yield and produce valuable by-products to offset the costs
   of carbon mitigation. An economic balance is also discussed to give an
   indication of the cost benefits in the implementation of biological
   carbon mitigation policies as a solution to the high capital and running
   costs of large scale microalgal production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {One of the most challenging issues in fisheries management is the
   evaluation of the effects of fishing in the context of a changing
   environment. Using the pronghorn spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus)
   fishery off the eastern coast of Taiwan as an example, we developed an
   individual-based model (IBM) that is capable of describing the
   temperature-dependent life history processes and fishery practices for
   the spiny lobster. We then used the model to evaluate potential impacts
   of increased ocean temperature on the estimation of mortality-based
   biological reference points for fisheries management. We demonstrate
   that a warming temperature would increase the yield-per-recruit and
   eggs-per-recruit values and consequently reduce the risk of
   overexploitation under the current exploitation level. However, there is
   likely a high risk of overexploitation in the long term if higher
   temperatures induce extra-high natural mortality. The evaluation of
   effectiveness of size regulations suggests that increasing minimum legal
   size is proposed as a good candidate measure to reduce the risk of
   overexploitation for pessimistically unfavorable environmental
   conditions. This study suggests that an explicit incorporation of the
   relationships between environmental variables and biological processes
   can greatly improve fisheries assessment and management.},

Abstract = {The south part of the San Francisco Bay Area is home to millions of
   people. Climate change is one of the main environmental issues in
   California. Sea level rise has been observed globally, forcing local
   municipalities and regions to develop adaptive strategies. In this
   study, sea level rise inundation areas were diagnosed on several levels
   over the next 50 years using topographic and geographical information,
   including hydrology analysis. A high rate of precipitation has been
   observed in the southwest Bay Area for the past five years where
   rainfall, as an extreme natural event, caused flash flooding. The flow
   direction is towards the City of San Jose which faces a high risk of
   urban flooding. In this study, a series of thematic maps were created to
   represent the flooding risk.},

Title = {Sustainable management of migratory European ducks: finding model
   species},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Eurasian migratory duck species represent a natural resource shared
   between European countries. As is evident throughout human harvest
   history, lack of coordinated management and monitoring at appropriate
   levels often leads to `the tragedy of the commons', where shared
   populations suffer overexploitation. Effective management can also be
   hampered by poor understanding of the factors that limit and regulate
   migratory populations throughout their flyways, and over time. Following
   decades of population increase, some European duck populations now show
   signs of levelling off or even decline, underlining the need for more
   active and effective management. In Europe, the existing mechanisms for
   delivering effective management of duck populations are limited, despite
   the need and enthusiasm for establishing adaptive management (AM)
   schemes for wildlife populations. Existing international legal
   agreements already oblige European countries to sustainably manage
   migratory waterbirds. Although the lack of coordinated demographic and
   hunting data remains a challenge to sustainable management planning, AM
   provides a robust decision-making framework even in the presence of
   uncertainty regarding demographic and other information. In this paper
   we investigate the research and monitoring needs in Europe to
   successfully apply AM to ducks, and search for possible model species,
   focusing on freshwater species (in contrast to sea duck species) in the
   East Atlantic flyway. Based on current knowledge, we suggest that common
   teal Anas crecca, Eurasian wigeon Mareca penelope and common goldeneye
   Bucephala clangula represent the best species for testing the
   application of an AM muddling approach to duck populations in Europe.
   Applying AM to huntable species with relatively good population data as
   models for broader implementation represents a cost effective way of
   starting to develop AM on a European flyway scale for ducks, and
   potentially other waterbirds in the future.},

   from Togoru, Fiji},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many low-lying communities around the world are increasingly
   experiencing coastal hazard risks. As such, climate-related relocation
   has received significant global attention as an adaptation response.
   However, emerging cases of populations resisting relocation in
   preference for remaining in place are emerging. This paper provides an
   account of residents of Togoru, a low-lying coastal settlement on Viti
   Levu Island, Fiji. Despite facing significant coastal impacts in the
   form of coastal erosion, tidal inundation, and saltwater intrusion,
   Togoru residents are opposing plans for relocation; instead opting for
   in-situ adaptation. We conceptualize place-belongingness to a land and
   people-through personal, historic and ancestral, relational, cultural,
   economic, and legal connections-as critical to adaptation and mobility
   decision-making. We argue that for adaptation strategies to be
   successful and sustainable, they must acknowledge the values,
   perspectives, and preferences of local people and account for the
   tangible and intangible connections to a place.},

Abstract = {There is a need for scientific knowledge on the spatiotemporal
   variability of drought episodes to establish robust drought mitigation
   and adaptation strategies. This study evaluates the spatiotemporal
   variability of drought episodes in southeastern Ethiopia at multiple
   time scales (3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month and three spatially different wet
   seasons; March-May, June-September and September-November). Drought
   indices were generated for 34 stations using the standardized
   precipitation index (SPI). The results show that the frequency and
   magnitude of drought episodes do not have a clear spatial pattern among
   nearby stations. The 12- and 24-month SPI confirm that there has not
   been a year without drought (SPI <= -1) between 1970 and 2015 at some
   stations in the study area. The trend tests show that drought magnitude,
   duration and geographical coverage are increasing. The increasing trends
   in drought magnitude at the annual, 24-month and during the March-May
   season were statistically significant at 0.05 level. Drought duration at
   3-month time scale also showed a statistically significant increase. The
   results of this study provide relevant drought information at multiple
   time scales that is useful for supporting drought management in the
   southeastern Ethiopia.},

Abstract = {The first and strongest signs of global-scale climate change exist in
   the high latitudes of the planet. Evidence is now accumulating that the
   Arctic is warming, and responses are being observed across physical,
   biological, and social systems. The impact of climate change on
   oceanographic, sea-ice, and atmospheric processes is demonstrated in
   observational studies that highlight changes in temperature and
   salinity, which influence global oceanic circulation, also known as
   thermohaline circulation, as well as a continued decline in sea-ice
   extent and thickness, which influences communication between oceanic and
   atmospheric processes. Perspectives from Inuvialuit community
   representatives who have witnessed the effects of climate change
   underline the rapidity with which such changes have occurred in the
   North. An analysis of potential future impacts of climate change on
   marine and terrestrial ecosystems underscores the need for the
   establishment of effective adaptation strategies in the Arctic.
   Initiatives that link scientific knowledge and research with traditional
   knowledge are recommended to aid Canada's northern communities in
   developing such strategies.},

Abstract = {The potential of Blue Carbon as an integral part of global climate
   change adaptation and mitigation strategies requires quantification of
   drivers and rates of organic carbon (OC) burial and storage. However,
   there is limited recognition of how land use impacts benthic
   assemblages, their bioturbation potential, and OC burial in mangrove
   forests and tidal flats. Here we evaluated the effects of mangrove
   deforestation on benthic bioturbation potential (BPc), sediment
   accretion rates (SARs), and OC and total nitrogen (TN) burial in
   mangrove soils and tidal flat sediments from three estuaries in tropical
   Brazil. SARs based on Pb-210 dating varied significantly among
   undisturbed estuaries (2.1-18.6 mm yr(-1)) and the OC and TN burial
   rates were respectively 46\% and 16\% higher than global averages. The
   cleared mangrove sites had a twofold lower SAR, 40-fold lower OC burial,
   and over 100-fold lower TN burial when compared to undisturbed forests,
   revealing the pervasive impacts of land use. Variation in benthic
   assemblage structure and BPc among sites suggests that the composition
   and activity of macrofaunal communities may facilitate OC burial in some
   cases, yet the global extent and significance of bioturbation requires
   further study. Our work reveals a strong spatial variability in C burial
   in undisturbed mangrove forests and a decreased capacity of mangroves to
   accumulate C and sediments due to land use effects.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the likely impact of extreme weather events and
   rising sea levels on key port logistics operations and infrastructure.
   It develops a 3D model to assess the vulnerability of seaports vis-a-vis
   operational assets to sea-level rise. Key operational assets were first
   identified and geo-referenced on a high-resolution digital terrain
   model. In addition, perceptions of threat of extreme weather events on
   port operations were also evaluated. The spatial model provides an
   innovative, flexible and visual representation of sea-level rise under
   different climate scenarios with the capability of mapping vulnerability
   of port assets relative to their location. The visual outputs provide
   the capacity to develop evidence-based adaptation strategies to adjust
   or retreat to respond to the risk of sea-level rise and related
   flooding. It is recommended that new infrastructure development should
   revisit design standards, specifications and procurement of assets that
   are more resilient and climate proof.},

Title = {Effects of Recent Minimum Temperature and Water Deficit Increases on
   Pinus pinaster Radial Growth and Wood Density in Southern Portugal},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Western Iberia has recently shown increasing frequency of drought
   conditions coupled with heatwave events, leading to exacerbated limiting
   climatic conditions for plant growth. It is not clear to what extent
   wood growth and density of agroforestry species have suffered from such
   changes or recent extreme climate events. To address this question,
   tree-ring width and density chronologies were built for a Pious pinaster
   stand in southern Portugal and correlated with climate variables,
   including the minimum, mean and maximum temperatures and the number of
   cold days. Monthly and maximum daily precipitations were also analyzed
   as well as dry spells. The drought effect was assessed using the
   standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration (SPEI) multi-scalar
   drought index, between 1 to 24-months. The climate-growth/density
   relationships were evaluated for the period 1958-2011. We show that both
   wood radial growth and density highly benefit from the strong decay of
   cold days and the increase of minimum temperature. Yet the benefits are
   hindered by long-term water deficit, which results in different levels
   of impact on wood radial growth and density. Despite of the
   intensification of long-term water deficit, tree ring width appears to
   benefit from the minimum temperature increase, whereas the effects of
   long-term droughts significantly prevail on tree-ring density. Our
   results further highlight the dependency of the species on deep water
   sources after the juvenile stage. The impact of climate changes on
   long-term droughts and their repercussion on the shallow groundwater
   table and P pinaster's vulnerability are also discussed. This work
   provides relevant information for forest management in the semi-arid
   area of the Alentejo region of Portugal. It should ease the elaboration
   of mitigation strategies to assure P. pinaster's production capacity and
   quality in response to more arid conditions in the near future in the
   region.},

   vulnerabilities},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Climate change has become a global burden, requiring strong
   institutional quality and willingness to mitigate future impacts. Though
   emissions are transboundary and have the tendency of spreading from high
   emitting countries to low emitting countries, regional exposure,
   sensitivity, and adaptation readiness determine the extent of climate
   effects. The existing literature focuses on immediate drivers and
   damages of emission effects, failing to account for underlying
   mechanisms occurring via the nexus between emission levels, economic,
   social, and governance adaptation readiness. Here, this study broadens
   the scope of previous attempts and simultaneously examines climate
   change vulnerability across sectors including ecosystem services, food,
   health, human habitat, infrastructure, and water. We use the Romano-Wolf
   technique to test multiple hypotheses and present the spatial-temporal
   severity of climate vulnerability and readiness to combat climate change
   and its impacts. Besides, we assess the long-term impact of climate
   change readiness and income expansion on sectoral-climate
   vulnerabilities. We find that high-income economies with high social,
   governance, and economic readiness have low climate vulnerability
   whereas developing economies with low income have high climate change
   exposure and sensitivity. Our empirical evidence could be used to
   prioritize limited resources in addressing and managing adaptive actions
   of extreme climate change vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of climate change on the bio-economic
   performance of Bay of Biscay mixed fisheries and explores the capacity
   of alternative management strategies to cope with these impacts. A
   dynamic multi-species, multi-class, multi-fleet model is developed and
   calibrated using available biological, economic and environmental
   information for French fleets. Fishing and economic data have been
   collected within the European Data Collection Framework. Climate
   represented by the sea surface temperature is assumed to affect species
   recruitment. Three management strategies are compared in terms of
   bio-economic outcomes: the Status-Quo (SQ), a Multi-species Maximum
   Sustainable Yield (MMSY) strategy and a Multi-species Maximum Economic
   Yield (MMEY) strategy. These strategies are ranked with respect to two
   contrasted scenarios regarding the Representative Concentration Pathways
   (RCP) driving climate change. Results show that the SQ strategy is not
   sustainable and is characterized by a major decline of the key
   commercial species. By contrast, the MMSY strategy improves the
   ecological state and economic performance of the fishery. The MMEY
   strategy yields even greater bio-economic improvements. Bio-economic
   benefits are however altered by the effects of climate change. Under the
   MMEY strategy, fleets with more diversified catch structures perform
   better facing climate change.},

Title = {A morphologist, a modeler, and an endocrinologist consider sea turtle
   sex ratios in a changing climate. Some wine was involved},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Because the sex of sea turtles is determined by temperature during
   embryonic development, many populations are vulnerable to increased bias
   in primary sex ratios as global temperatures rise. Higher temperatures
   produce more females, and some populations are already showing years
   with all-female offspring production. But because sea turtles take
   decades to mature and have long adult lifespans, these primary sex ratio
   biases can take years to impact adult sex ratios, and the males from
   cohorts that are produced during cooler years may compensate for the sex
   ratio bias if they can breed more frequently and with multiple females.
   To date, little is known about male sea turtle reproductive behavior,
   making predictions of sex ratio skew impacts highly speculative. We used
   data from southern Florida loggerhead sea turtle nests to parameterize a
   simple population model to explore the effects of an increase in the
   proportion of female hatchlings over time on population trends,
   effective population size (N-e), and quasi-extinction probability. We
   also tested the effects of increasing the frequency of relatively high
   male production years to simulate potential mitigation strategies. While
   heuristic rather than predictive, our results expectedly show a rise in
   nest counts due to the increase in females over time, followed by
   population decline as males become limiting. Population collapse due to
   increased female bias will take many decades to occur, but sex ratio
   skew can have large impacts on N-e, and thus increase the potential for
   inbreeding. An increase in the frequency of male production years, even
   just one additional ``good male year{''} per decade, can help mitigate
   these outcomes if the rate of feminization is not too rapid. Male
   breeding frequency and mating success are critical drivers of the
   results and must be prioritized for research.},

Title = {The grey - green spectrum: A review of coastal protection interventions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {311},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In the face of uncertainties around coastal management and climate
   change, coastal engineering interventions need to be able to adapt to
   changing conditions. Nature-based solutions and other non-traditional,
   integrated interventions are gaining traction. However, system-based
   views are not yet embedded into coastal management strategies. Moreover,
   the differences in coastal interventions, ranging from hard ('grey') to
   nature-based ('green') infrastructure remain understudied. In coastal
   management it is therefore challenging to work with the grey green
   spectrum of interventions with clarity and focus, and to produce results
   that can be evaluated. The objective of this paper was to examine
   whether there is a common understanding of: the characteristics and
   differences between grey and green infrastructure, where interventions
   sit on this spectrum, and the resilience of grey versus green
   infrastructure. We conducted an integrative literature review of the
   grey-green spectrum of coastal infrastructure. We examined 105 coastal
   protection case studies and expanded the double-insurance framework to
   ensure an integrative approach, looking at both external and internal
   factors of resilience. Our review showed that external factors are
   typically used to characterise the grey-green spectrum. However,
   although useful, they do not facilitate a holistic comparison of
   alternative interventions. The additional consideration of internal
   factors (response diversity, multifunctionality, modularity and
   adaptive, participatory governance) bridges this gap. The review showed
   that dikes, reefs, saltmarshes, sand nourishment and dunes span a wider
   segment of the grey-green spectrum than they are generally categorised
   in. Furthermore, resilient solutions for adaptation are unlikely to be
   exclusively engineered or natural, but tend to be a mix of the two at
   different spatial scales (micro, meso, macro and mega). Our review
   therefore suggests that coastal planners benefit from a more diverse
   range of options when they consider the incorporation of grey and green
   interventions in the context of each spatial scale. We propose that
   internal resilience should be accounted for when infrastructure options
   are comparatively evaluated. This consideration brings attention to the
   ways in which the grey-hybrid-green spectrum of infrastructure enhances
   value for people.},

Title = {A Value Sensitive Scenario Planning Method for Adaptation to Uncertain
   Future Sea Level Rise},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS},

Abstract = {Value sensitive design (VSD) aims at creating better technology based on
   social and ethical values. However, VSD has not been applied to
   long-term and uncertain future developments, such as societal planning
   for climate change. This paper describes a new method that combines
   elements from VSD with scenario planning. The method was developed for
   and applied to a case study of adaptation to sea level rise (SLR) in
   southern Sweden in a series of workshops. The participants of the
   workshops found that the method provided a framework for discussing
   long-term planning, enabled identification of essential values,
   challenged established planning practices, helped find creative
   solutions, and served as a reminder that we do not know what will happen
   in the future. Finally, we reflect on the limitations of the method and
   suggest further research on how it can be improved for value sensitive
   design of adaptation measures to manage uncertain future sea level rise.},

Title = {Impacts of rising sea temperature on krill increase risks for predators
   in the Scotia Sea},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Climate change is a threat to marine ecosystems and the services they
   provide, and reducing fishing pressure is one option for mitigating the
   overall consequences for marine biota. We used a minimally realistic
   ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the
   growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations
   of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in
   the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion
   risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in
   the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill
   biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a >= 40\%
   decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25\%
   chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion
   threshold (75\% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some
   predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance
   declined by up to 30\% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50\% chance
   of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at
   currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion,
   and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean
   warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location
   and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also
   differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some
   predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future
   changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always
   map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of
   identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection
   measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for
   spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated
   with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among
   marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future.},

Title = {Assessing drivers of tropical and subtropical marine fish collapses of
   Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {702},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Overfishing is a concerning threat that can lead to the collapse of fish
   stocks. We assessed the combinations of factors, including biological
   traits, types of exploitation and responses to sea temperature and
   salinity changes, that drive species to collapse in the Brazilian
   Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) tropical and subtropical regions. We
   applied a catch-based method of stock classification and a catch time
   series of 61 years from 132 exploited fish species. Species were
   categorized as Collapsed, Overexploited, Fully Exploited or in
   Development, and we used a GAM analysis to understand their
   categorization over time. Furthermore, a Redundancy Analysis was
   developed to assess the species characteristics that best predicted each
   exploitation category. Twelve species were classified as Collapsed, 55
   as Overexploited, 46 as Fully Exploited and 19 as in Development.
   Tropical and subtropical exploited species collapses in Brazil were best
   explained by a complex combination of a negative impact of warmer sea
   temperatures, fishery exploitation and specific life-history traits. A
   synergistic interaction between these factors could bring species to
   collapse. We hypothesize that the exploitation of species with
   vulnerable traits may alter how these species respond to temperature
   and, therefore, lead them to collapse given that intense exploitation
   may affect their ability to respond to temperature increases. Measures
   to mitigate climate change impacts should take into consideration
   incentives to decrease the exploitation of vulnerable species and,
   specifically, consider species with more sensitive biological traits.
   Such measures are also important to minimize the socioeconomic impacts
   on the people that depend on these species. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We have found that plants in natural ecosystems adapt to abiotic stress
   by forming symbiotic associations with Class 2 fungal endophytes.
   Without the endophytes, plants are not stress-tolerant and do not
   survive in the habitats to which they are adapted. Symbiotically
   conferred stress tolerance typically occurs in a habitat-specific manner
   and is based on interactions between environmental factors and both
   plant and fungal genomes. For example, endophytes from geothermal plants
   confer heat tolerance, and endophytes from coastal plants confer salt
   tolerance. We have designated this phenomenon as habitat-adapted
   symbiosis and hypothesize that it is a ubiquitous aspect of plant
   ecology. Class 2 endophytes also increase plant growth and development
   while decreasing water consumption. We present metabolic and gene
   expression data to support a working model for the underlying mechanisms
   of endophyte-conferred benefits to plants. Although endophytes had no
   effect on photosynthetic rate and metabolic efficiency, they
   significantly increased photosynthetic efficiency. Endophytes
   significantly altered the ratio of upregulated to downregulated (UR:DR
   genes) plant genes compared with nonsymbiotic plants. Specific UR:DR
   gene ratios varied with endophyte species as well as habitat of origin.
   Collectively, these observations have allowed us to design a new
   symbiogenic (symbio = symbiosis; genic = gene influence) strategy for
   mitigating impacts of climate change on crop production.},

   Among the several points illustrated, an institutional absence is
   revealed-the postcolonial state. In response to its ineffective
   initiative, villagers express ambivalences about, and attachments to,

Title = {Anxiety disorders, climate change, and the challenges ahead:
   Introduction to the special issue},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {76},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change involves (1) increases in the prevalence of extreme
   weather events (e.g., wildfires, floods, hurricanes), (2) more gradual
   climatic changes (e.g., rising sea levels, desertification), and (3)
   increased risks of pandemics and other widespread disease outbreaks.
   Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or
   maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as
   efforts to reduce one's carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take
   the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but
   incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the
   form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic
   stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events
   or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due
   to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions
   are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1)
   programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby
   take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment
   programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic
   stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and
   community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.},

Abstract = {Coastal inundation causes considerable impacts on communities and
   economies. Sea level rise due to climate change increases the occurrence
   of coastal flood events, creating more challenges to coastal societies.
   Here we intend to draw the understanding of coastal inundation from our
   early studies, and provide a silhouette of our approaches in assessing
   climate change impacts as well as developing risk-based climate
   adaptation. As a result, we impart a distinctive view of the adaption
   towards the integration of asset design, coastal planning and policy
   development, which reflect multiscale approaches crossing individual
   systems to regions and then nation. Having the approaches, we also
   discussed the constraints that would be faced in adaptation
   implementation. In this regard, we initially follow the risk approach by
   illustrating hazards, exposure and vulnerability in relation to coastal
   inundation, and manifest the impact and risk assessment by considering
   an urban environment pertinent to built, natural, and socioeconomic
   systems. We then extend the scope and recommend the general approaches
   in developing adaptation to coastal inundation under climate change
   towards ameliorating overall risks, practically, by the reduction in
   exposure and vulnerability in virtue of the integration of design,
   planning and polices. In more details, a resilience design is
   introduced, to effectively enhance the capacity of built assets to
   resist coastal inundation impact. We then emphasize on the
   cost-effective adaptation for coastal planning, which delineates the
   problem of under-adaptation that leaves some potential benefits
   unrealized or over-adaptation that potentially consumes an excessive
   amount of resources. Finally, we specifically explore the issues in
   planning and policies in mitigating climate change risks, and put
   forward some emerging constraints in adaptation implementation. It
   suggests further requirements of harmonizing while transforming national
   policies into the contents aligned with provincial and local
   governments, communities, and households.},

Abstract = {Climate change severely impacts on the natural and socio-economic
   systems of the Pacific Islands. Samoa, a small insular state of the
   region, is characterized by widespread awareness of climate change
   reflected by its leading international role. This also makes Samoa a
   potentially exemplary reference for the Pacific Islands. Against this
   backdrop, the overall aim of this article is to investigate the notion
   of social vulnerability and measure its dimensions in Samoa through a
   specific index: the Samoa Social Vulnerability Index (SSVI). The SSVI
   may yield better understanding of the characteristics and dynamics of
   social vulnerability, as well as information for fostering adaptation
   strategies in Samoa and in the Pacific Islands. In particular, the
   article first outlines the major vulnerabilities to climate change in
   Samoa and then analyses the composite notion of social vulnerability. On
   this basis, the article methodologically specifies, designs and
   constructs the SSVI. Afterwards, it uses such index for measuring the
   dimensions of social vulnerability in Samoa's districts. Finally, some
   considerations are made concerning the policy relevance of the SSVI and
   its potential regional role.},

Abstract = {In the international climate change negotiations, the Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS) have emerged as a credible group through the
   AOSIS (Alliance of Small Island States) and have called for a global
   temperature rise of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Whatever
   the outcomes of the negotiations, they are exacerbated by climate change
   and a rising sea level. Many share common characteristics of small size,
   high population density, limited land resources, vulnerability to
   natural hazards, threatened biodiversity, high dependence on tourism,
   and limited funds and human resources. The suggestions put forward for a
   research agenda for the SIDS include a comprehensive assessment of the
   SIDS as a group, a focused attention on oceans, increased development on
   renewable energy, inclusion of climate adaptation under natural disaster
   reduction, a strategy of `save some islands rather than not to have any'
   for some SIDS, and large-scale modular mangrove planting for coastal
   protection and adaptation to sea-level rise. These suggestions could
   provide an expanded scope of adaptation for the SIDS. (c) 2010 John

Abstract = {Coastal property is becoming more dynamic as it is subjected to the
   forces of climate change. This is particularly true for low-lying
   coastal areas, where climate-induced change is altering long-standing
   public policies associated with coastal development. In the US, attempts
   to address the new reality of climate change from a programmatic
   standpoint are generally referred to as resiliency planning. This
   article explores the concept of resiliency planning from a
   cost-orientated approach, viewing low-lying coastal property as areas of
   evolving risk. From this viewpoint, we develop a value transfer
   framework proposal that attempts to identify and quantify existing
   coastal asset values and engage in a transfer of the value to less risky
   inland areas that have been identified as economic development priority
   areas. The goal is to provide a risk-based, ``cost center{''} approach
   to land use and related policymaking in risky coastal areas. This
   proposal attempts to highlight an example of a hazard-based policy
   intervention that maximizes opportunities to reduce coastal hazard risk,
   optimizes the social and economic utility of existing coastal investment
   through a transfer of development rights approach that is designed to
   build and enhance coastal resiliency. Future work can improve and build
   upon the principles set forth in the following framework proposal.},

Title = {Vertical Greenery Systems as a Strategy in Urban Heat Island Mitigation},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {226},
Number = {8},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Integrating vegetation into architecture has become widely recognized as
   a multi-beneficial practice in architecture and engineering design to
   combat an array of environmental issues. Urban areas have microclimates
   that are different than the climates of their surrounding rural areas.
   Patterns in these differences over the years have shown that urban
   microclimates tend to be significantly warmer in comparison. This
   phenomenon is now recognized as the urban ``heat island{''} effect.
   While the associated consequences of this urban heating are far
   reaching, excess energy expenditure, air pollution emissions, and
   threats to human health are among the most critical for evaluation. The
   integration of vegetative green space in urban planning, coupled with
   highly reflective materials in place of conventional paved surfaces on
   roads and rooftops have proven to be effective methods of urban heat
   island mitigation. While as separate entities these methods are
   effective, innovative technology has brought forth greening roofs which
   allows vegetation to compensate where other roof-cooling strategies fall
   short. Substantially, vertical greenery systems compensate where
   greening roofs fall short. This paper explores both integrated
   vegetation as an optimal mitigation strategy for urban heat islands and
   vertical plant walls as an optimal design.},

Abstract = {We use a vulnerability framework to examine how residents of
   Pangnirtung, Nunavut, perceive the risks of aquatic activities in the
   context of adaptation to a changing climate. Our findings suggest that
   community members identify climate change as increasing the risk of many
   aquatic activities and have adapted some practices accordingly. However,
   further adaptation to these changing risks is impeded by three main
   barriers: (1) financial constraints, (2) Inuit resistance to adopting
   what some consider Euro-Canadian water safety practices, and (3) issues
   with the design of flotation devices. Participants suggested the
   following practical changes: (1) make personal flotation devices,
   lifejackets, and floater suits available to all residents at local
   stores at a subsidized rate, or provide them free of charge through the
   community; (2) create water safety promotional items that feature
   locally developed messages in both Inuktitut and English; (3) include
   traditional knowledge in water safety campaigns; and (4) use the local
   pool to train residents in water safety. These changes would not only
   help residents adapt to changing risks, but also help incorporate
   climate considerations into policies and programs.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this study, three different environmentally friendly fouling
   mitigation technologies are suggested and are investigated in reverse
   electrodialysis (RED) to develop the most appropriate fouling mitigation
   technology for RED: applying direct current, flowing a solution with
   high salt concentration, and periodically switching river and seawater
   streams in RED. The quantitative level of anion exchange membrane
   fouling mitigation is evaluated in terms of the power density and the
   amount of power generation of RED. Applying a direct current electric
   field with higher voltage than 8 V was not allowed for fouling
   mitigation in the two-cell-pair bench RED stack due to decomposition of
   the redox couple. In comparison of the RED operations with two different
   fouling mitigation methods using firstly 40-min power generation during
   in-operation and 40-min fouling mitigation stage during out-of-operation
   as a cycle for 80 min and secondly 80-min forward power generation and
   80-min backward power generation as two cycles. It was found that, over
   five cycles, the amount of the RED power generation using the former
   fouling mitigation method is 1.7 times higher than RED power generation
   using the latter fouling mitigation method.},

Abstract = {Tidal marshes (including saltmarshes) provide remarkable value for many
   social (cultural, recreational) and environmental (fish production,
   water quality, shoreline protection, carbon sequestration) services.
   However, their extent, condition, and capacity to support these services
   are threatened by human development expansion, invasive species,
   erosion, altered hydrology and connectivity, and climate change. The
   past two decades have seen a shift toward working with managers to
   restore tidal marshes to conserve existing patches or create new
   marshes. The present perspective examines key features of recent tidal
   marsh restoration projects. Although optimism about restoration is
   building, not all marshes are the same; site-specific nuances require
   careful consideration, and thus, standard restoration designs are not
   possible. Restoration projects are effectively experiments, requiring
   clear goals, monitoring and evaluation, and adaptive management
   practices. Restoration is expensive; however, payment schemes for
   ecosystem services derived from restoration offer new ways to fund
   projects and appropriate monitoring and evaluation programs. All
   information generated by restoration needs to be published and easily
   accessible, especially failed attempts, to equip practitioners and
   scientists with actionable knowledge for future efforts. We advocate the
   need for a network of tidal marsh scientists, managers, and
   practitioners to share and disseminate new observations and knowledge.
   Such a network will help augment our capacity to restore tidal marsh,
   but also valuable coastal ecosystems more broadly.},

Title = {The value of monitoring in efficiently and adaptively managing biotoxin
   contamination in marine fisheries},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can produce biotoxins that accumulate in
   seafood species targeted by commercial, recreational, and subsistence
   fisheries and pose an increasing risk to public health as well as fisher
   livelihoods, recreational opportunities, and food security. Designing
   biotoxin monitoring and management programs that protect public health
   with minimal impacts to the fishing communities that underpin coastal
   livelihoods and food systems is critically important, especially in
   regions with worsening HABs due to climate change. This study reviews
   the history of domoic acid monitoring and management in the highly
   lucrative U.S. West Coast Dungeness crab fishery and highlights three
   changes made to these programs that efficiently and adaptively manage
   mounting HAB risk: (1) expanded spatial-temporal frequency of
   monitoring; (2) delineation of clear management zones; and (3)
   authorization of evisceration orders as a strategy to mitigate economic
   impacts. Simulation models grounded in historical data were used to
   measure the value of monitoring information in facilitating efficient
   domoic acid management. Power analysis confirmed that surveys sampling 6
   crabs (the current protocol) have high power to correctly diagnose
   contamination levels and recommend appropriate management actions.
   Across a range of contamination scenarios, increasing the
   spatial-temporal frequency of monitoring allowed management to respond
   more quickly to changing toxin levels and to protect public health with
   the least impact on fishing opportunities. These results highlight the
   powerful yet underutilized role of simulation testing and power analysis
   in designing efficient biotoxin monitoring programs, demonstrating the
   credibility of these programs to stakeholders, and justifying their
   expense to policymakers.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy and sustainable food production are high on the
   international agenda, as is the prospect of expanding activity
   northwards to Arctic waters. In this article, we review core elements of
   the marine governance systems for aquaculture facilities and offshore

   strategic planning, marine spatial planning and licensing systems
   furthers rule of law values such as stability and predictability, making
   investment less risky. The review illustrates how the governance systems
   also facilitate flexibility and adaptability, balancing predictability
   considerations against the need to adapt management to natural and
   economic changes and innovative technologies, or even effective
   multi-use. This article discusses what endeavours have been made to
   strike a balance between predictability and adaptability in these
   sectors in Norway and Scotland. This study of marine management regimes
   in the Arctic and northern parts of the Temperate Northern Atlantic, and
   the values underpinning these regimes, provides lessons for the future

Abstract = {Maritime sectors have always dealt with uncertainties and disruptions.
   The COVID pandemic confronted the cruise industry with profound,
   wide-ranging, and lasting challenges while disrupting normal operations.
   Although the cruise industry contributes to the implementation of the
   United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), resumption and
   sustainable cruising requires the industry to adapt to the challenges
   presented. To this end, the paper suggests adaptive actions for the
   cruise sector to respond to the pandemic and links the actions to the UN
   SDGs to highlight their sustainable contributions. A system thinking
   approach is applied and a literature review is conducted to identify
   suitable adaptive actions. This paper shows the importance of UN SDGs 3,
   4 and, in particular, 17 for sustainable cruising. The results of this
   paper provide support for informed decision-making to increase the
   cruise industry's sustainability. This paper recommends that
   stakeholders: 1- identify drivers and barriers of sustainable cruising,
   2- adapt to changes and embrace the UN SDGs, as they provide a platform
   for realizing sustainability, and 3- use educational programs to improve
   and transfer knowledge on sustainable cruising between academia and
   policymakers.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {418},
Abstract = {Biomonitoring is central to the European Union's Water Framework
   Directive (WFD) and to the French water and aquatic environmental law,
   but most diatom indices do not separate different anthropogenic impacts.
   To address this gap, the effect of water chemistry on diatom ecological
   guilds and life forms was assessed in order to indicate stream
   perturbations. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were built on a
   large-scale data set of 1571 samples from the French monitoring network.
   The relationships between diatom ecological guild and life form metrics
   were investigated by Principal components analysis and the results
   predicted by GAMs. The models characterised eight chemical parameters
   that modified adaptive strategies (ecological guilds) and growth
   morphology (life forms). Total phosphorus, conductivity, nitrate and pH
   are the main influencing factors, followed by temperature, dissolved
   oxygen and organic matter. The findings confirm three groups of diatoms
   with different adaptive strategies: 1 - fast moving species, 2 - species
   growing close to the substrate and 3 - species extending to the surface
   layers of the biofilm. Thirteen diatom metrics displayed a variety of
   responses to different ranges of the eight chemical parameters. These
   metrics could be used to help to identify and quantify which chemical
   alterations are caused by polluted effluents in rivers.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {216},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Introduction: Climate change (CC) has been identified as the biggest
   global health threat of the 21st century. Although health care
   facilities (HCF) play a central role in the care of populations, there
   has been no compre-hensive assessment of the impact of CC on HCF. The
   objective of our study was to highlight the components of HCFs affected
   by CC through a mapping review of the literature.Methods: To meet our
   objective, we first assessed the place of HCFs in relation to CC in the
   scientific literature and in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) reports. Bibliometric data from the PubMed database were
   analyzed between 1979 and 2021 to assess the penetration of keywords on
   CC alone, and in relation to health and HCF in particular. Second, we
   analyzed the changes in HCF keywords in the IPCC reports. Finally, we
   conducted a mapping review in five databases, of the international
   scientific literature published between 1979 and 2019, and identified
   the components of HCF affected by CC using the Ishikawa diagram.
   Results: From the 2000s, the number of publications on CC and HCF
   increased gradually with 137 articles in 2005, and even more sharply
   since 2008 with 358 articles published and 813 in 2021. Even though CC
   is only recently present in the biomedical literature, all climatic
   events (warming and heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, storms, hurricanes
   and cyclones, floods and sea-level rise, and other indirect effects)
   have had an impact on at least one component of HCF. Conclusion: HCFs
   are already impacted, in all their components, by CC. By enhancing our
   understanding of the impacts of CC on HCF, this work could contribute to
   the engagement of health professionals in the imple-mentation of
   mitigation and adaptation actions, thereby limiting the consequences of
   CC on patient care.},

Title = {Protecting the Rhine-Meuse delta against sea level rise: What to do with
   the river's discharge?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) will affect water levels and increase flood risk in
   river deltas. To adapt river deltas to SLR, various strategies can be
   followed. Many urbanised river deltas already have flood protection in
   place. Continuing a protection strategy under an increasing SLR, would
   mean higher embankments along the coast and rivers and possibly closing
   off the river mouths from the sea. However, closing of rivers will
   hamper the river flow. How to adapt river deltas and enabling rivers to
   discharge into the sea is a challenging question. This paper assesses
   impacts of SLR on flood risks in the Rhine-Meuse Delta in the
   Netherlands in case the current protection strategy is continued and
   explores two alternative protection strategies: (1) a closed system with
   pumps and discharge sluices and (2) an open system in which rivers are
   diverted to less densely populated areas. The second alternative results
   in a more flexible river delta, which can accommodate larger SLR. The
   paper shows that a systems approach and using quantitative assessments
   of the implications of strategies is possible. This is needed to further
   assess the adaptation options, so we can anticipate and adapt when
   needed and avoid regret of decisions.},

Title = {Building Community Resilience to Disasters: A Review of Interventions to
   Improve and Measure Public Health Outcomes in the Northeastern United
   States},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change-related natural disasters, including wildfires and
   extreme weather events, such as intense storms, floods, and heatwaves,
   are increasing in frequency and intensity. These events are already
   profoundly affecting human health in the United States and globally,
   challenging the ability of communities to prepare, respond, and recover.
   The purpose of this research was to examine the peer-reviewed literature
   on community resilience initiatives in one of the most densely populated
   and economically important regions, the Northeastern United States, and
   to identify evidence-based interventions and metrics that had been
   field-tested and evaluated. This paper addresses two critical gaps in
   the literature: (1) what strategies or interventions have been
   implemented to build or enhance community resilience against climate
   change-related natural disasters; and (2) what metrics were used to
   measure community resilience as an outcome of those strategies or
   interventions? This review provides a succinct list of effective
   interventions with specific health outcomes. Community or state-level
   health officials can use the results to prioritize public health
   interventions. This review used existing database search tools to
   discover 205 studies related to community resilience and health
   outcomes. Methods set criteria to assess if interventions were able to
   measure and change levels of community resilience to the health impacts
   associated with a changing climate. Criteria included: (a) alignment
   with the United States' National Preparedness Goal for reducing risks to
   human health and for recovering quickly from disasters; (b) derived from
   publicly available data sources; (c) developed for use by communities at
   a local scale; and (d) accessible to modestly resourced municipalities
   and county health agencies. Five (5) peer-reviewed, evidence-based
   studies met all of the selection criteria. Three of these articles
   described intervention frameworks and two reported on the use of
   standardized tools. Health-related outcomes included mental health
   impacts (PTSD/depression), mental stress, emergency preparedness
   knowledge, social capital skills, and emergency planning skills. The
   paper recommends the COAST project, COPEWELL Rubric for self-assessment,
   and Ready CDC intervention as examples of strategies that could be
   adapted by any community engaged in building community resilience.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {35-48},

Abstract = {Renewable technologies have been advocated in Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS) as a risk mitigation measure against oil price volatility.
   This paper applies empirical data in a custom-built stochastic
   simulation model in order to assess the economic impacts of renewable
   technology investments in Fiji's electricity grid. The model extends
   previous applications of portfolio theory to the electricity sector by
   incorporating variability of output from different technologies. The
   results demonstrate that investments in low-cost, low-risk renewable
   technologies, such as geothermal, energy efficiency, biomass and bagasse
   technologies, can be expected to lower both generation costs and
   financial risk for the electricity grid in Fiji. These results are
   driven by the reduction in oil-fired generation that these investments
   entail. The benefits of hydropower and several other ``intermittent{''}
   renewable technologies are more limited in the model, given that they
   require costly investment in backup oil based generating capacity. (C)

   Insights from General Public Opinion Survey in Florida},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},

Abstract = {The Everglades is a unique ecosystem in Florida that offers a variety of
   ecosystem services (ES), including water supply and flood risk
   reduction, water purification, habitats for several endemic species, and
   recreational opportunities. Therefore, the ramifications of climate
   change, an imminent threat to the Everglades ecosystem, are going to
   affect these ecosystem services drastically. The climate-induced changes
   to the ecosystem services are going to affect people's lives and
   livelihoods in the region. Thus, understanding public perception and
   preferences is an important step in addressing the impending risk. In
   this study, we used an online survey to assess residents' perceptions
   about the risk of climate change and their views on mitigating potential
   consequences. We find that people's perceptions and preferences are
   shaped by their level of education, age, participation in outdoor
   recreational activities, and elevation and distance from the shoreline
   of their residential location from the mean sea-level. In general,
   people who are concerned about the flooding risk and people who tend to
   prioritize environmental conservation are more likely to agree with the
   potential impacts of climate change and sea-level rise and more likely
   to support proposed measures for adaptation. We discuss the policy
   implications for developing socially acceptable plans based on the
   findings regarding people's perception and preferences for adaptation in
   this region.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},

Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {501-510},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Changing precipitation patterns including more intense and prolonged dry
   periods have become a growing concern for people living in the Pacific
   Island region. People in the region are particularly sensitive to these
   changes given their resource-based livelihoods and high dependence on
   rainfall for their freshwater needs. Despite this, little attention has
   been given to understanding the implications of climatic changes for
   people and their capacity to manage these changes. This paper assesses
   human vulnerability to climate change (as it relates to fresh water
   resources) in Vusama, an iTaukei village in southwest Viti Levu, Fiji in
   the context of recent social and ecological changes. An analysis of data
   collected using a vulnerability approach that included semi-structured
   interviews, participant observation and analysis of secondary sources
   reveal that climate change together with behavioural changes are
   negatively affecting availability and access to clean freshwater, with
   implications for household economies, food security and human health. In
   particular, prolonged drought and changing seasonal patterns, together
   with people's increasing reliance on a village borehole in lieu of
   family wells have resulted in a freshwater crisis. People are coping by
   using earnings from wage employment and harvesting and selling seafood
   to buy water and vegetables, rationing freshwater and depending on
   extended social networks for fresh produce. Current responses are
   reactive and short-term. Longer-term adaptation strategies are needed
   that consider expected future climate change and broader human
   development goals.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Climate Change is commonly known as global warming and
   associated with sea level rise. Such process is one of the most serious
   challenges facing the human beings in the 21st century. Under the impact
   of these phenomena, extreme climatic phenomena are expected to be more
   frequent and serious, leading to natural disasters especially related to
   water. Flood risk represents a major issue especially for developing
   countries where the economy as well as the adaptation capacity against
   disaster is still poor. As shown in World Bank studies, with more than
   70\% of the population working in agriculture, inhabitants essentially
   concentrate at the coastal plain, Vietnam is one of the countries most
   heavily affected by the consequences of climate change. To get more
   understanding on the impact of this natural phenomenon to Vietnamese
   people, a methodology has been elaborated in order to assess different
   climate scenarios over a large catchment and flood dynamics. The
   simulations are based on a validated deterministic hydrological model
   which is integrating geology, soil, topography, river systems and
   climate variables. The validation of this model is obtained through
   measurements and observations made at different stations within the
   catchment. The actual climate in the period of 1998-2004 is properly
   reproduced by the model which provides a clear view about the flood
   processes. Future climate is obtained from downscaled GCM data that
   provide a scenario for 2094-2100 of hydrological variables. The new
   simulation allows to analyze the changes in the flood dynamics and to
   perform the frequency and the return period analysis. The approach
   allows providing an operational model for integrating the climate change
   within the engineering design activities dedicated to flood protection
   measures and resilience strategies.},

Abstract = {The common narrative in disaster studies positions the field's paradigm
   shift from postevent response to preevent mitigation as a progressive

   valuable contributions to reducing human suffering, these techniques
   continue the biopolitics of disaster management that early critiques of

   disaster management, I show how participatory and mitigation techniques
   were deterritorialized from marginalized experiences of disaster and
   reterritorialized into mitigation policies through the confluence of
   local disaster events and the global emergence of sustainable
   development and resilience theory. Rather than offering new forms of
   empowerment and security from unpredictable change, institutionalized
   disaster mitigation articulates disaster preparedness with
   sustainability's calculative foresight and resilience theory's visions
   of life as an emergent socioecological system to extend logistical
   orderings of life to the everyday socioecological metabolisms that make
   up daily existence. Institutionalized mitigation enacts a new series of
   power relations through an immunitary logic that problematizes
   adaptability as the source of, and solution to, the threat that
   disasters pose to neoliberal order.},

Abstract = {KETTLE, NP., 2012. Exposing compounding uncertainties in sea level rise
   assessments. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(1), 161-173. West Palm
   Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.
   Coastal communities and ecosystems, including those along the Carolina
   coast of the eastern United States, are at risk to permanent or episodic
   inundation, contamination of freshwater supplies, and a host of other
   climate change related environmental hazards due to sea level rise. In
   order to guide development of mitigation and adaptation strategies,
   stakeholders will require information on baseline conditions and
   projections of change. However, the interpretation of impact assessments
   is not always straightforward given the uncertainties in measuring
   relative sea level rise, the challenges in predicting the magnitude of
   change, and the difficulty in acquiring appropriate data and
   methodologies for quantifying impacts. In addition, many sea level rise
   assessments are not at spatial or temporal scales most relevant for
   decision makers. In the context of sea level rise assessments, this
   study presents a model to describe the various sources of compounding
   uncertainty that can compromise evaluations and complicate
   interpretations. Sea level trends and impacts along the Carolina
   coastline a region at risk to significant economic and environmental
   losses are then reviewed as a means of (1) illustrating the compounding
   sources of uncertainty and (2) testing the state of our knowledge and
   identifying information gaps and processing limitations that impede
   understanding adaptation to sea level rise.},

Title = {A New Framework to Assess Relative Ecosystem Vulnerability to Climate
   Change},
Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Climate change poses a growing risk to global biodiversity. To
   prioritize conservation efforts, identification of the species and
   ecosystems most at risk from further changes in climatic conditions is
   critically needed. Although frameworks are available to assess species
   vulnerability to climate change, we still lack an easily implementable,
   ecosystem-level perspective to inform landscape management. Here, we
   introduce a novel, spatially explicit vulnerability framework able to
   generate assessments at the ecosystem scale and apply it to Mozambican
   forest mangroves, which are under growing pressures from climate change.
   Results show that most of these ecosystems are currently highly
   vulnerable to sea level rise, while mangroves in the Zambezia and
   Nampula districts are highly vulnerable to both sea level rise and
   tropical storms. Altogether, we believe the introduced assessment
   framework has clear potential to inform conservation planning and
   management at various spatial scales, and help achieve adaptive
   management in the face of climatic uncertainties.},

Title = {Fouling mitigation strategies for different foulants in membrane
   distillation},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING-PROCESS INTENSIFICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Providing clean water to a rapidly growing population is an issue that
   is currently getting lots of attention to offer a sustainable solution
   for water scarcity. Membrane distillation (MD) is one of the latest
   technologies that provides great potential in water treatment. Even
   though there is a tremendous amount of research done during the past two
   decades on membrane distillation, the long-term use of this process is
   still restricted by membrane fouling. Membrane Fouling can be defined as
   the accumulation of various materials in the pores or surface of the
   membrane that affect permeate's quantity and quality. This review
   highlights the recent observations on various foulants in MD process.
   Moreover, different fouling mechanisms of inorganic fouling, organic
   fouling, biological fouling, and colloidal fouling were investigated for
   better understanding and prevention of membrane fouling. In order to
   achieve a sustainable MD process, various techniques to mitigate fouling
   were discussed comprehensively including pre-treatment processes and
   cleaning methods. The benefits and disadvantages of these approaches
   have been investigated and reviewed in order to provide an overall
   understanding of fouling minimization in membrane distillation process.
   Fouling mitigation strategies have been suggested for different foulants
   in membrane distillation.},

Abstract = {Progressive climate-driven environmental changes are threatening the

   responses vary in relation to hazard exposure is poorly understood. We
   use a systematic review approach to identify a global data set of 301
   reported adaptation responses (remaining, adaptive, and transformative)
   of small-scale fishers to climate change and analyse their spatial
   agreement with estimated geographical location of global coastal hotspot
   areas for specific climate change hazards associated to those responses
   (long-term trends in sea surface temperature, cumulative intensity of
   marine heatwaves, frequency of tropical storms, and intensity of
   associated storm surges). Only 37\% of responses were found in climate
   change hotspots. Despite this, our results evidence that fishers are
   responding more passively in areas with lower exposure levels to abrupt
   climatic events. The relative proportion of adaptive and transformative
   responses increase with climate change hazard exposure.
   Small-scale fishers exhibit more active adaptive and transformative
   responses in areas with higher exposure levels to climate change
   hazards, according to a global systematic review approach of

Abstract = {Coastline maintenance in the Netherlands, formally in place since 1990,
   aims at a sustainable preservation of coastal flood protection. Over 25
   years annual assessments, comparing the actual coastline positions with
   the 1990 reference position of the coastline, have governed the
   execution of sand nourishments following an adaptive management method.
   This method involves yearly assessment of the coastline based on
   measurements, design and adoption of nourishment strategies and measures
   and execution of the nourishments. This management approach has enabled
   learning and introduction of innovations in coastline maintenance. For
   instance, in comparison to the early nineties, nourishments are now
   placed more on the foreshore and the yearly nourishment budget has
   doubled. The most recent innovation in coastline maintenance is the
   `Sand Motor', a nature-based nourishment approach, which concentrates
   the regular nourishments in space and time, given that natural processes
   should redistribute the sediment over the wider coastal system. In
   contrast to regular nourishments, the Sand Motor combines flood
   protection with nature and recreational objectives and is much larger in
   dimensions. Five years after the construction of the Sand Motor we
   investigate its usability in this article. We present the results of
   first Sand Motor evaluation and draw conclusion on the adoption and
   usefulness of it for coastline management from the perspective of the
   adaptive management method used in coastline maintenance. Recent
   evaluation of the monitoring data shows that the large amount of sand
   used for the Sand Motor has a positive impact on coastal protection.
   Bridging between the Sand Motor pilot and daily nourishement practice is
   however not yet achieved.},

Abstract = {Spraying plants with exogenous substances have gained more attention due
   to its potential to reduce the negative impacts of heat and water stress
   in a climate-changing environment. Therefore, the effects of spraying
   kaolin and Ascophyllum nodosum with and without irrigation on leaf gas
   exchange parameters, plant water status, electrolyte leakage, cuticular
   waxes, plant hormones and antioxidant enzymes, proline, malondialdehyde
   (MDA) content and lipid peroxidation of membranes of hazelnut trees were
   studied. Six different treatments with kaolin (K), A. nodosum (An),
   irrigation (I), kaolin with irrigation (Ki), A. nodosum with irrigation
   (Ani) and no irrigation (control) during two consecutive years
   (2016-2017) were applied in a hazelnut orchard of `Grada de Viseu'
   cultivar located in Moimenta da Beira region, Northern Portugal. Results
   showed that K and An were effective for reducing hazelnut heat and
   drought stress by increasing the water relative content (RWC), net CO2
   assimilation (A), water use efficiency (A/g(s)) and reducing the leaf
   mass per area (LMA), electrolyte leakage (EL). Moreover, concentration
   of ABA, MDA, proline and lipid peroxidation of membranes, as well the
   average content of antioxidant enzymes, was lower, suggesting that under
   K and An, plants have a better physiological performance than without
   these two exogenous substances. Nonetheless, these benefits only appear
   to be significant in the second year of the experiment showing that the
   use of both substances to mitigate climate change adverse effects should
   be considered as a long-term strategy.},

Title = {Vulnerability of exploited deep-sea demersal species to ocean warming,
   deoxygenation, and acidification},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Number = {10, SI},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vulnerability of marine species to climate change (including ocean
   acidification, deoxygenation, and associated changes in food supply)
   depends on species' ecological and biological characteristics. Most
   existing assessments focus on coastal species but systematic analysis of
   climate vulnerability for the deep sea is lacking. Here, we combine a
   fuzzy logic expert system with species biogeographical data to assess
   the risks of climate impacts to the population viability of 32 species
   of exploited demersal deep-sea species across the global ocean. Climatic
   hazards are projected to emerge from historical variabilities in all the
   recorded habitats of the studied species by the mid-twenty-first
   century. Species that are both at very high risk of climate impacts and
   highly vulnerable to fishing include Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus
   mawsoni), rose fish (Sebastes norvegicus), roughhead grenadier
   (Macrourus berglax), Baird's slickhead (Alepocephalus bairdii), cusk
   (Brosme brosme), and Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelepis). Most
   exploited deep-sea fishes are likely to be at higher risk of local, or
   even global, extinction than previously assessed because of their high
   vulnerability to both climate change and fishing. Spatially, a high
   concentration of deep-sea species that are climate vulnerable is
   predicted in the northern Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific region.
   Aligning carbon mitigation with improved fisheries management offers
   opportunities for overall risk reduction in the coming decades. Regional
   fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) have an obligation to
   incorporate climate change in their deliberations. In addition, deep-sea
   areas that are not currently managed by RFMOs should be included in
   existing or new international governance institutions or arrangements.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1811-1821},
Abstract = {Natural hazards, due to climate change, are particularly damaging in
   urban areas because of interdependencies of their networks. So, urban
   resilience has to face up to climate risks. The most impacting
   phenomenon is the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The storage capacity
   of heat is depending on shapes of buildings, public spaces, spatial
   organization, transport or even industrial activities. So, adaptive
   strategies for improving urban climate could be possible in different
   ways. In the framework of the French project Resilis, this study
   characterises urban vulnerability and resilience in terms of energy
   needs of buildings and outside urban comfort according to the IPCC
   carbon dioxide emission scenarios B2 and A2 for the period 2050-2100 for
   10 French cities. The evolutions of four climate indicators in terms of
   heating and cooling needs and number of hours when the temperature is
   above 28 degrees C are then obtained for each city to analyse climate
   risks and their impacts in urban environment.},

Title = {Adapting to Climate Change in the Upper Mississippi River Basin:
   Exploring Stakeholder Perspectives on River System Management and Flood
   Risk Reduction},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the Midwestern United States (US), river flooding is a climate
   change-related hazard that poses a significant threat to health,
   well-being and economic stability. The 2019 Midwest floods led to major
   flooding at every monitoring site along the Mississippi River, set
   record water levels at 42 sites, and resulted in an estimated \$6.2
   billion in infrastructure damage and recovery costs. Although the risks
   associated with increasing flooding in the Midwestern US have been well
   recognized, less is known about the adaptation challenges and
   opportunities in the region, particularly in the Upper Mississippi River
   Basin. This exploratory study examined stakeholder perspectives on river
   system management, flood risk reduction, and adaptation planning in the
   Upper Mississippi River Basin. We conducted in-depth interviews with
   flood management stakeholders between August and October 2019. Interview
   data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Five themes emerged from the
   interviews: (1) River flooding in the Midwestern US is a different
   experience than US coastal flooding; (2) River flooding in the
   Midwestern US is a regional experience that requires a regional
   response; (3) Local actors face constrained resources for flood risk
   protection and recovery; (4) Differentiated responsibility across levels
   of governments makes recovery and response difficult to navigate; and
   (5) Competing stakeholder goals challenge cooperative flood hazard
   management. Overall, these results suggest that locally focused
   adaptation efforts, while perhaps appropriate for coastal communities or
   more urban contexts, are suboptimal strategies for communities in the
   flood-prone river basins of the Midwestern US. Instead, structures and
   support for regional collaboration should be considered and pursued.},

Abstract = {Renewable obligation is a crucial policy to tackle the twin challenges

   This paper analyses implications of Renewable Obligation and climate
   change mitigation policy in regional electricity generation mix and
   regional renewable electricity trade in the UK low carbon scenarios. The
   newly developed 2 region UK MARKAL model has been used for the analysis.
   UK is divided into two regions: Scotland and rest of the UK Spatial
   off-shore wind resource data has been used for the modeling by
   quantifying the UK continental off-shore wind resources into several
   zones. Analysis shows that renewable electricity flow between Scotland
   and rest of the UK is heavily influenced by renewable obligations in the
   short-and medium-term while climate change policy influence in the

Abstract = {Future climate projections of Global Climate Models (GCMs) under
   different emission scenarios are usually used for developing climate
   change mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, the existing GCMs
   have only limited ability to simulate the complex and local climate
   features, such as precipitation. Furthermore, the outputs provided by
   GCMs are too coarse to be useful in hydrologic impact assessment models,
   as these models require information at much finer scales. Therefore,
   downscaling of GCM outputs is usually employed to provide
   fine-resolution information required for impact models. Among the
   downscaling techniques based on statistical principles, multiple
   regression and weather generator are considered to be more popular, as
   they are computationally less demanding than the other downscaling
   techniques. In the present study, the performances of a multiple
   regression model (called SDSM) and a weather generator (called LARS-WG)
   are evaluated in terms of their ability to simulate the frequency of
   extreme precipitation events of current climate and downscaling of
   future extreme events. Areal average daily precipitation data of the
   Clutha watershed located in South Island, New Zealand, are used as
   baseline data in the analysis. Precipitation frequency analysis is
   performed by fitting the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to
   the observed, the SDSM simulated/downscaled, and the LARS-WG
   simulated/downscaled annual maximum (AM) series. The computations are
   performed for five return periods: 10-, 20-, 40-, 50- and 100-year. The
   present results illustrate that both models have similar and good
   ability to simulate the extreme precipitation events and, thus, can be
   adopted with confidence for climate change impact studies of this
   nature.},

Abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a proliferation of research into the human
   dimensions of climate change in the Arctic. Much of this work has
   examined impacts on subsistence hunting, fishing, and trapping among
   Canadian Inuit communities. This scholarship has developed a baseline
   understanding of vulnerability and adaptation, drawing upon interviews
   with community members and stakeholders to identify and characterize
   climatic risks and adaptive strategies. To further advance this baseline
   understanding, new methodologies are needed to complement existing
   research if we are to capture the dynamic nature of how climate change
   is experienced and responded to, and fully engage communities as equal
   partners. Longitudinal studies, community-based monitoring, and targeted
   adaptation research offer significant promise to advance understanding.
   These methodologies provide a strong basis for developing meaningful
   partnerships with communities, the co-production of knowledge, and
   empowerment for adaptation: essential components of community-based
   participatory research.},

Abstract = {The communication channels influence the effectiveness of climate change
   information dissemination in achieving the goals. Previous researches
   measured the efficacy of several channels such as people, television,
   radio, web, documentary film, animation, and newspaper. However, none of
   them identified to find the appropriate channels Finding the most
   effective channels is required since there is a limited budget to apply
   all channels. Accordingly, this paper aims to select proper
   communication channels for disseminating information about climate
   change for the coastal and small islands' communities in Indonesia. Then
   we surveyed by spreading questioners. Furthermore, we applied
   non-parametric tests Kolmogorov-Smimov (K - S) for determining the kind
   of distribution of the data. The analysis showed that the distribution
   of data is not normal. Therefore we applied a non-parametric statistical
   test, Friedman test for determining the ranking of the channels. This
   research provides a recommendation in selecting appropriate
   communication channels to deliver climate change information for the
   coastal and small islands' communities in Indonesia.},

Abstract = {Human activities in coastal lagoons over several decades have had a
   significant impact on their ecology and the valuable ecosystem services
   they provide. Although there are several management approaches to
   mitigate the problem, they are unable to link human needs and activities
   with changes in the state of the environment. This research provides
   this link via assessment of eleven lagoons in Ghana with a
   socio-ecological framework (Drivers (D), Activities (A), Pressure (P),
   State (S), Impact (I) on welfare (W), and Response (R) as a Measure (M);
   DAPSI(W)R(M)). Data were systematically obtained from relevant
   publications, previously conducted research, and national reports on the
   subject and were analyzed using this socio-ecological framework. Results
   show that basic biological and physiological needs such as food and
   shelter, social status and dominance, financial self-reliance, and
   self-actualization are the drivers of fishing, farming, settlements,
   salt mining, mangrove harvesting, industries, among others. These
   activities have contributed to pressures of selective extraction of fish
   and mangroves species, the introduction of heavy metals, organic
   materials, and smothering of substrates, consequently altering the
   environment by decreasing the oxygen rate and increasing the biochemical
   oxygen demand, organic matter, nutrients and pathogens, and reduction in
   lagoon areas and biodiversity. Thus, ultimately impacting human welfare,
   such as loss of revenue, employment, and seafood provision. Management
   options, including addressing the building and fuelwood material
   sources, afforestation and community ownership of lagoons, the
   prohibition of construction activities, and research-led management that
   can support decision-makers to improve the sustainability of these
   ecosystems, are highlighted. The findings have global implications for
   guiding local planners and state regulators in the applications of such
   integrated environmental management.},
