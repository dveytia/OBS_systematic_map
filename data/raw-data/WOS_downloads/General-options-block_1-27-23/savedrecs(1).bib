Abstract = {In this work, a risk-based assessment method and benefit-cost analysis
   to support policy decisions for adapting Australian coastal residential
   buildings to future coastal inundation hazard is presented. Future
   coastal inundation is mainly influenced by storm surge and rising sea
   level. The sea level rises projected by the A1FI, A1B and B1 emissions
   scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are
   considered. The effects of economic and population growth are accounted
   for by three urban development scenarios: (a) business as usual, (b)
   urban consolidation and (c) regional development. The adaptation policy
   actions investigated include a `protect' stance (involving the
   construction of seawalls), an `accommodate' stance that mandates raising
   house floors to a certain height (e.g. at heights of 100-year events)
   and an `avoid' stance that limits new developments in hazardous areas.
   Policy stances classified as reactive (i.e. action taken after damage
   being incurred) and anticipatory (i.e. action taken anticipating what
   will happen) are developed for asset investment choices. In general,
   adaptation costs are an order of magnitude lower than benefits gained
   from avoided damages. The results highlight that adaptation action for
   coastal inundation has a no-regrets character and provides a strong case
   for reform to ensure that Australia-wide adaptation opportunities are
   realised.},

Abstract = {The vulnerability of cane and sucrose production to climate change and
   three adaptation options that could be used in Mauritius (20.25degreesS,
   57.5degreesE) were assessed using the Sugarcane module of the
   Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator (APSIM-Sugarcane). Long-term
   observed climate data for one location, identified as being
   representative of the island's productivity, were used to generate the
   baseline yields that were close to the 1954 to 1996 recorded average.
   Climate change scenarios under a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   level were generated using long-term observed data either with outputs
   from General Circulation Models (increases in temperature with
   differences in rainfall and radiation patterns), or with nominal
   increments of 2degreesC and 4degreesC rise in temperature with 10\% and
   20\% increase or decrease in rainfall. The direct effects of CO2
   fertilisation on the physiology of the crop were not accounted for.
   Under all scenarios, the model simulated a reduction in productivity
   that was attributed to lower water use efficiencies and higher
   respiratory demands. Irrigation was the best adaptation option evaluated
   as opposed to a change in cultivar or harvest date.},

Title = {Community awareness towards coastal hazard and adaptation strategies in
   Pahang coast of Malaysia},

Abstract = {The National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia reported that by
   2050, the east coast of the country will suffer increasing substantial
   rainfall, sea-level rise, and recurrent flooding. The effects of coastal
   threats, vulnerability, and adaptation measures are increasingly
   becoming more critical for coastal communities than before. Hence, this
   study aims to measure the levels of community awareness and adaptation
   strategies to coastal hazards and to analyze the differences of
   awareness on the basis of socioeconomic factors. The research is based
   on a household survey (n = 498), which is randomly conducted in 11
   locations on the Pahang coast. Findings indicate that more than half of
   household heads have high levels of awareness regarding coastal hazard
   impacts, such as human casualties; losses of mangroves, coastal forests,
   aquatic, wildlife, and livestock resources; and damage to residential
   properties, coastal infrastructures, agriculture, and economic
   activities. An independent sample T-test and one-way ANOVA demonstrate
   household heads who are elderly (x = 2.57, p < 0.01); experienced (x =
   2.48, p < 0.01); educated (x = 2.65, p < 0.01); healthy (x = 2.42, p <
   0.01); and with an improved socioeconomic status (x = 2.42, p < 0.05)
   having high levels of awareness. This study suggests that education and
   awareness-raising, including capacity building, play essential roles in
   the further understanding and decision making of coastal hazards and
   adaptation strategies. Moreover, the principal component analysis model
   identifies that structural and non-structural measures and
   community-based adaptation measures are essential to protect the coast.
   The study can contribute to the knowledge of community awareness and
   adaptation to coastal hazard literature that can be implemented on a
   global scale.},

Abstract = {Cattle ranchers and dairy farmers operating throughout many tropical
   regions are experiencing major challenges associated with climate change
   such as higher incidence of heat stress and drought. These effects can
   result in reduced productivity of rangeland, shortage of nutritional
   feed, increased heat stress on animals, and high energy costs for
   cooling. High temperatures and resultant heat stress reduce animal
   productivity and increase the proliferation and survival of parasites
   and disease pathogens. Warming reduces the ability of dairy cattle to
   produce milk and gain weight and can also lower conception rates. This
   paper reviews research from the Caribbean on heat tolerant traits in
   bovine and presents evidence that introducing a ``slick hair{''} gene
   into Holstein cows by crossbreeding with Senepols may increase
   thermo-tolerance and productivity. As in other parts of the tropics,
   principal cattle breeds in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have
   been largely introduced from temperate regions. Research indicates these
   animals may be poorly adapted to rising temperatures, leaving them
   increasingly vulnerable to chronic heat stress and reduced productivity.
   Adaptive practices have been developed in breeding and pasture
   management programs including selection for more heat-resistant
   genotypes, silvopasturing and crop diversification in forage production,
   and optimizing facilities and practices to reduce heat stress. Given the
   nature of climate vulnerability, an integrated approach to adaptation
   will likely have the greatest success in reducing future risk for
   producers.},

Abstract = {Among various carbon capture and storage technologies to mitigate global
   warming and ocean acidification due to greenhouse gases, ocean
   geological storage is considered the most feasible for Korea due to
   insufficient inland space to store CO2. However, the risk of
   CO(2)leakage and the behavior and environmental effects of the leaked
   CO(2)need to be assessed for its successful implementation. Therefore,
   the behavior of CO(2)bubbles/droplets dissolving into the surrounding
   seawater and the diffusion of dissolved CO(2)by ocean flows should be
   accurately predicted. However, finding corresponding research has been
   difficult in Korea. Herein, the behavior and convection-diffusion of
   CO(2)that was assumed to have leaked from the seafloor near the
   southeastern coast of Korea were numerically predicted using a
   multi-scale ocean model for the first time. In the simulation region,
   one of the pilot projects of CO(2)ocean geological storage had started
   but has been temporarily halted. In the ocean model, hydrostatic
   approximation and the Eulerian-Lagrangian two-phase model were applied
   for meso- and small-scale regions, respectively. Parameters for the
   simulations were the leakage rate and the initial diameter of CO2.
   Results revealed that all leaked and rising CO(2)bubbles were dissolved
   into the seawater before reaching the free surface; further, the change
   in the partial pressure of CO(2)did not exceed 500 ppm during 30 days of
   leakage for all cases.},

   within sectors dominated by engineering, such as water and coastal

   has an important part to play in climate adaptation, its effectiveness
   relies on it being part of a broader strategy that acknowledges
   uncertainty and addresses the underlying drivers of people's current and

Title = {Characterizing Sockeye Salmon Smolt Interactions with a Hydrokinetic

Abstract = {The development of hydrokinetic turbines has been motivated by the
   desire to reduce fossil fuel reliance, energy production costs, and
   greenhouse gas emissions. Detailed information about fish interactions
   with hydrokinetic turbines is limited; therefore, this study sought to
   characterize the interactions between a turbine (RivGen; Ocean Renewable
   Power Company) and Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from one of the
   most productive populations in the world-that in the Kvichak River,
   Alaska. By viewing real-time video imagery, our objectives were to
   quantify the number of Sockeye Salmon smolts that interacted with the
   turbine and to assess the behaviors/outcomes of these interactions
   during the species' smolt out-migration. From May 21 to June 10, 2021, a
   total of 2,374 Sockeye Salmon smolts passed through the field of view of
   cameras placed immediately downstream of the hydrokinetic turbine. The
   majority of these observed events occurred over a short (5-d) time
   period from late May to early June during periods of darkness (0000-0400
   hours). Fish were observed passing through the hydrokinetic turbine in
   both normal and disoriented manners, with the rotational status/speed of
   the hydrokinetic turbine appearing to influence passage behavior. Blade
   strikes on fish were also observed, all of which occurred when the
   turbine was rotating at high ``production{''} speeds. After temporally
   and spatially extrapolating the observed fish interactions to account
   for our subsampling, the results suggest that when monitoring was
   conducted, the hydrokinetic turbine interacted with approximately
   200,000 Sockeye Salmon smolts during this species' smolt out-migration
   period. This study adds to the sparse knowledge base on fish
   interactions with emerging riverine hydrokinetic devices and may inform
   strategies to mitigate the impacts of developing energy projects on
   socially and culturally important fisheries.},

Abstract = {Fisheries are critically important for nutrition, food security,
   livelihoods, and culture of hundreds of millions of people globally. As
   climate impacts on ocean ecosystems increase, policy-makers are asking
   critical questions about how to implement reforms at local and national
   levels to reach goals around improving performance of management
   systems, sustainability, equity, and resilience to climate change. These
   goals can be achieved by enhancing the structure, function, and
   biodiversity of marine ecosystems as climate change proceeds, together
   with adaptive, sustainable management. However, resource, technical, and
   governance capacities vary widely across management systems. These
   capacities will determine, in part, the best policy approaches to build
   resilience and overcome systemic challenges to equity and sustainability
   to stressors such as climate change. To illuminate how fisheries
   resilience can be improved within the constraints imposed by these
   capacity limits, we present case studies from Myanmar, Belize, Peru, and
   Iceland, which offer a spectrum of capacity conditions to explore
   social-ecological resilience challenges and solutions. Using a set of
   nine social-ecological resilience criteria, we examine each system's
   attributes that may confer or undermine resilience and explore
   interactions between them. We use this assessment to identify policy
   approaches that can help build resilience in each particular context.},

   order to maintain an acceptable risk of flooding suitable adaptation
   strategies must be defined and implemented. Optimum solutions demand

Title = {The global methane budget 2000-2012},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA},

Abstract = {The global methane (CH4) budget is becoming an increasingly important
   component for managing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change.
   This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger
   warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still
   unexplained changes of atmospheric CH4 over the past decade. Emissions
   and concentrations of CH4 are continuing to increase, making CH4 the
   second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide.
   Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large
   variety of diffusive CH4 sources that overlap geographically, and from
   the destruction of CH4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To
   address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of
   multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon
   Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and
   producing regular (similar to biennial) updates of the global methane
   budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists,
   biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who
   study anthropogenic emissions. Following Kirschke et al. (2013), we
   propose here the first version of a living review paper that integrates
   results of top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within
   an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models,
   inventories and data-driven approaches (including process-based models
   for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, and
   inventories for anthropogenic emissions, data-driven extrapolations).
   For the 2003-2012 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by
   top-down inversions at 558 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 540-568. About 60\% of
   global emissions are anthropogenic (range 50-65 \%). Since 2010, the
   bottom-up global emission inventories have been closer to methane
   emissions in the most carbon-intensive Representative Concentrations
   Pathway (RCP8.5) and higher than all other RCP scenarios. Bottom-up
   approaches suggest larger global emissions (736 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range
   596-884) mostly because of larger natural emissions from individual
   sources such as inland waters, natural wetlands and geological sources.
   Considering the atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget, it is
   likely that some of the individual emissions reported by the bottom-up
   approaches are overestimated, leading to too large global emissions.
   Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of
   tropical emissions (similar to 64\% of the global budget, <30 degrees N)
   as compared to mid (similar to 32 \%, 30-60 degrees N) and high northern
   latitudes (similar to 4 \%, 60-90 degrees N). Top-down inversions
   consistently infer lower emissions in China (similar to 58 TgCH(4)
   yr(-1), range 51-72, -14 \%) and higher emissions in Africa (86 TgCH(4)
   yr(-1), range 73-108, + 19 \%) than bottom-up values used as prior
   estimates. Overall, uncertainties for anthropogenic emissions appear
   smaller than those from natural sources, and the uncertainties on source
   categories appear larger for top-down inversions than for bottom-up
   inventories and models.
   The most important source of uncertainty on the methane budget is
   attributable to emissions from wetland and other inland waters. We show
   that the wetland extent could contribute 30-40\% on the estimated range
   for wetland emissions. Other priorities for improving the methane budget
   include the following: (i) the development of process-based models for
   inland-water emissions, (ii) the intensification of methane observations
   at local scale (flux measurements) to constrain bottom-up land surface
   models, and at regional scale (surface networks and satellites) to
   constrain top-down inversions, (iii) improvements in the estimation of
   atmospheric loss by OH, and (iv) improvements of the transport models
   integrated in top-down inversions. The data presented here can be
   downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center
   (http://doi.org/10.3334/CDIAC/GLOBAL\_METHANE\_BUDGET\_2016\_V1.1) and

Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) are among the countries in the
   world that are most vulnerable to climate change and required to adapt
   to its impacts. Yet, there is little information in the academic
   literature about how SIDS are adapting to climate change, across
   multiple countries and geographic regions. This paper helps to fill this
   gap. Using a sample of 16 countries across the Atlantic, Indian Ocean
   and South China Sea, Caribbean and Pacific regions, this study has two
   main aims, to identify (1) national-level adaptation trends across
   climate, climate-induced and non-climate-induced vulnerabilities,
   sectors and actors, as reported in National Communications (NCs) to the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and (2)
   typologies of national-level adaptation actions in SIDS. It identifies,
   codes and assesses 977 adaptation actions. These actions were reported
   as addressing 47 climate and climate-induced vulnerabilities and 50
   non-climate-induced vulnerabilities and were undertaken in 37 sectors by
   34 actors. The paper proposes five typologies of adaptation actions for
   SIDS, based on actions reported by SIDS. It specifically explores the
   implications of its findings for global adaptation strategies. As this
   work establishes a baseline of adaptation action in SIDS, it can assist
   national governments to gauge their adaptation progress, identify gaps
   in their adaptation effort and, thereafter, develop appropriate
   strategies for filling the gaps. It can also assist donors, whether
   bilateral or multilateral, to make more `climate-smart' investment
   decisions by being able to identify the adaptation needs that are not
   being met in SIDS.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2012},
Number = {2273},
Pages = {54-61},
Abstract = {Although the causes of the sea level rise (SLR) are hotly debated,
   almost no disagreement exists that sea levels will continue to rise. The
   SLR is likely to have significant impacts on coastal transportation
   infrastructure. Adaptations in response to the SLR are in urgent need.
   Facing various adaptation strategies, decision makers need information
   on the impacts of different SLR scenarios as well as the economic
   trade-offs of various adaptation strategies. This research attempts to
   quantify the economic impacts of the SLR as well as the costs and
   benefits of adaptation strategies by using cost-benefit analysis at the
   local level. Hillsborough County, Florida, is used as a case study, and
   two projected scenarios for the SLR are applied to it. Light detection
   and ranging data, parcel land use data, and transportation network data
   for the county are employed to estimate the impacts of the two
   scenarios. Three adaptation strategies are suggested to the proposed SLR
   scenarios. Then cost-benefit analysis is conducted for each strategy
   under the two scenarios that consider the impacts of both direct
   inundation costs and indirect travel time costs. On the basis of the
   present values of the net benefits in the proposed strategies, managed
   retreat with critical infrastructure protection is the best adaptation
   strategy for the SLR in the long run and the length of shoreline
   protection is the most sensitive to the net benefits.},

Abstract = {Jakabaring and its surrounding which is part of Palembang are also
   experienced a high level exposure to hazard of inundation, where the
   area is heavily affected by tides which are mostly swamps, consisting of
   reclamation and protection swamps that are vulnerable to the effects of
   climate change. This study aims to determine the level of risk due to
   inundation hazards that occur in current conditions and projected
   conditions through risk assessment with spatial approaches and
   adaptation strategies needed, The vulnerability parameters that used are
   exposure (topography, land use, infrastructure), adaptation capacity
   (drainage), sensitivity (population density, education level, age,
   gender and poverty). In the baseline condition, Jakabaring and its
   surrounding areas is on moderate level of risk. Meanwhile in the
   projection condition (2030), Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on
   high level of risk. The adaptation strategies due to climate change
   impact that can be carried out are river normalization, drainage
   normalization, infiltration measure, pumping, green open space,
   canalization, bio-pore, water retention ponds, multiplying gardens in
   residential area, roads enhancement, pavement enhancement, polders along
   rivers, and supervision of swamp regulations.},

Title = {A Review of Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty Applications Using
   Green Infrastructure for Flood Management},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) approaches are well-suited
   for making decisions about infrastructure to manage flooding exacerbated
   by climate change. One important system for climate resilience and flood
   management is green infrastructure, which refers to a network of natural
   and semi-engineered areas that provides ecosystem functions. Green
   infrastructure is often characterized as a low-regret strategy with
   multiple co-benefits under uncertainty. These attributes enable green
   infrastructure to be an important adaptation strategy under DMDU
   frameworks for flood management. However, DMDU analyses that include
   green infrastructure are still relatively limited, perhaps due to
   computational or modeling complexity and other barriers. This paper
   identifies and reviews publications in the flood management literature
   that use DMDU frameworks and refer to green infrastructure adaptation
   strategies, in order to identify trends and inform future research. The
   reviewed publications are categorized according to a variety of
   performance metrics, climate change scenarios, DMDU metrics, and
   hydrologic modeling techniques, and represent several adaptation
   strategies applied to case studies on five continents using a range of
   data sources and assumptions. This paper highlights a number of
   solutions that can be employed to facilitate additional research at the
   intersection of these fields. Primary among these is the transparent

Title = {Carbon implications of current and future effects of drought, fire and

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {355},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {4-14},

Abstract = {Climate change has already begun to impact the structure and function of
   forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest by altering the frequency,
   intensity, and duration of droughts and heat stress, with implications
   for widespread environmental and socio-economic change. A major
   realization is that accumulated physiological stress can ultimately lead
   to tree mortality and changes in species distributions, particularly in
   areas away from maritime influences. To ameliorate the effects of
   drought, insect outbreaks, and reduce the risk of crown fires, various
   strategies are being tested. To make some of these strategies
   economical, biomass is proposed as an alternative energy source. At the
   same time that an increase in harvesting is being considered, there is a
   desire to increase carbon sequestration by forests to offset, at least
   in part, greenhouse gas emissions. Assessments are needed to determine
   current and future impacts of climate change, and to evaluate management
   options while considering carbon storage benefits and sustainability of
   ecosystem structure and function. Here we provide an overview of
   research results from the Pacific Northwest region where forests
   dominate the landscape and contain among the highest biomass on earth.
   In this review, we present findings that challenge common assumptions,
   and suggest a way to predict outcomes of changes in climate and land
   management in the future. The approach includes the use of
   observation-driven land system models that integrate the extent that
   forests are vulnerable to climate change, management practices, and
   economic considerations. It also requires increased emphasis on in situ
   and remotely sensed observations and experiments to initialize and test
   the model, and to track trends in forest condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Perception on coastal erosion: An assessment of how national level
   coastal resilience strategies promote indigenous knowledge and affect
   local level adaptation in Ghanaian communities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},

Abstract = {Coastal resilience strategies are vital for managing the impacts of
   climatic shocks and stresses that bedevils coastal zones globally.
   Coastal strategies that reflect indigenous knowledge and practices as
   well as local adaptation efforts are productive in promoting resilience
   to coastal erosion at the local level. However, there has been less
   common research in conventional literature on how national level
   strategies impact adaptation mea-sures by local governance institutions
   and coastal dwellers in addressing coastal erosion. Using an explorative
   qualitative case study of selected coastal communities in Ghana, the
   paper contributes to this gap by assessing how national level strategies
   impact adaptation to coastal erosion at the local level. It also
   examines the insti-tutional and community perception of coastal erosion,
   its causes and impacts. Findings indicate that all the coastal dwellers
   in the study communities are aware of coastal erosion with most of the
   community interviewees attributing the phenomenon to sea-level rise as
   the main driver of coastal erosion. Also, interviews with local
   government authorities and state agencies found that the national level
   coastal erosion adaptation strategies to a large extent do not promote
   local innovation in addressing climatic shocks and stresses of coastal
   communities. The paper contributes to contemporary debates in indigenous
   knowledge in climate change mitigation and adaptation by multilevel
   governance towards coastal resilience by recommending a collaborative
   effort between coastal communities and the District Assemblies in
   promoting indigenous knowledge in climate change adap-tation and the
   preparation of coastal management plans that incorporates indigenous
   knowledge in adaptation to coastal erosion.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the response to climate change and sea-level rise requires a
   link from climate change science to the resulting impacts and their
   policy implications. This paper explores the impacts of sea-level rise,
   particularly increased coastal flooding due to storm surges. In
   particular, it asks the simple question ``how,much will projected global
   sea-level rise exacerbate coastal flood problems, if ignored?{''} This
   is an important question to the intergovernmental process considering
   climate change. Further many countries presently ignore sea-level rise
   in long-term coastal planning, even though global sea levels are
   presently slowly rising.
   Using the model of Nicholls et al. {[}Global Environmental Change 9
   (1999) S69], the analysis. considers the flood impacts of sea-level rise
   on an ``IS92a world{''} based on a consistent set of scenarios of
   global-mean sea-level rise, subsidence (where appropriate), coastal
   population change (usually increase), and flood defence standards
   (derived from GDP/capita). Two of the protection scenarios consider the
   possible upgrade of flood defences, but no allowance for global-mean
   sea-level rise is allowed to ensure consistency with the question being
   investigated. This model has been validated against national- and
   regional-scale assessments indicating that the relative results are
   reasonable, and the absolute results are of the right order of
   magnitude.
   The model estimates that 10 million people experienced flooding annually
   in 1990. It also predicts that the incidence of flooding will change
   without sea-level rise due to changes to the other three factors. Taking
   the full range of scenarios considered by 2100 the number of people
   flooded could be from 0.4 to 39 million/year. All the sea-level rise
   scenarios would cause an increase in flooding during the 21st century if
   measures to adapt to sea-level rise are not taken. However, there are
   significant uncertainties and the number of people who are estimated to
   experience flooding in 2100 is 16-388 million for the mid (55-cm)
   global-mean sea-level rise scenarios, and up to 510 million people/year
   for the high (96-cm) scenario. These results suggest that sea-level rise
   could be a significant problem if it is ignored, and hence it needs to
   be considered within the policy process considering climate change in
   terms of mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation
   (improved coastal management and planning) needs. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Recent intensification of urban heat islands (UHIs) poses a great threat
   to public health, promoting studies on UHI mitigation strategies.
   However, the question about the transferability of a mitigation method
   from a specific city to another remains largely unanswered. This study
   compares common UHI mitigation strategies (including green roofs, cool
   roofs, and changing urban building structure) for two Chinese megacities
   suffered from summer heat stress: Xi'an with a semi-humid climate and
   Wuhan with a humid climate, through the use of the
   urbanized-high-resolution land data assimilation system (u-HRLDAS)
   modeling tool and remote-sensing data. The results reveal that (1) all
   UHI mitigation strategies work more efficiently for Xi'an than that for
   Wuhan, particularly for the strategy of modifying urban fraction and
   associated green roof fraction; (2) the difference in cooling efficacy
   between the two cities is insignificant during relatively cool periods.
   Under hot weather conditions, the best choice of UHI mitigation strategy
   depends on urban land use categories in Xi'an; and (3) the differences
   in UHI mitigation efficacy are likely caused by the differing regional
   climate. This study highlights the need to better understand the
   transferability of UHI mitigation strategies in different climate zones.},

Abstract = {In the face of global environmental change, decision-makers need
   effective environmental assessments to shape policies and plans aiming
   at sustainable human development. In this paper, we propose a new
   approach to address the needs of Strategic Environmental Assessment. We
   develop a Limits-Oriented Adaptive framework that is useful not only to
   recognize and address existing SEA problems (its limits), but also to
   incorporate elements of social and institutional uncertainty. This
   framework conceptualizes the need to first identify existing SEA
   limitations (e.g. procedural, legislative) through learning loops, and
   then to address them with incremental or transformative change through
   adaptive cycles. The first part of this paper presents existing
   frameworks of adaptive policy-making, adaptive management and loops of
   learning that can contribute shaping better environmental assessments.
   In the second part, we present our framework and we illustrate how the
   contributions from different disciplines relate to the procedural and
   technical sides of Strategic Environmental Assessment. Last, we present
   the results of the experimental application of our method in an
   Australian and an Italian case study. We then discuss our findings,
   outlining how SEA can learn from adaptive management to overcome its
   limitations and to embrace incremental and transformational change. We
   fie these lessons to the needs of different groups of SEA professionals,
   developers, legislators, and the broad public.},

Abstract = {Freshwater-related risks of climate change increase significantly with
   increasing global temperatures. Globally, the negative impacts of future
   climate change on freshwater systems are expected to outweigh the
   benefits, and agriculture and irrigation, as the largest consumers of
   water globally, are most at risk. This book analyses the potential
   impacts of climate change on water for agriculture, and the adaptation
   strategies in water management to deal with these impacts, drawing on
   global assessments and regional studies.
   This chapter introduces the book, sets the scene for research on climate
   change in agricultural water management, and synthesizes the issues,
   methodologies and findings in the chapters to follow. Chapters 2 and 3
   provide an overview of global assessment of climate change impacts and
   water requirement for future agriculture. Chapters 4-7 provide analyses
   of crop water requirements in four case studies in developing countries.
   Chapters 8 and 9 are studies of irrigation management under sea-level
   rise in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. Chapters 10-12 discuss examples of
   adaptation alternatives such as water-saving techniques and groundwater
   exploitation, and related policy settings. The last chapter links the
   dominant approach of uncertainty presented in the climate change
   discourse with policy discussions on climate adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Urban overheating has become a growing concern in the Northern Territory
   of Australia, where residents are suffering from excessive heat and
   frequent heatwaves. The characteristics of the local climate of Alice
   Springs and the impact of mitigation strategies are investigated in this
   study. Experimental campaigns were performed to determine the
   characteristics of urban overheating. Advanced microclimate simulations
   were performed to develop mitigation scenarios. Further, ambient
   temperature measurements have been carried out for 11 months to assess
   the magnitude and characteristics of the urban heat island. During the
   night, the city was warmer than the surrounding desert environment with
   an average close to 4.1 ?C, while it presented cooler temperatures by
   2.7 ?C during morning hours. Microclimate models developed to assess the
   influence of the proposed mitigation strategies found a possibility to
   decrease the maximum ambient temperature of Alice Springs up to
   approximately 1.1 ?C using the combination of mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate
   change},
Journal = {GEO-GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to
   combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly
   intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems
   have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so,
   actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable
   co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence
   of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity
   conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for
   actions that identify specific targets for greening or green
   infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an
   indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate
   to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment
   management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from
   nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of
   threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city
   climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a
   key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous
   opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal
   and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at
   least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58
   city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28
   million km(2). However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a
   total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed.
   Just 18\% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote
   biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate
   adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient
   opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and
   city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate
   adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Transient scenarios for robust climate change adaptation illustrated for
   water management in The Netherlands},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate scenarios are used to explore impacts of possible future
   climates and to assess the robustness of adaptation actions across a
   range of futures. Time-dependent climate scenarios are commonly used in
   mitigation studies. However, despite the dynamic nature of adaptation,
   most scenarios for local or regional decision making on climate
   adaptation are static `endpoint' projections. This paper describes the
   development and use of transient (time-dependent) scenarios by means of
   a case on water management in the Netherlands. Relevant boundary
   conditions (sea level, precipitation and evaporation) were constructed
   by generating an ensemble of synthetic time-series with a rainfall
   generator and a transient delta change method. Climate change impacted
   river flows were then generated with a hydrological simulation model for
   the Rhine basin. The transient scenarios were applied in model
   simulations and game experiments. We argue that there are at least three
   important assets of using transient scenarios for supporting robust
   climate adaptation: (1) raise awareness about (a) the implications of
   climate variability and climate change for decision making and (b) the
   difficulty of finding proof of climate change in relevant variables for
   water management; (2) assessment of when to adapt by identifying
   adaptation tipping points which can then be used to explore adaptation
   pathways, and (3) identification of triggers for climate adaptation.},

Title = {Hard or soft flood adaptation? Advantages of a hybrid strategy for
   Shanghai},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Flood risk is expected to increase in coastal cities, particularly in
   Asian megacities such as Shanghai. This paper presents an integrated
   modeling framework to simulate changes in the flood risk in Shanghai and
   provide a cost-benefit analysis of multiple adaptation strategies used
   to reduce risk. The results show that the potential flood risk will
   increase dramatically as a result of sea level rise, land subsidence,
   and socioeconomic development. By 2100, the expected annual damage could
   reach 0.8\% (uncertainty range: 0.4\%-1.4\%) of local GDP under an
   optimistic emission scenario (RCP4.5), compared to the current value of
   0.03\%. All of the adaptation strategies can effectively reduce the
   flood risk under the current conditions and those in 2050. In contrast
   to the `hard' flood protection strategies (i.e., storm-surge barriers
   and floodwalls), the `soft' strategies (i.e., building codes and
   nature-based measures) cannot substantially reduce the flood risk in
   2100. However, the soft strategies can play a critical role in reducing
   the residual risk resulting from the hard strategies. A `hybrid'
   strategy combining a storm-surge barrier, wet-proofing, and coastal
   wetland development outperforms both hard and soft strategies in terms
   of low residual risk and high benefit/cost ratio. Additionally, the
   hybrid strategy can also enable a larger reduction in casualties. These
   findings imply that managing flood risk is more than the use of single
   adaptation measures. The methodology developed in this paper can
   enlighten Shanghai and other coastal cities on an economically and
   socially feasible adaptation strategy in an uncertain future.},

   Case Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal areas are home to more than 2 billion people around the globe
   and, as such, are especially vulnerable to climate change consequences.
   Climate change adaptation has proven to be more effective on a local
   scale, contributing to a bottom-up approach to the problems related to
   the changing climate. Portugal has approximately 2000 km of coastline,
   with 75\% of the population living along the coast. Therefore, this
   research had the main objective of understanding adaptation processes at
   a local scale, using Portuguese coastal municipalities as a case study.
   To achieve this goal, document analysis and a questionnaire to coastal
   municipalities were applied, and the existence of measures rooted in
   nature-based solutions, green infrastructures, and community-based
   adaptation was adopted as a variable. The main conclusion from this
   research is that 87\% of the municipalities that answered the
   questionnaire have climate change adaptation strategies implemented or
   in development. Moreover, it was possible to conclude that 90\% of the
   municipalities are familiar with the concept of nature-based solutions
   and all the municipalities with adaptation strategies include green
   infrastructure. However, it was also possible to infer that
   community-based adaptation is a concept that most municipalities do not
   know about or undervalue.},

Title = {An integrated geological and GIS-based method to assess caprock risk in

Abstract = {Subsurface injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a technique to enhance
   oil recovery and so the economic value of depleting fields. It
   complements carbon capture and storage, which is a key technology to
   mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, an integrated method
   developed by the British Geological Survey and Cardiff University uses
   high-resolution 3D seismic and borehole data from the Jaren High to
   analyse potential seal breaches and fluid flow paths in a frontier area
   of the North Sea, ultimately assessing the risk of a possible carbon
   capture and storage site. We integrate the spatial analysis of
   subsurface fluid flow features with borehole and geochemical data to
   model the burial and thermal history of potential storage sites,
   estimating the timing of fluid expulsion. On seismic data, fluid pipes
   connect reservoir intervals of different ages. Spatial analysis reveals
   clustering of fluid flow features above strata grounded onto deep
   reservoirs intervals. Our integrated method shows that gas matured from
   Dinantian coal and migrated up-dip during the Triassic-Jurassic into the
   lower sandstone reservoir of the Rotliegend Group. The containing seal
   rock was breached once sufficiently large volumes of gas generated high
   overpressures in the reservoir. Some of these fluid flow features may
   still be active conduits, as indicated by bright amplitude anomalies
   within the pipes. This study shows how integrated analyses may enhance
   our understanding of fluid-flow pathways, de-risking prospective sites
   for carbon capture and storage. The method proposed in this work is
   particularly important to assess the suitability of area with trapped
   gas pockets and understand tertiary migration in areas proposed for
   geological storage of CO2.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Current evidence is that climate change is occurring, it is largely
   manmade and it will have significant implications for human
   civilisation. Australia is particularly vulnerable to the anticipated
   effects of climate change, creating major challenges for water resource
   management and water supply security. Climate change adaptation offers a
   means by which we can reduce our exposure to future climate change
   risks, whilst at the same time exploiting any potential benefits that
   may arise from climatic changes. This review outlines the current major
   climate change adaptation challenges facing the water supply industry at
   large, with a particular focus on these challenges in an Australian
   context. It also aims to highlight the critical knowledge gaps and
   strategies required to assist in the formulation of adaptation responses
   to the range of potential impacts on water infrastructure and future
   water security. A diverse range of management and assessment techniques
   are used by relevant professions in industry. Here, an adaptive
   management approach is presented highlighting the important information
   required for robust assessment.},

Title = {Resolving environmental issues in the southern Brazilian artisanal
   penaeid-trawl fishery through adaptive co-management},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {133-141},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many conventional management strategies have been demonstrated to be
   ineffective in achieving sustainable fisheries, and new approaches are
   required to overcome existing environmental, social and economic
   problems. Adaptive co-management represents the combination of a
   learning-by-doing approach (adaptive management) involving all related
   and legitimate stakeholders in the decision-making process
   (collaborative management). In this study, the relevant experiences from
   a fishery in southern Brazil are reported. The first section of the
   paper summarizes the broad history of national fisheries and their
   management. Then the southern Brazilian artisanal penaeid-trawl fishery
   is briefly described and the three main problems associated with the
   common gears used are discussed, including their (1) poor size and
   species selectivities, (2) poor efficiencies, and (3) their mechanical
   impacts on benthic habitats. Finally, a framework is proposed to address
   the environmental and socioeconomic issues in the fishery and its
   implementation discussed via an adaptive co-management approach. (C)

Title = {Reservoir simulation study of CO2 storage in formations containing both

Abstract = {Geological storage of CO2 is a viable option for the mitigation of
   greenhouse gas emissions. Formations such as saline aquifers and coal
   seams have distinct storage mechanisms; in saline aquifers, the CO2 is
   mainly stored by compression and/or dissolution in the formation fluid,
   whereas in coal seams, the CO2 is primarily stored by adsorption. To
   investigate the impact of CO2 dissolution in formation fluid on CO2
   storage in coal and enhanced coalbed methane production, two scenarios
   are considered (1) CO2 injection and coalbed methane production for a
   single coal seam, (2) CO2 injection in two coal seams with an aquifer
   in-between while coalbed methane is produced in the upper coal seam. It
   is found that although CO2 dissolution in formation water is not the
   main storage mechanism in coal reservoirs, including CO2 dissolution can
   lead to significant differences in the simulation results. In addition,
   including CO2 dissolution leads to more accurate description of the ECBM
   process through more accurate prediction of water saturation and thus
   the gas effective permeability, the overall reservoir pressure and gas
   flow response to CO2 injection. The results also suggest that for CO2
   storage in lower rank coals, which usually have higher porosity and
   permeability, CO2 dissolution in the formation water should be
   considered in order to more accurately describe the CO2 storage and ECBM
   behaviour. The results also show that water containing formations in
   between the coal seams, although often low in porosity and thus
   insignificant in overall CO2 storage capacity, also have a significant
   impact on the overall CO2 storage and enhanced coalbed methane recovery
   behaviours when considering CO2 dissolution modelling in formation
   waters. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Managing Mediterranean soil resources under global change: expected

Abstract = {The soils of the Mediterranean Basin are the products of soil processes
   that have been governed by a unique convergence of highly differentiated
   natural and anthropogenic drivers. These soils are expected to be
   dramatically affected by future climate and societal changes. These
   changes imply that suitable adaptive management strategies for these
   resources cannot simply be transposed from experiments that are
   performed in other regions of the world. Following a framework that
   considers the chain of ``drivers-soil process-soil capital-ecosystem
   services/disservices,{''} the paper review the research undertaken in
   the Mediterranean area on three types of Mediterranean soil degradation
   than can be expected under global change: (i) soil losses due to the
   increase of drought and torrential rainfall; (ii) soil salinization due
   the increase of droughts, irrigation, and sea level; and (iii) soil
   carbon stock depletion with the increase of temperature and droughts.
   The possible strategies for mitigating each of these degradations have
   been largely addressed and are still studied in current research
   projects. They should include changes in agricultural practices, soil
   water management, and vegetal material. As a pre-requisite for the
   site-specific adaptations of such mitigation strategies within viable
   Mediterranean agrosystems, it is highlighted that methodological
   advances are necessary in integrated assessment of agricultural systems
   and in finer resolution soil mapping.},

   natural, nature-based, structural, and non-structural features may
   better achieve a broad set of goals such as ecological enhancement,
   long-term adaptation, and social benefits, but broad consideration and
   uptake of these approaches has been slow. One barrier to the widespread
   implementation of hybrid solutions is the lack of a relatively quick but
   holistic evaluation framework that places these broader environmental
   and societal goals on equal footing with the more traditional goal of
   exposure reduction. To respond to this need, the Adaptive Gradients
   Framework was developed and pilot-tested as a qualitative, flexible, and
   collaborative process guide for organizations to understand, evaluate,
   and potentially select more diverse kinds of infrastructural responses.
   These responses would ideally include natural, nature-based, and
   regulatory/cultural approaches, as well as hybrid designs combining
   multiple approaches. It enables rapid expert review of project designs
   based on eight metrics called ``gradients{''}, which include exposure
   reduction, cost efficiency, institutional capacity, ecological
   enhancement, adaptation over time, greenhouse gas reduction,
   participatory process, and social benefits. The framework was
   conceptualized and developed in three phases: relevant factors and
   barriers were collected from practitioners and experts by survey; these
   factors were ranked by importance and used to develop the initial
   framework; several case studies were iteratively evaluated using this
   technique; and the framework was finalized for implementation. The
   article presents the framework and a pilot test of its application,
   along with resources that would enable wider application of the
   framework by practitioners and theorists.},

Title = {Integrating climate change adaptation in coastal governance of the
   Barcelona metropolitan area},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal cities are exposed to high risks due to climate change, as they
   are potentially affected by both rising sea levels and increasingly
   intense and frequent coastal storms. Socio-economic drivers also
   increase exposure to natural hazards, accelerate environmental
   degradation, and require adaptive governance structures to moderate
   negative impacts. Here, we use a social network analysis (SNA) combined
   with further qualitative information to identify barriers and enablers
   of adaptive governance in the Barcelona metropolitan area. By analyzing
   how climate change adaptation is mainstreamed between different
   administrative scales as well as different societal actors, we can
   determine the governance structures and external conditions that hamper
   or foster strategical adaptation plans from being used as operational
   adaptation tools. We identify a diverse set of stakeholders acting at
   different administrative levels (local to national), in public
   administration, science, civil society, and the tourism economy. The
   metropolitan administration acts as an important bridging organization
   by promoting climate change adaptation to different interest groups and
   by passing knowledge between actors. Nonetheless, national adaptation
   planning fails to take into account local experiences in coastal
   protection, which leads to an ineffective science policy interaction and
   limits adaptive management and learning opportunities. Overcoming this
   is difficult, however, as the effectiveness of local adaptation
   strategies in the Barcelona metropolitan area is very limited due to a
   strong centralization of power at the national level and a lack of
   polycentricity. Due to the high touristic pressure, the legal framework
   is currently oriented to primarily meet the demands of recreational use
   and tourism, prioritizing these aspects in daily management practice.
   Therefore, touristic and economic activities need to be aligned to
   adaptation efforts, to convert them from barriers into drivers for
   adaptation action. Our work strongly suggests that more effectively
   embedding adaptation planning and action into existing legal structures
   of coastal management would allow strategic adaptation plans to be an
   effective operational tool for local coastal governance.},

Abstract = {Small island states around the world are among the areas most vulnerable
   to climate change and sea level rise. In this paper, we present results
   from an innovative methodology for a quantitative assessment of multiple
   hazards on coastal risks, driven by different hydro-meteorological
   events, and including the effects of climate change. Moreover, we take
   an additional step by including in the methodology the option to assess
   and compare the effectiveness of possible disaster risk reduction
   measures. The methodology is applied to a real case study at the island
   of Ebeye (the Republic of the Marshall Islands). An example is provided
   in which a rock revetment is implemented as a risk reduction measure for
   the island. Results show that yearly expected damages may increase, by
   the end of the century, by a factor of three to four, depending on the
   sea level rise scenario considered, while the number of yearly affected
   people may double. Putting a cap on the temperature increase (e.g. 1.5
   vs. 2 degrees C) according to the Paris Agreement may reduce damages and
   number of affected people by about 20 and 15\%, respectively. However,
   impacts for same warming levels can vary substantially among different
   emission scenarios. Disaster risk reduction measures can be useful for
   mitigating risks in current and future situations but should be
   incorporated within long-term adaptive planning for these islands.},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation and mitigation decisions made by governments
   are usually taken in different policy domains. At the individual level
   however, adaptation and mitigation activities are undertaken together as
   part of the management of risk and resources. We propose that a useful
   starting point to develop a national climate policy is to understand
   what societal response might mean in practice. First we frame the set of
   responses at the national policy level as a trade off between investment
   in the development and diffusion of new technology, and investment in
   encouraging and enabling society to change its behaviour and or adopt
   the new technology. We argue that these are the pertinent trade-offs,
   rather than those usually posited between climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. The preference for a policy response that focuses more on
   technological innovation rather than one that focuses on changing social
   behaviour will be influenced by the capacity of different societies to
   change their greenhouse gas emissions; by perceived vulnerability to
   climate impacts; and by capacity to modify social behaviour and physical
   environment. Starting with this complete vision of response options
   should enable policy makers to re-evaluate the risk environment and the
   set of response options available to them. From here, policy makers
   should consider who is responsible for making climate response decisions
   and when actions should be taken. Institutional arrangements dictate
   social and political acceptability of different policies, they structure
   worldviews, and they determine the provision of resources for investment
   in technological innovation and social change. The importance of
   focussing on the timing of the response is emphasised to maximise the
   potential for adjustments through social learning and institutional
   change at different policy scales. We argue that the ability to respond
   to climate change is both enabled and constrained by social and
   technological conditions. The ability of society to respond to climate
   change and the need for technological change for both decarbonisation
   and for dealing with surprise in general, are central to concepts of
   sustainable development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Number = {15},
Pages = {6471-6489},

Abstract = {Projecting future change of monsoon rainfall is essential for water
   resource management, food security, disaster mitigation, and
   infrastructure planning. Here we assess the future change and explore
   the causes of the changes using 15 models that participated in phase 6
   of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The multimodel
   ensemble projects that, under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP)
   2-4.5, the total land monsoon rainfall will likely increase in the
   Northern Hemisphere (NH) by about 2.8\% per one degree Celsius of global
   warming (2.8\% degrees C-1) in contrast to little change in the Southern
   Hemisphere (SH; 20.3\% degrees C-1). In addition, in the future the
   Asian-northern African monsoon likely becomes wetter while the North
   American monsoon becomes drier. Since the humidity increase is nearly
   uniform in all summer monsoon regions, the dynamic processes must play a
   fundamental role in shaping the spatial patterns of the global monsoon
   changes. Greenhouse gas (GHG) radiative forcing induces a
   ``NH-warmer-than-SH{''} pattern, which favors increasing the NHmonsoon
   rainfall and prolonging the NH monsoon rainy season while reducing the
   SH monsoon rainfall and shortening the SH monsoon rainy season. The GHG
   forcing induces a ``land-warmer-than-ocean{''} pattern, which enhances
   Asian monsoon low pressure and increases Asian and northern African
   monsoon rainfall, and an El Nino-like warming, which reduces North
   American monsoon rainfall. The uncertainties in the projected monsoon
   precipitation changes are significantly related to the models' projected
   hemispheric and land-ocean thermal contrasts as well as to the eastern
   Pacific Ocean warming. The CMIP6 models' common biases and the processes
   by which convective heating drives monsoon circulation are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {As potential contributors to climate change mitigation and reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions, and drivers of economic growth, harnessing
   offshore renewable energies (ORE) depends on safe and reliable
   technology, appropriate policy and regulatory instruments, and stable
   sources of funding. However, the nature, location and maturity of ORE
   have led to several legal and policy challenges which condition the
   success of these industries.
   Even though the ability to generate electricity from marine renewables
   is not in question, since technology is moving ahead of policy, its
   integration in wider energy networks might be problematic given the
   localised nature of the resources, and the high variability/low
   predictability of their output over multiple timescales.
   Limited practical experience with the deployment of these technologies
   coupled with the difficulty of studying the marine environment represent
   barriers to acquiring knowledge on their impacts, particularly wave and
   tidal energy. These data gaps are amplified by underdeveloped regulatory
   frameworks regarding marine planning and sitting processes, including
   Environmental Impact Assessment, not adapted to manage uncertainty, and
   often making it too difficult for potential developers to get consent
   and thus invest.
   As part of EU's Blue Growth Strategy, ORE's demand for exclusive rights
   over resources and a marine space creates potential conflicts by
   entering already congested oceans, traditionally regulated in a
   single-sector manner for different marine activities.
   Previously proposed solutions to these constraints have failed to
   acknowledge the combined importance of all types of environmental policy
   instruments: evolving legal frameworks, targets and commitments;
   practical differences in domestic implementation of regulation,
   market-based and suasive instruments; and fragmentation of institutional
   architectures associated with constantly evolving actor networks
   operating for ORE governance. Studying policy instrument mixes might
   demonstrate the changing roles of state and societal actors, and
   ultimately contribute for the debate surrounding the sustainability and
   governance transition to renewable energy.},

Abstract = {The Paris Agreement requires measurement of the progress made on
   adaptation. Tracking the progress made by governments through analysis
   of policies provides insight into the goals and means to achieve
   adaptation targets. Here we show the current state-of-the-art in public
   adaptation planning affecting 136 of the largest coastal port urban
   agglomerations, covering 68 countries. We identify 226 adaptation
   policies: 88 at national level, 57 at regional/state level and 81 at
   city/metropolitan level. This set of adaptation policies can be
   considered the latest, most up-to-date database of governmental and
   public-led adaptations. Our analyses show that (1) in one half of cases,
   there is no evidence of policy implementation, (2) in almost 85\% of
   cases, planned adaptation actions are not driven by present or future
   climatic impacts or risks, and (3) formal adaptation planning is
   relatively recent and is concentrated in more developed areas and
   countries.},

Title = {Developing Urban Heat Mitigation Strategies for a Historic Area Using a
   High-Fidelity Parametric Numerical Simulation: A Case Study in Singapore},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The coexistence of developed areas and historic buildings is an
   important topic in urban planning. Our study focuses on this topic from
   the perspective of urban microclimate. A multi-physics CFD simulation is
   applied to model urban microclimate with anthropogenic heat and buoyancy
   effects. First, we clarified the impact of new development, i.e.,
   high-rises on pedestrian-level air flow by comparing city structures in
   Case A (the past, 1960s) and Case B (the current, 2020s). The results
   showed an average wind speed decrease of 43\% over time. Second, we
   assessed air temperature increments from anthropogenic heat emitted from
   Case C (high-rises), Case D (historic buildings), and Case E (both). We
   found that the mean air temperature increased by 0.16 degrees C for Case
   C, 0.52 degrees C for Case D, and 0.87 degrees C for Case E,
   respectively. Third, we developed heat mitigation strategies based on
   the assessment results in the previous steps. The integration of open
   spaces and building porosity, which create wind corridors together, can
   promote outdoor ventilation and heat dispersion in the study area.
   Compared with Case E, the three mitigation cases improve outdoor thermal
   environment, with mean temperature reductions of 33\%, 25\%, and 21\%,
   respectively. Finally, we developed new mitigation strategies by
   considering the constraints in this special region, where modernity and
   history coexist. Our practical mitigation strategies will aid urban
   planning and support conservation efforts not only in Singapore, but
   also in other tropical and subtropical cities.},

Volume = {166},
Pages = {1169-1174},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Risk management is an effective way to mitigate the adverse consequences
   of extreme events, and plays an important role in climate change
   adaptation. On the basis of the literature, this paper presents a
   conceptual framework for managing the risk of extreme events under
   climate change, and accordingly summarizes the recent developments with
   a focus on several key topics. In terms of risk determinants, the
   impacts of climate variability on the frequency of extreme events are
   addressed, and the various meanings and measurements of specific
   vulnerability are compared. As for the process of risk management, the
   dynamic assessment approach regarding future climate condition is
   emphasized. Besides, in view of decision making the available means to
   enhance the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation strategies are
   highlighted. Finally, uncertainty is discussed with respect to its
   sources and solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A zero-dimensional energy balance model was previously developed to
   serve as a user-friendly mitigation tool for practitioners seeking to
   study the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Accordingly, this established
   model is applied here to show the relative effects of four common
   mitigation strategies: increasing the overall (1) emissivity, (2)
   percentage of vegetated area, (3) thermal conductivity, and (4) albedo
   of the urban environment in a series of percentage increases by 5, 10,
   15, and 20\% from baseline values. In addition to modeling mitigation
   strategies, we present how the model can be utilized to evaluate human
   health vulnerability from excessive heat-related events, based on
   heat-related emergency service data from 2002 to 2006. The 24-h average
   heat index is shown to have the greatest correlation to heat-related
   emergency calls in the Phoenix (Arizona, USA) metropolitan region. The
   four modeled UHI mitigation strategies, taken in combination, would lead
   to a 48\% reduction in annual heat-related emergency service calls,
   where increasing the albedo is the single most effective UHI mitigation
   strategy.},

Title = {A portfolio of climate-tailored approaches to advance the design of

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {17},

Abstract = {Intensified coastal development is compromising the health and
   functioning of marine ecosystems. A key example of this is the Red Sea,
   a biodiversity hotspot subjected to increasing local human pressures.
   While some marine-protected areas (MPAs) were placed to alleviate these
   stressors, it is unclear whether these MPAs are managed or enforced,
   thus providing limited protection. Yet, most importantly, MPAs in the
   Red Sea were not designed using climate considerations, likely
   diminishing their effectiveness against global stressors. Here, we
   propose to tailor the design of MPAs in the Red Sea by integrating
   approaches to enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation. First,
   including coral bleaching susceptibility could produce a more resilient
   network of MPAs by safeguarding reefs from different thermal regions
   that vary in spatiotemporal bleaching responses, reducing the risk that
   all protected reefs will bleach simultaneously. Second, preserving the
   basin-wide genetic connectivity patterns that are assisted by mesoscale
   eddies could further ensure recovery of sensitive populations and
   maintain species potential to adapt to environmental changes. Finally,
   protecting mangrove forests in the northern and southern Red Sea that
   act as major carbon sinks could help offset greenhouse gas emissions. If
   implemented with multinational cooperation and concerted effort among
   stakeholders, our portfolio of climate-tailored approaches may help
   build a network of MPAs in the Red Sea that protects more effectively
   its coastal resources against escalating coastal development and climate
   instability. Beyond the Red Sea, we anticipate this study to serve as an
   example of how to improve the utility of tropical MPAs as
   climate-informed conservation tools.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {A downscaling experiment linking a regional atmospheric model to local
   ecosystem and target species population dynamics models was conducted to
   evaluate the effects of IPCC climate change scenarios on a temperate
   coastal lagoon ecosystem, the lagoon of Venice (Italy), along with goods
   and services provided by this ecosystem. Our results indicate that the
   changes in water temperature and reduction in plankton productivity
   caused by the modification of seasonal precipitation patterns will
   affect habitat suitability for clam growth and aquaculture. Simulations
   show that aquaculture, which has substantial economic value, will
   suffer, and they highlight the need for management policies to mitigate
   the adverse effects of climate change. Extrapolation of these
   conclusions to other coastal systems might be particularly relevant for
   socio-economic systems in which clam farming is crucial for a
   self-sustaining economy.},

   transportation considering spatial autocorrelation},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {87-94},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper reports the impacts of economic analysis results on sea-level
   rise adaptation decision making with different economic analysis
   methods. The methodology was applied to Hillsborough County, Florida. A
   general conclusion is that partial shoreline protection should be
   implemented to reduce the potential impacts of sea-level rise on
   important land use, then transportation infrastructure is preferred to
   be protected or accommodated, and finally managed relocation should be
   adopted. More specifically, the results show that the best adaptation
   strategy is shoreline protection plus transportation infrastructure
   accommodation; the length of shoreline protection plays an important
   role in the economic analysis results, and shoreline protection and
   accommodation adaptation strategies for all areas are not recommended
   because of either high costs or low benefits; the value of travel time
   saving and spatial autocorrelation play important roles in the economic
   analysis results of accommodation strategy, which highlights the
   importance of including indirect economic factors and spatial
   autocorrelation impacts when making sea-level rise adaptation decisions.

Title = {Detection and Characterization of Low Temperature Peat Fires during the
   2015 Fire Catastrophe in Indonesia Using a New High-Sensitivity Fire
   Monitoring Satellite Sensor (FireBird)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Vast and disastrous fires occurred on Borneo during the 2015 dry season,
   pushing Indonesia into the top five carbon emitting countries. The
   region was affected by a very strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   climate phenomenon, on par with the last severe event in 1997/98. Fire
   dynamics in Central Kalimantan were investigated using an innovative
   sensor offering higher sensitivity to a wider range of fire intensities
   at a finer spatial resolution (160 m) than heretofore available. The
   sensor is onboard the TET-1 satellite, part of the German Aerospace
   Center (DLR) FireBird mission. TET-1 images (acquired every 2-3 days)
   from the middle infrared were used to detect fires continuously burning
   for almost three weeks in the protected peatlands of Sebangau National
   Park as well as surrounding areas with active logging and oil palm
   concessions. TET-1 detection capabilities were compared with MODIS
   active fire detection and Landsat burned area algorithms. Fire dynamics,
   including fire front propagation speed and area burned, were
   investigated. We show that TET-1 has improved detection capabilities
   over MODIS in monitoring low-intensity peatland fire fronts through
   thick smoke and haze. Analysis of fire dynamics revealed that the
   largest burned areas resulted from fire front lines started from
   multiple locations, and the highest propagation speeds were in excess of
   500 m/day (all over peat > 2m deep). Fires were found to occur most
   often in concessions that contained drainage infrastructure but were not
   cleared prior to the fire season. Benefits of implementing this sensor
   system to improve current fire management techniques are discussed. Near
   real-time fire detection together with enhanced fire behavior monitoring
   capabilities would not only improve firefighting efforts, but also
   benefit analysis of fire impact on tropical peatlands, greenhouse gas
   emission estimations as well as mitigation measures to reduce severe
   fire events in the future.},

Abstract = {A simple energy balance model is created for use in developing
   mitigation strategies for the urban heat island effect. The model is
   initially applied to the city of Phoenix, Arizona. There are six primary
   contributions to the overall energy balance: incident solar radiation,
   anthropogenic heat input, conduction heat loss, outgoing
   evapotranspiration, outgoing convection, and outgoing emitted radiation.
   Meteorological data are input to the model, which then computes an urban
   characteristic temperature at a calculated time step for a specified
   time range. The model temperature is shown to have the same periodic
   behavior as the experimentally measured air temperatures. Predicted
   temperature changes, caused by increasing the average urban albedo,
   agree within 0.1 degrees C with comparable maximum surface temperature
   predictions from the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State
   University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model
   (MM5). The present model, while maintaining valid energy-balance
   physics, allows users to quickly and easily predict the relative effects
   of urban heat island mitigation measures. Representative mitigation
   strategies, namely changes in average albedo and long-wavelength
   emissivity are presented here. Increasing the albedo leads to the
   greater reduction in daytime maximum temperatures; increasing the
   emissivity leads to a greater reduction in nighttime minimum
   temperatures.},

Abstract = {Heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks have been acquiring more frequency
   and intensity in the Canary Islands during the last decades. Both
   climatic hazards are known to produce impacts on human health such as
   mortality (due to heat waves) and morbidity (due to dusty weather). This
   work addresses possible climate adaptation policies in Tenerife assuming
   the increasing impact of heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks in the
   island under a climate change scenario. It explores the institutional
   setting of climate change adaptation planning in Tenerife and evaluates
   the statu quo of adaptation planning in the island through the
   engagement of key social actors. An historical review of the local and
   regional press articles and legislation, an in-depth round of
   interviews, together with questionnaires to the main social actors
   allows framing the social and political context in which climate change
   adaptation in Tenerife is embedded. Key social actors were engaged,
   including international organisations, atmospheric research centres,
   local Universities, regional and insular governments, trade unions, and
   environmental NGOs, among others. The main obstacles mentioned by the
   social actors that hinder the development of an effective climate
   adaptation policy address scientific knowledge, data collection and
   policy making, focusing on the uncertainty of climate models, the lack
   of epidemiological data and contrasting opinions regarding the existing
   climate adaptation policies. Public participation, mainstreaming of
   climate policies and an integrated approach between mitigation and
   adaptation plans were identified as key policy issues. The outcomes of
   this study could be meaningful for climate adaptation initiatives at
   local or regional level, such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, that
   intend to promote climate resilience through the setup of climate
   adaptation strategies and plans at municipality level.},

Title = {THE POSIDONIA OCEANICA MATTE: A UNIQUE COASTAL CARBON SINK FOR CLIMATE

Journal = {VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},

Pages = {17-24},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows have long been recognized for their high ecological and
   economic value (ecosystem services). More recently, a potential role in
   climate regulation, due to their ability to fix and sequester carbon,
   has been the focus of intensive study. In the Mediterranean Sea, the
   matte, a specific structure built by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, is
   of particular interest because it keeps buried for thousands of years
   massive amounts of carbon. Recent studies carried out along the Corsican
   coasts show a mean fixation of 1.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), with a
   sequestration rate of between 27 and 30 \%, a mean matte thickness of
   210 cm and 711 Mg C ha(-1) of organic carbon trapped in the matte. That
   is to say, a stock corresponding to 1,580 years of P. oceanica carbon
   sequestration, confirmed by radiocarbon analysis. An extrapolation to
   the Mediterranean basin (1.0 to 1.5 million hectares covered by P.
   oceanica meadow; mean matte thickness: 210 cm) shows that the total
   stock of organic carbon sequestered in the P. oceanica matte might be as
   much as 711 to 1,067 million Mg C. The conservation of the P. oceanica
   meadows thus constitutes an issue of major importance since any
   degradation of the matte, which has been built up over the past
   millennia, would very likely result in the release of considerable
   quantities of carbon. Rather than playing a major role in the
   attenuation of the impact of climate change (blue carbon sequestration),
   the P. oceanica meadow would then become a source of carbon that would
   be likely to amplify the greenhouse gas emissions. Management of P.
   oceanica meadows should take into account not only their role in carbon
   sequestration, but also the whole the full range of their ecosystem
   services, in relation with the functioning of the ecosystem.},

Title = {Typology of Climate Change Adaptation Measures in Polish Cities up to
   2030},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Poland, like other countries in the world, increasingly experiences the
   ongoing climate change. However, the level of preparation of the country
   and its society for climate change in the second decade of the 21st
   century can be evaluated as low. The Municipal Adaptation Plans (MAPs)
   created in 2017-2019 became a subject of research studies whose main
   goal was to determine the typology of adaptation actions to be
   undertaken as part of MAPs in the 14 selected Polish cities in various
   geographical regions. Moreover, the type and scope of intended actions
   were analysed according to the planned amount of expenditure and from
   the perspective of sectors. The tasks accepted for implementation up to
   2030 mainly relate to modernisation and development of transport systems
   and to actions connected with physical infrastructure. A large number of
   tasks and even a bigger scale of financial sources planned in the
   analysed MAPs for mitigation actions show that Polish cities are at an
   initial stage of actions for climate protection. The typology of
   adaptation actions which the work proposes may be helpful in research
   carried out in countries of a similar level of preparation for
   adaptation to climate change.},

Abstract = {Past and present climate has shaped the valued ecosystems currently
   protected in parks and reserves, but future climate change will redefine
   these conditions. Continued conservation as climate changes will require
   thinking differently about resource management than we have in the past;
   we present some logical steps and tools for doing so. Three critical
   tenets underpin future management plans and activities: (1) climate
   patterns of the past will not be the climate patterns of the future; (2)
   climate defines the environment and influences future trajectories of
   the distributions of species and their habitats; (3) specific management
   actions may help increase the resilience of some natural resources, but
   fundamental changes in species and their environment may be inevitable.
   Science-based management will be necessary because past experience may
   not serve as a guide for novel future conditions. Identifying resources
   and processes at risk, defining thresholds and reference conditions, and
   establishing monitoring and assessment programs are among the types of
   scientific practices needed to support a broadened portfolio of
   management activities. In addition to the control and hedging management
   strategies commonly in use today, we recommend adaptive management
   wherever possible. Adaptive management increases our ability to address
   the multiple scales at which species and processes function, and
   increases the speed of knowledge transfer among scientists and managers.
   Scenario planning provides a broad forward-thinking framework from which
   the most appropriate management tools can be chosen. The scope of
   climate change effects will require a shared vision among regional
   partners. Preparing for and adapting to climate change is as much a
   cultural and intellectual challenge as an ecological challenge.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to their vulnerability, understanding the impacts of global warming
   on rainfall is important for a tropical country and islands. This
   research aimed to assess the impact of global warming on rainfall in
   Madagascar, using the Mann-Kendall test, continuous wavelet transform,
   and polynomial regression. The result showed that the annual, seasonal
   maximum, and minimum temperature increased, while elevation amplified
   the increase of maximum temperature. Different trends in rainfall were
   found in the 22 regions of Madagascar but in general, the increasing
   trend in rainfall was prominent at a higher elevation than lower
   elevation. The annual rainfall decreased up to -5 mm per year for the
   regions located below 450 m of altitude while increased up to +5 mm per
   year above 500 m. We found that the wet becomes wetter with an important
   increase in rainfall in summer and the increase in temperature
   influenced the rainfall. The annual rainfall increased with temperature
   and elevation. However, if the increase in temperature was more than
   0.03 degrees C per year, the annual rainfall increased regardless of
   elevation. The knowledge of the elevation dependence of the impact of
   warming on rainfall is important for water resources management and
   climate change adaptation strategies, especially for island nations and
   African countries.},

Abstract = {Saline intrusion (SI) is increasing at an accelerating rate in the
   coastal zones of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). This challenges
   various crop production practices in these areas. Using ecological and
   social approaches, this paper aims to explore farmers' perceptions of SI
   occurring in Tra Vinh and Kien Giang provinces, and their adaptation
   measures to deal with the situation. A mixed-method approach was used,
   including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household
   surveys. The results demonstrated that farmers have implemented various
   adaptation measures in tackling SI impacts. High market demand for
   shrimp also contributed to farmers' decisions in shifting farming
   practices. The study underscores the important role of the integrated
   shrimp-rice system as a more comparatively sustainable model to the
   intensive shrimp culture in the face of SI. Qualitative analysis
   revealed water conflicts occurring in mixed rice and shrimp farming
   areas driven by the poor performance of combined irrigation and drainage
   systems together with the undefined water demarcation zones between rice
   and shrimp farmers. The paper provides better insights into how farmers'
   adaptation strategies could facilitate decision-making processes with
   regard to water management and adaptation policies in the coastal areas.
   It calls for local governments' attention to modifying water
   infrastructure to better address water-related issues.},

Series = {Environment \& Policy},

Volume = {50},
Pages = {429-443},
Abstract = {This concluding chapter seeks to systematize the mitigative and adaptive
   responses to climate change considered by the different authors of this
   volume by posing four questions: who is charged with adaptation and
   mitigation, which adaptive and mitigative measures are being targeted,
   what are the means for adaptation and mitigation, and, finally, are the
   suggested actions able to support expressed aims for adaptation and
   mitigation? The discussion of these questions reveals the importance of
   the current institutional contexts in the framing of adaptation and
   mitigation issues. It also emphasises the importance of context and the
   variety of adaptive measures that are being considered, both within
   national and local contexts but also within the patchwork of different
   international regimes that touch the Arctic. The chapter concludes by
   canvassing recent governance developments and especially the initiative
   of the five coastal states (the Ilulissat Declaration) and that of the
   European Union. These developments have the potential to challenge
   existing governance structures based on the eight member states of the
   Arctic Council and its system of permanent representatives.},

   is a high-risk province due to hydrometeorological and geophysical

   Livelihoods Approach shows that a soft adaptation strategy focusing on
   enhancing human and social capital needs to be undertaken to increase
   adaptive capacity and build resilience in the study area. Moreover, the
   micro-level variations in the villages suggest that the understanding of
   local conditions is indispensable in planning and formulation of

Title = {Policy recommendations to increase urban heat stress resilience},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {51-63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As the frequency and intensity of heatwaves are growing, strategies to
   improve our resilience are becoming more vital. Policies to increase
   heat stress resilience are mostly isolated across different disciplines
   and government departments. A holistic approach would be necessary that
   mitigates the numerous negative impacts of heatwaves on public health,
   urban infrastructure and services through adaptation to heatwaves in the
   realm of public health, building and construction industry, and urban
   planning and infrastructure.
   This paper reviews the research on heat stress adaptation measures,
   before presenting recommendations for a range of integrated policy
   measures to increase the heat stress resilience of urban populations in
   Australian cities. The recommended policy measures include information
   dissemination, incentives and disincentives, promotion, demonstration
   and regulations. The paper concludes by identifying directions for
   further research and reinforcing the multiple benefits that can result
   from the implementation of heat stress resilience policies and
   strategies.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Climate-related risks in Central and South America have received
   increased attention and concern in science and policy, but an up-to-date
   comprehensive review and synthesis of risks and adaptation potential is
   currently missing. For this paper we evaluated over 200 peer-reviewed
   articles and grey literature documents published since 2012. We found
   that climate change in Central and South America during the 21st century
   may increase the risk to severe levels for the following topical risk
   clusters: (a) Food insecurity; (b) Floods and landslides; (c) Water
   scarcity; (d) Epidemics of vector-borne diseases; (e) Amazon Forest
   biome shift; (f). Coral bleaching; (g) Coastal risks of sea level rise,
   storm surges and erosion; (h) Systemic failure due to cascading impacts
   of hazards and epidemics. Our synthesis also identified feasible
   adaptation measures for each risk. The impacts of the risks will be
   heterogeneous throughout the region, with rural communities, Indigenous
   peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, women, disabled people, and migrants
   identified as being the most severely affected. We refer to a number of
   adaptation options for each risk. However, unabated climate change
   together with low adaptive capacity will strictly limit adaptation
   options. Immediate strengthening of policies for building adaptive
   capacity and increase of research on the risk-adaptation nexus in
   Central and South America are paramount. Our findings might contribute
   to guide the adjustment and emphasis of adaptation policies and climate
   risk management strategies from local to national level.},

Abstract = {Addressing vulnerabilities in small-scale fisheries (SSF) has been
   gaining increasing attention due to their role in securing livelihoods
   of millions of people in the world, even though when they are subject to
   susceptible scenarios. We reviewed the literature with the aim of
   shedding light on the distribution, coping strategies, and common
   drivers of vulnerabilities in worldwide SSF. Seventy-eight studied cases
   worldwide, 21 drivers of vulnerability, and 8 coping strategies were
   identified. Natural and human-induced declining fish catches was the
   most common driver of vulnerability and disobedience of fishing rules
   the most common coping strategy. From the three dimensions of
   vulnerability, exposure (presence of vulnerable scenarios) was the
   highest (50\%), followed by sensitivity (susceptibility to vulnerable
   scenarios) (29\%) and adaptive capacity (ability to cope with vulnerable
   scenarios) (21\%). The literature review highlights the need for
   adopting a context-specific threefold (resource management and
   conservation, livelihoods development, and restructured governance)
   approach to SSF management.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) problem, which is a major outcome of climate
   change, has been well documented and studied. Although it is globally
   observed due to climate change, local projections are needed to plan SLR
   adaptation strategies accurately. Since SLR is a community-wide
   multistakeholder problem at the local level, adaptation strategies can
   be more successful if the main stakeholders, e.g., government,
   residents, and businesses, collaborate in shaping them. Simulating the
   local socioeconomic system around SLR, including the interactions
   between essential stakeholders and nature, can be an effective way of
   evaluating different adaptation strategies and planning the best
   strategy for the local community. This work presents how such an SLR
   socioeconomic system can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)
   and simulated using multiagent reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed
   multiagent RL framework serves two purposes. It provides a general
   scenario planning tool to investigate the cost-benefit analysis of
   natural events (e.g., flooding and hurricane) and agents' investments
   (e.g., infrastructure improvement). It also shows how much the total
   cost due to SLR can be reduced over time by optimizing the adaptation
   strategies. We demonstrate the proposed scenario planning tool using
   available economic data and sea-level projections for Pinellas County,
   Florida, in a case study.},

Abstract = {In the context of increasing climate change, fishery-based livelihoods
   as major means of income and well-beings for millions of population in
   coastal communities around the world are most affected. Yet, available
   information how fishery-based livelihood system at local level are
   vulnerable to climate change, especially in developing countries is very
   limited. Using an indicator-based vulnerability assessment framework,
   this study examined the household-level vulnerability of fishery-based
   livelihoods in two coastal communities in Central Vietnam. The results
   showed that the nature and degree of livelihood vulnerability to climate
   change among fishing households depend on their own characteristics and
   conditions as well as accessibility to livelihood diversification
   opportunities. Developing appropriate adaptation policies and coastal
   management measures to reduce livelihood vulnerability should enhance
   positive indicators of household's adaptive capacity and create a better
   environment for alternative livelihood opportunities.},

Title = {An Experimental Framework for Selectively Breeding Corals for Assisted
   Evolution},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Coral cover on tropical reefs has declined during the last three decades
   due to the combined effects of climate change, destructive fishing,
   pollution, and land use change. Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas
   emissions combined with effective coastal management and conservation
   strategies are essential to slow this decline. Innovative approaches,
   such as selective breeding for adaptive traits combined with large-scale
   sexual propagation, are being developed with the aim of pre-adapting
   reefs to increased ocean warming. However, there are still major gaps in
   our understanding of the technical and methodological constraints to
   producing corals for such restoration interventions. Here we propose a
   framework for selectively breeding corals and rearing them from eggs to
   2.5-year old colonies using the coral Acropora digitifera as a model
   species. We present methods for choosing colonies for selective
   crossing, enhancing early survivorship in ex situ and in situ nurseries,
   and outplanting and monitoring colonies on natal reefs. We used a
   short-term (7-day) temperature stress assay to select parental colonies
   based on heat tolerance of excised branches. From six parental colonies,
   we produced 12 distinct crosses, and compared survivorship and growth of
   colonies transferred to in situ nurseries or outplanted to the reef at
   different ages. We demonstrate that selectively breeding and rearing
   coral colonies is technically feasible at small scales and could be
   upscaled as part of restorative assisted evolution initiatives.
   Nonetheless, there are still challenges to overcome before selective
   breeding can be implemented as a viable conservation tool, especially at
   the post-settlement and outplanting phases. Although interdisciplinary
   approaches will be needed to overcome many of the challenges identified
   in this study, selective breeding has the potential to be a viable tool
   within a reef managers toolbox to support the persistence of selected
   reefs in the face of climate change.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities to marine climate
   change requires that communities have some intrinsic capacity to adapt.
   To assist adaptation planning and the implementation of adaptation
   strategies, identifying barriers and enablers to adaptation is
   important. Adaptive capacity, resource dependence, local climate change
   exposure and biological sensitivity were used to assess socioeconomic
   vulnerability to climate change in three Australian coastal communities:
   St Helens, Tasmania; Bowen, Queensland; and Geraldton, Western
   Australia. Higher adaptive capacity was associated with larger
   population size (i.e., Geraldton) whereas greater resource dependence,
   and lower human and natural capital were associated with smaller
   populations (St Helens and Bowen). Socioeconomic vulnerability was
   greatly influenced by climate exposure and sensitivity with the
   moderately sized Bowen having the highest socioeconomic vulnerability to
   climate change. Adaptation strategies that utilized available assets,
   improved adaptive capacity, or reduced socioeconomic vulnerability were
   identified in partnership with local communities, including increased
   and diversified employment opportunities, the re-establishment of local
   fish markets, and improved education and communication. The level of
   resources, or ``capitals,{''} available to communities can indicate
   where barriers and enablers to adaptation exist. Identified barriers to
   adaptation included a heavy reliance on one sector for employment and a
   lack of physical capital. We demonstrate that knowledge of intrinsic
   community characteristics can be beneficial for prioritizing adaptation
   actions to reduce socioeconomic vulnerability to marine climate change.},

Abstract = {Reducing vulnerability is the aim of flood risk management plans, yet
   their success depends on acceptance and implementation by their
   community. It is important, then, to study approaches that encourage
   societal participation in decision-making. The present study combined
   three participatory methods to capture and understand local knowledge on
   flood vulnerability reduction in a coastal town in southern Mexico. As a
   feasibility outcome, we found that these kinds of approaches involving
   community participation and consultation are attainable and easy to
   integrate into the local planning processes of vulnerability reduction
   and flood risk management. On process outcomes, we found that the
   community is aware of the flood risk given by their spatial location,
   has taken actions to adapt, and proposed other actions to reduce their
   vulnerability. We found no quantitative relationship between the levels
   of flood delimited by the participatory geographic information systems
   approach and the community's socioeconomic characteristics obtained by
   the house survey. Still, qualitative analysis of the three methods
   revealed that the collective memory of experiencing a flood plays a
   significant role in the measures the population takes to adapt and
   reduce vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Climate variability and change drive changes in marine ecosystems, such

   Mitigating measures in response to anthropogenic climate change are
   insufficient, and more attention must be directed toward adaptation to
   climate change. In the management of living marine resources, successful
   management will rest on the capacity of management regimes to be
   adaptive and flexible. This article addresses the management of living
   marine resources, and how management regimes cope with change and
   bolster the resilience of ecosystems. Experiences from the Norwegian
   management regime for living marine resources are used to illustrate how
   an existing regime can respond to change. We conclude that management
   regimes with sufficient capacity, in terms of robust science, regulatory
   frameworks that contribute to reduced fishing effort and maintenance of
   sustainable stock levels, and enforcement capability, are more likely to
   respond adequately to the challenges posed by climate change than those
   that do not.},

Abstract = {Local and global climate change increases the ambient temperature of
   cities by several degrees with important consequences on energy
   consumption, health and the economy. Advanced urban mitigation
   technologies contribute to decrease the ambient temperature and
   counterbalance the impact of urban heat islands. The present paper
   analyses and presents in a comparative way the mitigation potential of
   the known mitigation technologies using performance data from about 220
   real scale urban rehabilitation projects. The average and peak
   temperature drop of reflective technologies, greenery, evaporative
   systems, earth to air heat exchangers and their combinations is
   calculated and presented. The mitigation potential of the main systems
   like cool roofs, cool pavements, green roofs, urban trees, pools and
   ponds, sprinklers, fountains, and evaporative towers, is analysed. It is
   found that the potential of the main mitigation technologies is
   considerable and can counterbalance UHI effects partly or fully. The
   average peak temperature drop calculated for all projects is close to 2
   K, while the corresponding decrease of the average ambient temperature
   is close to 0.74 K. Almost 31\% of the analysed projects resulted in a
   peak temperature drop below 1 K, 62\% below 2 K, 82\% below 3 K and 90\%
   below 4 K. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Earth's atmosphere to reverse the global warming trend, has entered a
   working theory stage, finding expression in a variety of proposed
   projects, such as launching reflective materials into the Earth's
   atmosphere, positioning sunshades over the planet's surface, depositing
   iron filings into the oceans to encourage phytoplankton blooms, and
   planting more trees, to name only a few. However, geoengineering might
   not be as promising a solution to the problem of global warming as its
   advocates claim. Many scientists, policy makers, and ethicists still
   dismiss the option as infeasible and too risky given the immense scale
   at which most geoengineering projects must be instituted and the
   catastrophic consequences that could, in all likelihood, result. The
   thesis of this article is that geoengineering should not be so easily
   dismissed in policy debates concerning how to mitigate the anthropogenic
   emissions of global greenhouse gases. My plan is to investigate the
   desirability of the geoengineering option for addressing global climate
   change in terms of its capacity to overcome collective action issues, to
   accommodate ethical norms, and to provide an artful, or creative,
   response to the problem. In the first section, a general picture of the
   global warming problem and the particulars of some proposed
   geoengineering projects are laid out. The second section frames the
   issue as a collective action problem that demands an innovative approach
   to coordinating individual and group action. In the third section, I
   reveal six ethical quandaries that emerge in global climate change
   debates and how they complicate any attempts to ameliorate or resolve
   the problem. The penultimate section shows how the ideas and activism of
   two twentieth-century titans in philosophy and ecology-John Dewey and
   Aldo Leopold, respectively-might be combined to address the problem of
   global warming through artful inquiry and the adoption of an Earth
   ethic. Finally, I conclude by arguing that a fundamental shift in
   perspective must occur if we are to take intentional climate change
   seriously as a possible, even if a second-best, tool in the
   environmentalist's tool kit.},

Title = {Crisis in the wetlands: Combined stresses in a changing climate -
   Experience from Tanzania},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-15},
Abstract = {Climate variability and change has led to multifaceted stresses and
   compounded socio-environmental problems. Using the example of Simiyu
   wetlands in Tanzania, this article analyses the complexity and
   inter-connectedness of climate-related mal-adaptation and coping
   strategies and their implications. Various study methods were used,
   including consultative meetings, stakeholders workshops, a literature
   review, household questionnaires and land use cover and change analysis.
   Reactive coping and adaptation strategies have resulted in increased
   risks to livelihoods and the environment. Responses to climate
   variability and change in the study are complex, leading to amplified
   chain reactions. Extreme weather events, particularly droughts, have led
   people and herds of livestock to migrate into the wetlands.
   Environmental degradation is alarming. More than 42 per cent of natural
   vegetation in the study area has been wiped out in a span of 15 years.
   As a result, poor people whose livelihoods derive from the wetlands have
   suffered. The present institutional arrangements have failed to
   integrate the community's coping and adaptation strategies into wetlands
   management. Emerging conflicts among wetland users are intensifying
   environmental and community risks. This article emphasizes that, in a
   changing climate, wetlands need to be managed through flexible
   institutional and management frameworks that cross sectoral boundaries
   and involve all affected parties.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

Volume = {106},

Abstract = {Global environmental change and other site specific pressures (e.g. over
   fishing and pollution) are threating coral reefs and the livelihoods of
   dependent coastal communities. Multiple strategies are used to build the
   resilience of both coral reefs and reef dependent communities but the
   effectiveness of these strategies is largely unknown. Using the Western
   Indian Ocean (WIO) as a case study, this paper combines published
   literature and expert opinion elicited through a multi-stakeholder
   workshop to assess the intended and realised social and ecological
   implications of strategies commonly applied in the region. Findings
   suggest that all strategies can contribute to building social and
   ecological resilience, but this varies with context and the overall
   strategy objectives. The ability of strategies to be successful in the
   future is questioned. To support effective resilience policy development
   more nuanced lesson learning requires effective monitoring and
   evaluation as well as a disaggregated understanding of resilience in
   terms of gender, agency and the interaction between ecological and
   social resilience. Opportunities for further lesson sharing between
   experts in the region are needed.},

Title = {Farmers' adaptations strategies towards soil salinity effects in
   agriculture: the interior coast of Bangladesh},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {464-479},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {In this study, we critically analyze the general and climate-smart
   adaptation strategies used by farmers in four sub-districts in southern
   Bangladesh to address the effects of soil salinity in agriculture. Data
   were collected from 360 respondents using face-to-face interviews and
   were analyzed using multiple analyses (variance inflation factor,
   ordinary least squares, Tukey's post hoc test). The adaptations used by
   farmers to manage the impacts of soil salinity in agriculture were
   significantly influenced by their age, education, family size, farm
   size, level of contact with agricultural extension department officials,
   and their training experience. Farmers found adult education programmes
   particularly useful, since they focused on smart technique(s) rather
   than traditional approaches for agricultural development. Adaptation was
   comparatively more common in `early adapters' and `early majority'
   (slower to adapt) farmers. Our analysis suggests that climate-smart
   agriculture (CSA) programmes should be implemented in all affected
   sub-districts and similarly affected parts of the world. Extension
   workers should provide face-to-face demonstrations to affected farmers
   and support them with self-help programmes, which can help to attenuate
   and minimize the effects of soil salinity on agriculture. It will also
   be important to provide agricultural innovation support to affected
   farmers to cope with the adverse effects of soil salinity. Effective
   extension services are key to increasing farmers' access to innovative
   information and advice. Key policy insights A philosophy of `learning by
   viewing' for climate-smart agricultural innovations may encourage them
   to adopt adaptation strategies to minimize the impacts of soil salinity
   on agriculture. Training programmes could be offered to farmers by the
   Department of Agricultural Extension, especially to target innovators
   and early adopters of climate-smart practices, supporting them with a
   `self-help' approach. A motivational approach and good communication
   skills play a vital role when introducing new adaptation strategies. A
   climate-smart investment plan could identify policy opportunities to
   further develop agriculture actions to combat climate change. Building
   resilience to global climate change would help to sustainably increase
   agricultural productivity and incomes across farming communities.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes that there could be a future for dams, but only if
   they are made to be sustainable. It specifies ways to make hydropower
   and irrigation darns environmentally and socially sustainable. The main
   message is that while hydropower is far from perfect, its impacts are
   mitigable. The impacts of alternatives to hydropower, namely nuclear
   energy and coal, cannot be mitigated. The main means to approach
   sustainability is to integrate environmental and social criteria into
   traditional economic least-cost sequencing, which makes it Sectoral
   Environmental Assessment (SEA). Select more sustainable generation modes
   (e.g., demand-side management, hydro and other renewable resources)
   before less sustainable generation modes (e.g., coal, and nuclear
   energy). When the best mode and the best site (e.g., a hydro dam) have
   been selected then the normal project-level Environmental Assessment
   (EA) should be used to mitigate residual impacts, such as by lowering
   the dam or moving it upstream. While project-level EA is essential and
   needs to be strengthened, SEA to select the better projects is far more
   powerful. In addition, the energy sector needs to foster transparency
   and participation, substantially strengthen implementive capacity, show
   that conservation is well in hand and that electricity pricing is
   adequate before new capacity is contemplated. The biggest impact of
   dams, involuntary resettlement, needs the most attention. Oustees must
   be better off promptly after their move. Finally, the energy sector
   should play by the same economic rules; all sectoral subsidies should be
   revoked, and all power projects should internalise external
   environmental damage costs, including those of greenhouse gas emissions.
   To do less means the sectoral playing field is not level. This promotes
   coal and penalises hydro and other renewable resources: an
   environmentally retrogressive course.},

Abstract = {In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating how prepared
   California resource managers are for risks of continued climate change.
   The framework presented suggests three critical dimensions of
   preparedness - awareness of climate-related risks, analytic capacity to
   translate such climate risks information into specific planning and
   management activities, and the extent of actions taken to address the
   risks. We illustrate the application of this framework in this paper
   through preliminary research of California coastal managers where we
   identify limited awareness of climate-change related risks, limited
   analytic capacity, and significant constraints on the abilities of
   institutions and individuals to take adaptation actions. Our analysis
   suggests that for California to realize its significant adaptive
   capacity and be able to manage the unavoidable impacts of climate
   change, resource managers need to be engaged more effectively in future
   discussions of managing climate risks in the state.},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {2257-2276},

Abstract = {Adaptation has become the major approach to reduce the adverse effects
   of storm surge and sea-level rise. However, maladaptation can happen
   when adaptation actions unintentionally increase community
   vulnerability. To evaluate the adequacy and efficacy of adaptation
   policies under uncertain sea-level rise, this study presents an
   agent-based model by integrating the random nature of storm surges,
   private adaptation decisions, and real estate market valuation. We
   evaluated the evolving flood damage of different adaptation strategies
   under two bounding cases of real estate market change. Our model results
   quantitatively illustrate the accelerating damages of storm surges under
   climate-induced sea-level rise. A reform in flood insurance to
   risk-based rates with a means-tested voucher program and a
   government-subsidized ``twice and out{''} buyout program could both
   substantially improve coastal resilience. However, community adaptation
   with a public seawall may deliver false risk perception to high-risk
   property owners and result in maladaptation when sea-level rise rate is
   high. The modeling approach developed in this study can be used as a
   policy analysis tool to measure the impacts of sea-level rise and the
   effectiveness of adaptation strategies in coastal communities.},

Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) share a common vulnerability to
   climate change. Adaptation to climate change and variability is urgently
   needed yet, while some is already occurring in SIDS, research on the
   nature and efficacy of adaptation across SIDS is fragmentary. In this
   article, we systematically review academic literature to identify where
   adaptation in SIDS is documented; what type of adaptation strategies are
   taken, and in response to which climate change impacts; and the extent
   to which this adaptation has been judged as successful. Our analysis
   indicates that much adaptation research is concentrated on the Pacific,
   on independent island states, and on core areas within SIDS. Research
   documents a wide array of adaptation strategies across SIDS, notably
   structural or physical and behavioral changes. Yet, evaluation of
   concrete adaptation interventions is lacking; it thus remains unclear to
   what extent documented adaptation effectively and sustainably reduces
   SIDS' vulnerability and increases their resilience.},

Title = {The urgent case for stronger climate targets for international shipping},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-309},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {International shipping is overwhelmingly reliant on fossil fuels, with
   annual carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to a country the size of
   Germany. Actions to reduce its emissions are therefore an important
   element of global efforts to combat climate change. This article
   re-assesses the international shipping sector's initial greenhouse gas
   emissions reduction targets against the Paris Agreement goals. The
   analysis is based upon the latest data from the Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Maritime Organization (IMO)
   and uses the concept of carbon budgets to evaluate proportionate 1.5
   degrees C emissions pathways for the sector. The consequences of the
   resulting Paris-compliant pathways for shipping's existing mitigation
   targets and strategy are discussed. The article concludes that
   significantly stronger short- and longer-term targets need to be set for
   the sector to be compatible with the Paris Agreement's goals: 34\%
   reductions on 2008 emissions levels by 2030, and zero emissions before
   2050, compared with the sector's existing target of a 50\% cut in CO2 by
   2050. Crucially, strengthening the target by the IMO's strategy revision
   date of 2023 is imperative. The long asset lifetimes of ships and
   shipping infrastructure limit the speed of transition such that a delay
   of even a few years will dictate an untenable rate of decarbonization
   and increased risk of pushing the already challenging Paris goals out of
   reach.
   Key policy insights
   There is a gap between targets set out in the IMO's Initial Strategy and
   what is needed by the shipping sector to be Paris-compliant.
   Paris-compliant targets require a 34\% reduction in emissions by 2030,
   with zero emissions before 2050. Existing targets imply no absolute
   reduction in emissions to 2030, and only a 50\% reduction by 2050.
   The longer the delay in setting new targets, the steeper subsequent
   decarbonization trajectories become. Delay beyond 2023 would necessitate
   an untenably rapid transition, given long shipping asset lifetimes and
   global requirements for new land-side infrastructures, increasing the
   mitigation burden on other sectors.
   COP26 in November 2021 is an opportunity for the shipping sector to
   signal its intent to strengthen its targets, and to implement this in
   its 2023 strategy revision process, at the latest.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This case study examines the coastal hazard adaptation strategies of a
   fishing community in a village in Kerala, India. It shows that formal
   adaptation strategies are highly techno-centric, costly, and do not take
   into account the vulnerabilities of the fishing community. Instead, they
   have contributed to ecological, livelihood, and knowledge uncertainties.
   The adaptation strategies of the fishing community are a response to
   these uncertainties. However, they may not lead to the fishing
   community's recovery from its vulnerability contexts. This case study is
   primarily qualitative in nature. Data were collected through in-depth
   interviews. Insights reveal that when actors with diverse values,
   interests, knowledge, and power evolve or design their respective
   adaptation strategies, the resulting interface often aggravates existing
   uncertainties associated with hazards. Furthermore, the study
   demonstrates that local discourses on coastal hazards are
   livelihood-centric and socially constructed within the struggle of the
   fishing community to access resources and to acquire the right to
   development.},

   changes, impacts and risks associated with coastal change, especially

   options available for addressing resulting coastal flooding and erosion
   are evaluated. These are classified and compared across three potential
   adaptation strategies - (1) protect, (2) accommodate and (3) retreat -
   and considered from developed and developing country perspectives. It is
   emphasised that adaptation is an ongoing process which requires
   consideration and assessment of all drivers of risk, and monitoring of
   the risks and opportunities of the selected risk reduction measures, as
   well as review of their effectiveness. Further, adaptation needs to be
   integrated with wider coastal planning and management.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies to climatic variability: A case study of
   small-scale farmers in rural Mexico},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {533-540},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have major consequences for small-scale
   farmers in the developing rural areas of the world. Rural areas,
   nonetheless, harbor opportunities to mitigate global climate changes.
   Identification of innovative adaptation strategies used by small-scale
   farmers, therefore, is crucial in order to understand the extent of
   their implications. This paper identifies the relationships between
   livelihood units and landscapes that they depend upon, in a small-scale
   farm community. It examines their experiences of increasing climatic
   variability, and how the different groups in the community are adapting
   to it. The study was conducted in a typical rural ejido community on the
   Pacific coast of Mexico (Ejido Ticuiz), where a detailed socio-cultural
   profile was obtained by means of semi-structured interviews. In the
   study area we encountered a range of individual and community-based
   adaptation strategies, built on farmers' recognition of the different
   types of landscapes which supply goods and benefits. Small-scale farmers
   have used their landscape diversity to build adaptation strategies to
   guarantee the supply of goods and benefits to cope with uncertain of
   climate events. Households rather than individuals or the community as
   an institution were depicted as the core socio-cultural group for better
   understanding of patterns, behavior and aspirations related to climate
   change adaptation at local level. The adaptation capacities of rural
   communities could be significantly strengthened if political, financial
   and institutional support is targeted at households rather than at
   individuals or the community level only. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {212},
Number = {D},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bioenergy is a promising solution for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   mitigation. However, the emissions resulting from the different
   production stages must be quantified and evaluated. The life cycle
   assessment (LCA) method was used to compare and quantify the
   environmental burdens of three rice straw (RS) utilization scenarios for
   producing biogas, briquette fuel, and syngas. To our knowledge, this is
   the first study that applies the LCA approach to assess these three
   bioenergy scenarios in a single study where the main goal was to
   determine the most sustainable option. A total of 10 mid-point impact
   categories were investigated. The results indicated that the three
   scenarios achieved net positive energy and net negative GHG balances.
   The briquette fuel scenarios had the highest net energy balance (11,115
   MJ/tonne dry RS), while the syngas scenario had the highest net GHG
   (-2,315 kg CO2-eq./tonne dry RS). Moreover, the syngas scenario was the
   most beneficial to the environment, achieving negative results in 9 out
   of the 10 impact categories; the largest was marine ecotoxicity
   (-853,897 kg 1,4-DB-eq./tonne dry RS). The biogas scenario achieved
   emission savings in 3 out of the 10 categories. Although the briquette
   fuel scenario had no negative values in the 10 categories, its overall
   contribution to environmental burdens was relatively low. Overall, the
   order of the three scenarios in terms of the most sustainable option is
   syngas > briquette fuel > biogas.},

Abstract = {Tourism is an activity that is particularly exposed to the effects of
   climate change. Some tourist modalities (beach, winter sports, etc.){*}
   may show a high vulnerability to global warming and associated
   processes. Increased temperatures and reduced rainfall might generate a
   significant reduction in water resources in coastal Mediterranean areas.
   In this sense, the Spanish Mediterranean coast could become a laboratory
   for the analysis of the effects of the loss of water resources and their
   influence on tourism, which represents the main source of income in this
   part of Spain. This chapter analyses the different levels of exposure
   and vulnerability to climate change and the reduction of water resources
   in the tourist areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. It also
   analyses the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures to
   climate change (use of alternative water resources such as wastewater
   and desalination) that can prevent the loss of competitiveness for the
   tourism destinations in the forthcoming decades.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate change (CC) and consequent
   agricultural productivity repercussions. This study aimed at exploring
   the difference in farmers' perceptions of CC impacts on crop production
   and variation in adaptation measures across the Ganges' Tidal Floodplain
   (GTF) region. To unlock the local level context-specific nature of
   adaptation, the study area covered two distinct zones of the GTF:
   interior zone, surrounded by the Sundarbans mangrove forest, and
   exterior zone being more exposed to the Bay of Bengal. An analysis of
   the differences in empirical climate parameter trends and farmers'
   adaptations to adjust to these changes in the two sample study areas
   (one from each zone) was conducted. In the exterior zone (Patuakhali),
   delayed monsoon and increasing intensity of post-monsoon rainfall
   coupled with poor water drainage resulted in delayed winter vegetable
   production and late harvest of rainy season rice (aman), eventually
   leading to a loss of winter rice season (boro). Rainfall in the interior
   zone (Satkhira) was found erratic and unevenly distributed causing
   unexpected loss of harvest. Farmers in both areas reported a high impact
   of CC on crop production. Farmers reported optimisation of fertiliser
   and pesticide use and planting date adjustment as the most practiced
   adaptations in both areas. Other preferred adaptation options were
   rice-fish farming in Satkhira and growing of high-value cash crops in
   Patuakhali. In terms of weighted average index scoring, Satkhira farmers
   on average had medium adaptation scores, while most of Patuakhali
   farmers had medium to low adaptation scores. Living in the same
   agroecological zone, the difference in farmers' perceptions, climate
   variability, and adaptation practices call for context- and
   location-specific adaptation planning and policy.},

Abstract = {The CalNex 2010 (California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and
   Climate Change) study was designed to evaluate the chemical composition
   of air masses over key source regions in California. During May to June
   2010, air samples were collected on board a National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D aircraft over the South Coast
   Air Basin of California (SoCAB) and the Central Valley (CV). This paper
   analyzes six effective greenhouse gases-chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22),
   1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b), 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane
   (HCFC-142b), 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124),
   1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a), and 1,1-difluoroethane
   (HFC-152a)-providing the most comprehensive characterization of
   chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement compound emissions in California.
   Concentrations of measured HCFCs and HFCs are enhanced greatly
   throughout the SoCAB and CV, with highest levels observed in the SoCAB:
   310 +/- 92 pptv for HCFC-22, 30.7 +/- 18.6 pptv for HCFC-141b, 22.9 +/-
   2.0 pptv for HCFC-142b, 4.86 +/- 2.56 pptv for HCFC-124, 109 +/- 46.4
   pptv for HFC-134a, and 91.2 +/- 63.9 pptv for HFC-152a. Annual emission
   rates are estimated for all six compounds in the SoCAB using the
   measured halocarbon to carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios and CO
   emissions inventories. Emission rates of 3.05 +/- 0.70 Gg for HCFC-22,
   0.27 +/- 0.07 Gg for HCFC-141b, 0.06 +/- 0.01 Gg for HCFC-142b, 0.11 +/-
   0.03 Gg for HCFC-124, 1.89 +/- 0.43 Gg for HFC-134a, and 1.94 +/- 0.45
   Gg for HFC-152b for the year 2010 are calculated for the SoCAB. These
   emissions are extrapolated from the SoCAB region to the state of
   California using population data. Results from this study provide a
   baseline emission rate that will help future studies determine if HCFC
   and HFC mitigation strategies are successful. Citation: Barletta, B., et

Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},

Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {All sectors face decarbonization for a 2 degrees C temperature increase
   to be avoided. Nevertheless, meaningful policy measures that address
   rising CO2 from international aviation and shipping remain woefully
   inadequate. Treated with a similar approach within the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), they are often debated
   as if facing comparable challenges, and even influence each others'
   mitigation policies. Yet their strengths and weaknesses have important
   distinctions. This article sheds light on these differences so that they
   can be built upon to improve the quality of debate and ensuing policy
   development. The article quantifies 2 degrees C' pathways for these
   sectors, highlighting the need for mitigation measures to be urgently
   accelerated. It reviews recent developments, drawing attention to one
   example where a change in aviation mitigation policy had a direct impact
   on measures to cut CO2 from shipping. Finally, the article contrasts
   opportunities and barriers towards mitigation. The article concludes
   that there is a portfolio of opportunities for short- to medium-term
   decarbonization for shipping, but its complexity is its greatest barrier
   to change. In contrast, the more simply structured aviation sector is
   pinning too much hope on emissions trading to deliver CO2 cuts in line
   with 2 degrees C. Instead, the solution remains controversial and
   unpopular - avoiding 2 degrees C requires demand management.Policy
   relevanceThe governance arrangements around the CO2 produced by
   international aviation and shipping are different from other sectors
   because their emissions are released in international airspace and
   waters. Instead, through the Kyoto Protocol, the International Civil
   Aviation Authority (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization
   (IMO) were charged with developing policies towards mitigating their
   emissions. Slow progress to date, coupled with strong connections with
   rapidly growing economies, has led to the CO2 from international
   transport growing at a higher rate than the average rate from all other
   sectors. This article considers this rapid growth, and the potential for
   future CO2 growth in the context of avoiding a 2 degrees C temperature
   rise above pre-industrial levels. It explores similarities and
   differences between these two sectors, highlighting that a reliance on
   global market-based measures to deliver required CO2 cuts will likely
   leave both at odds with the overarching climate goal.},

Title = {Modeling coastal flood risk and adaptation response under future climate
   conditions},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {The National Coastal Property Model (NCPM) simulates flood damages
   resulting from sea level rise and storm surge along the contiguous U.S.
   coastline. The model also projects local-level investments in a set of
   adaptation measures under the assumption that these measures will be
   adopted when benefits exceed the costs over a 30-year period. However,
   it has been observed that individuals and communities often underinvest
   in adaptive measures relative to standard cost-benefit assumptions due
   to financial, psychological, sociopolitical, and technological factors.
   This study applies an updated version of the NCPM to incorporate
   improved cost-benefit tests and to approximate observed sub-optimal
   flood risk reduction behavior. The updated NCPM is tested for two
   multi-county sites: Virginia Beach, VA and Tampa, FL. Sub-optimal
   adaptation approaches slow the implementation of adaptation measures
   throughout the 100-year simulation and they increase the amount of flood
   damages, especially early in the simulation. The net effect is an
   increase in total present value cost of \$1.1 to \$1.3 billion (2015
   USD), representing about a 10\% increase compared to optimal adaptation
   approaches. Future calibrations against historical data and
   incorporation of non-economic factors driving adaptation decisions could
   prove useful in better understanding the impacts of continued
   sub-optimal behavior.},

Title = {Prioritization of Climate Change Adaptation Interventions in a Road
   Network combining Spatial Socio-Economic Data, Network Criticality

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},

Volume = {2672},

Abstract = {Climate change puts at risk all current and future transport projects.
   Investing proactively in climate adaptation of transport infrastructure
   is paramount to providing resilience and sustainable transport systems
   that may promote social and economic growth. Despite the importance of
   such investments, the financial resources of many road administrations
   are constrained, creating an urgent need to allocate these resources
   efficiently to capture the highest social, environmental, and economic
   benefits. This paper aims to tackle this issue by presenting a
   methodology to prioritize climate change adaptation interventions based
   on a set of economic, social, and risk reduction criteria. This method
   uses a network-wide approach to the road system in order to capture
   co-benefits, redundancies, and costs of disruption of road segments due
   to flood events. All underlying data in each of the criteria is part of
   a geospatial database that includes the location of agriculture, fishery
   production areas, high poverty, and flood maps. The methodology was
   developed at the request of the World Bank Africa Team to support the
   Government of Mozambique to prioritize climate change adaptation
   intervention in two central provinces, Zambezia and Nampula. After
   combining criteria for agriculture, fishery, poverty, network
   criticality, and hazard risk, the results suggest that most roads in the
   coastal districts of these provinces could be identified as top priority
   for climate change adaptation interventions.},

Title = {Understanding climate change policy and action in Portuguese
   municipalities: A survey},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {68-78},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Robust strategies and action-plans are essential in tackling climate
   change. Given the local and context specific nature of climate impacts,
   the involvement of municipalities is key for effective mitigation and
   adaptation solutions. Due to its vulnerability and low level of adaptive
   capacity, Portugal offers insights into adaptation research and practice
   in Europe. This article hypothesizes that National and European climate
   change adaptation strategies are not effectively involving
   municipalities, and are thus losing out on the opportunity to take stock
   of local responses for climate change mitigation and adaptation. To
   address this issue, a survey by questionnaire was done to Portuguese
   municipalities, and data was collected regarding the following: the
   importance attributed to climate change; the mitigation and adaptation
   measures planned and implemented; the main drivers, concerns, and
   triggers promoting climate policy and actions; and access to information
   and knowledge. 109 valid responses were collected across the country
   from a universe of 308 municipalities. Results show climate change in
   planning agendas is still `little' or `not important'. There is also a
   clear difference in the drivers and concerns motivating climate policy,
   and action between Littoral and Inland regions. Overall, there is a
   greater focus on mitigation than adaptation. The discussion highlights
   the need for capacity building, the issue of equity, the role of
   European networks, and the relevance of cultural differences between
   Littoral and Inland regions. The conclusion distils the main lessons
   learned concerning these challenges and needs, the role of transnational
   networks, and the cultural contexts for building resilience, through
   adaptation, across Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be stored in geological formations beneath the
   UK continental shelf (UKCS) as a greenhouse gas mitigation option. It
   can be trapped in subsurface reservoirs in structural or stratigraphic
   traps beneath cap rocks, as a residual CO2 saturation in pore spaces
   along the CO2 migration path within the reservoir rock, by dissolution
   into the native pore fluid (most commonly brine), by reaction of
   acidified groundwater with mineral components of the reservoir rock, or
   by adsorption onto surfaces within the reservoir rock, e.g. onto the
   carbonaceous macerals that are the principal components of coal.
   Estimates of the CO2 storage capacity of oil and gas fields on the UKCS
   suggest that they could store between 1200 and 3500 x 10(6) t of CO2 and
   up to 6100 x 10(6) t CO2, respectively. Estimating the regional CO2
   storage potential of saline water-bearing sedimentary rocks is
   resource-intensive and no UK estimates have yet taken into account all
   the factors that should be considered. Existing studies estimate the
   pore volume and the likely CO2 saturation in the closed structures in a
   potential reservoir formation but do not take account of the potentially
   limiting regional pressure rise likely to occur as a result of the very
   large-scale CO2 injection that would be necessary to make an impact on
   national emissions. There is undoubtedly great storage potential in the
   saline water-bearing reservoir rocks of the basins around the UK, but
   the real challenge for studies of aquifer CO2 storage capacity in the UK
   is perhaps not to estimate the total theoretical CO2 storage capacity as
   this is not a particularly meaningful number. Rather it is to thoroughly
   investigate selected reservoirs perceived to have good storage potential
   to a standard where there is scientific consensus that the resulting
   storage capacity estimates are realistic. This will allow it to be
   considered as closer to the status of a reserve rather than a resource
   and will help define the scope for CO2 capture and storage in the UK.},

Abstract = {The present work aims at presenting an approach for implementing
   appropriate mitigation measures for upgrading of rubble-mound
   breakwaters to face the increasing marine hazards and the increasing
   exposure to downtime risks, based on reliability analysis of the studied
   structure coupled with economic optimization techniques. The approach
   includes the construction of probability distribution functions for all
   the stochastic variables of the marine climate for present and future
   conditions, the suggestion of different mitigation options for
   upgrading, the construction of a fault tree providing a logical
   succession of all events that lead to port downtime for each alternative
   mitigation option and the testing of a large number of possible
   alternative geometries for each option. From the total sample of
   acceptable geometries for each upgrading option, a single solution is
   selected minimizing the total costs of protection. The methodology is
   applied to a simplified form of the rubble-mound breakwater of the port
   of Deauville, in France. For the studied breakwater, the construction of
   a berm in front of the existing structure seems to be advantageous in
   terms of optimized total costs compared to the other mitigation options.},

Abstract = {Climate change-induced sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, sudden water
   surge, natural calamities, etc. affect the fish biodiversity, food
   security, and coastal livelihoods that highlight the necessities of
   developing climate-resilient strategies e.g. adaptive aquaculture
   techniques. Cage culture of salinity-tolerant fish may be an adaptation
   strategy to compensate for the losses of freshwater fish production by
   climate change in coastal areas. Therefore, a 120-day long field
   experiment was conducted to evaluate the cage culture potentiality of
   Mystus gulio in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Three treatments at
   the stocking density of 90 (T-1), 135 (T-2), and 180 (T-3)/m(2) were
   stocked in nine cages (1.115 m(2)). Significantly (p<0.05) higher growth
   performance and feed utilization were recorded in T-1 followed by T-2
   and T-3. In return, considering overall growth, survival, production,
   coast-benefit analysis, T-2 was found more profitable followed by T-3
   and T-1. This result revealed that the culture of M. gulio in floating
   net cages might be a potential climate-adaptive aquaculture technique in
   the coastal region. However, further research works are necessary for
   optimizing stocking density, nutrition, social acceptance, etc. before
   conclude it as a viable climate-resilient adaptive aquaculture practice.},

Abstract = {In late December 2007 and early January 2008, more than 100 people have
   been killed and hundreds of thousands have been affected in East and
   Central Java Provinces by the flooding and landslides, which began on
   December 25, 2007. During that time, persistent heavy rains led to
   overflowing rivers, flooding and landslides throughout Indonesia,
   resulting in numerous fatalities and crop losses. The two largest river
   basins in Java Island i. e. Bengawan Solo and Brantas River basins, were
   the hardest hit on the basins from flooding and landslides. Based on
   Multi satellite Precipitation Analysis (MPA) produced at NASA's Goddard
   Space Flight Center for December 24, 2007 to January 2, 2008, the
   highest rainfall totals for the period were over 250 millimeters (about
   10 inches). Although the highest amounts were over water, parts of Java
   received in excess of 6 to 8 inches. Deforestation in the region may
   have contributed to the devastating mudslides. The latest flooding in
   Bengawan Solo River basin occurred four times in January to March 2009,
   caused economic disturbances in the region with economic losses
   estimated of about Rp. 1, 000 billion. In the future, increased
   precipitation intensity and variability in the basin due to climate
   change are projected to increase the risks of flooding. The flood
   magnitude and frequency in the basins have increased significantly and
   become significant issue in the basin's water resources management. To
   cope with flood hazards that happen frequently in the Bengawan Solo
   River basin, some mitigation and adaptation measures had been done and
   still need to be done in the basins, involving Central Government,
   Provincial Government, Regency/Municipality Government, communities,
   NGOs, etc. This paper will discuss the impact of climate change on
   increasing flood magnitude and frequency, taking into account flooding
   occurrences in the Bengawan Solo River basin, Indonesia and its
   mitigation and adaptation measures.},

Title = {A CRITICAL REVIEW OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION
   IN CITIES},
Journal = {CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study systematically reviews the scientific literature (n = 56) on
   cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of adaptation measures in cities and similar
   urban environments. The review is conducted to assess existing or
   proposed actions for dealing with impacts of drought, heat waves,
   sea-level rise, and pluvial and fluvial flooding. It includes over 30
   measures related to structural, services, technological, informational
   and ecosystem-based approaches. The main findings demonstrate that CBA
   of adaptation measures across urban environments must contend with
   numerous long-term socioeconomic and climate change uncertainties.
   Subsequently, this has led to inconsistencies in valuation frameworks
   related to, for example, planning horizons, discount rates, non-market
   considerations and future scenarios. Results also indicate a clear gap
   in the literature on the economic valuation of adaptation measures in
   the Global South. Furthermore, few studies integrate equity dimensions
   while planning for adaptation. Extensions of CBA to account for key
   uncertainties will help policy makers to allocate (often scarce)
   resources more efficiently and limit the likelihood of maladaptation.
   Further inclusion of the magnitude and distributional effects of
   non-market impacts and greater civil society engagement in policy
   dialogues will also be vital for promoting just and equitable measures
   that balance adaptation alongside other policy goals such as mitigation,
   economic development, health and well-being.},

Title = {Impacts on the marine environment from direct and indirect ocean storage
   of CO2},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {323-327},
Abstract = {The potential effects of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel energy
   production, large industries and changes in land use on climate change
   is an area of research requiring and receiving massive global efforts.
   Possible impacts of climate change and variability on marine life have
   received some attention, mainly regarding changes in living conditions
   via changes in water temperature, wind and waves and other physical
   climate related forcing of the marine environment. There is also a
   chemical forcing of the marine environment caused by CO2 emissions to
   the atmosphere penetrating into the oceans. The perturbation of the
   marine environment through such indirect, i.e. via the atmosphere,
   storage of CO2 in the oceans may be estimated based on known and
   predicted atmospheric CO2 levels. Capture of CO2 from the flue gas of
   power plants and large industries followed by storage directly in the
   oceans may be a necessary component of a greenhouse gas mitigation
   strategy for the next century in order to achieve a stabilization of
   atmospheric CO2 levels. Direct storage of CO2 in the oceans may impose,
   at least locally, a stronger perturbation of the marine environment than
   indirect storage via the atmosphere. Storage of waste CO2 in aquifers
   below the seabed may also affect the marine environment if CO2 leaks out
   in the water column above. In view of the perturbations of the marine
   environment that are already ongoing as a consequence of CO2 emissions
   to the atmosphere and which will accelerate in the business-as-usual
   scenario as well as in scenarios including realistic CO2 removal
   options, there is a need to clarify the resilience of marine ecosystems
   to increased CO2. This paper discusses the large perturbations that are
   expected in various scenarios. One hypothesis is that direct ocean
   storage if performed in the most environment-friendly way map be
   acceptable, while continued emissions to the atmosphere and invasion
   across the air-sea-interface could lead not only to climate change but
   could also be harmful to marine food webs and ecosystem functions. Some
   experimental approaches that may be taken in order to contribute to a
   wider knowledge base for CO2 policies are briefly described. (C) 1998

Title = {Mix design and benefit evaluation of high solar reflectance concrete for
   pavements},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2007},
Number = {2011},
Pages = {11-20},
Abstract = {The use of cool paving materials, or cool pavements, has been identified
   as one strategy that can help mitigate the urban ``heat island{''}
   effect. One method of creating a cool pavement is to increase the solar
   reflectance, or albedo, of its surface. This increase can be achieved by
   many existing paving technologies. This study explores alternative ways
   of creating high-albedo concrete for use in pavement applications. The
   key approach is to make concrete whiter by replacing cement with whiter
   constituents. Fly ash and slag are used as the main constituents because
   they are environmentally friendly, readily available, and already
   familiar to the concrete industry. Compared with a conventional concrete
   mix, concrete mixes containing fly ash have lower albedo, whereas
   concrete mixes containing slag have higher albedo. Of all mixes tested,
   the mix with 70\% slag as cement replacement achieves the highest albedo
   of 0.582, which is 71\% higher than the conventional mix. It also has
   better compressive strength as tested at 7 and 28 days and modulus of
   rupture as tested at 7 days. The production of high solar reflectance
   concrete consumes 43.5\% less energy and results in less emission of
   pollutants and greenhouse gases (by 20\% to 60\%). Furthermore, the
   analysis of some urban cities shows that the implementation of this high
   solar reflectance concrete could increase the city albedo by 0.02 to
   0.07. This amount of albedo modification has the potential to benefit
   economics and the environment in many ways, ranging from decreasing
   energy demand to improving air quality.},

Title = {Optimisation of Ultrasound Pretreatment of Microalgal Biomass for
   Effective Biogas Production through Anaerobic Digestion Process},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The anaerobic digestion, AD, process presents a solution for sustainable
   waste management, greenhouse gas mitigation and energy production for
   growing population needs and requirements. Adopting a biorefinery
   approach that utilises different feedstock may enhance energy production
   and support optimisation of the anaerobic digestion process. Algae is a
   promising feedstock that could be used for energy production via the
   anaerobic digestion process. Microalgal biomass is rich in carbohydrates
   and lipids; however, many species of algae exhibit tough cell walls that
   could also be difficult to digest and may influence or inhibit the
   efficiency of the AD process. This study concentrated on the comparison
   of AD remediation of two marine algal biomass species, Tetraselmis
   suecica and Nannochloropsis oceanica. The two species were pre-treated
   with an ultrasound technique and compared for their methane production
   using biochemical methane potential tests. For Tetraselmis, a specific
   methane production of 0.165 LCH4/KgVS was observed; however, for
   Nannochloropsis, a value of 0.101 LCH4/KgVS was observed for the samples
   treated with ultrasound. The BMP results from this study show that among
   the two micro-algae species tested, Tetraselmis suecica is found to be a
   better substrate for methane production potential. Contrary to
   increasing the specific methane production, ultrasound cavitation caused
   a slight decrease in the specific methane production values for both
   Nannochloropsis oceanica and Tetraselmis suecica biomass residues. The
   pre-treatment of the biomass using ultrasound techniques provided
   comparable results and can be recommended for effective bioenergy
   production. However, further research is required for the optimisation
   of the pre-treatment of microalgae and for the integration of microalgal
   biorefineries for circular economy.},

Title = {Uncovering Engagement Networks for Adaptation in Three Regional
   Communities: Empirical Examples from New South Wales, Australia},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change is a significant challenge for policy makers, planners
   and communities. While adaptation responses are generally recognised to
   be place-based, policy processes on adaptation often reside with central
   (state or national) governments that may be remote from regional
   communities. In this paper, we contribute to the literature regarding
   how diverse regional communities engage with planning and policy for
   climate adaptation, which is important for successful implementation. We
   adopt a social network analysis (SNA) approach that enables an
   exploration of the interaction of community networks with policy
   information. There are limited empirical studies of information sharing
   about climate adaptation policy through community knowledge networks.
   One previous study, located in coastal New South Wales, Australia,
   mapped the community's knowledge acquisition and diffusion to reveal the
   underlying network structures that influenced policy engagement
   pathways. However, further studies are needed to determine how the
   features of community networks may change with local context (e.g.,
   coastal versus inland). This paper extends previous studies to compare
   and contrast adaptation knowledge networks in three NSW communities:
   Shoalhaven (the original coastal study site), Bega (coastal) and Orange
   (inland). Findings suggest that the presence of a natural
   resource-dependent industry, local geographies and boundary spanners
   acting as network knowledge brokers are factors influencing community
   knowledge flows. The work further demonstrates the utility of SNA to
   measure knowledge networks that can inform government engagement and
   communication with communities on climate adaptation policy.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rising temperatures due to climate change and urban heat island effects
   lead to heat stress and need remedial actions at all city planning
   scales. The design of built spaces strongly influences residents'
   exposure to heat risks. However, practices that increase communities'
   resilience to heat are not yet influencing decision-making in urban
   planning. In this study, qualitative interviews were conducted in
   low-income households in three different cities in India and Austria to
   understand residents' strategies for coping with excess summer heat in
   their homes. Although significant differences are discernible between
   India and Austria, low-income households in both continents lack agency
   over their housing situation and have little means to adapt it to heat.
   This lack strongly influences how they can handle the heat. Lack of
   resources forces them to accept unfavourable thermal conditions and
   keeps them from affording any but the most basic remedies. While
   buildings constitute the single most important and effective means of
   protection against heat stress for most interviewees in India, design
   restrictions and the appliance of cheap building materials limit this
   protection's effectiveness, especially during evening and night times.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of scientific uncertainty and the
   way it impedes planning for climate change and accelerated sea-level
   rise (CC \& ASLR) in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). The paper begins
   by discussing the problems CC \& ASLR poses for PICs, and it explores
   the limitations of the dominant approach to vulnerability and
   adaptation. Next, the paper considers the way scientific uncertainty
   problematizes policies aimed at adaptation to CC \& ASLR. It argues that
   the prevailing approach, which requires anticipation of impacts, is
   unsuccessful, and the paper proposes a complementary strategy aimed to
   enhance the resilience of whole island social-ecological systems. Recent
   developments in the theory and practice of resilience are discussed and
   then applied to formulate goals for adaptation policy in PICs. (C) 2001

Title = {An innovative climate adaptation planning process: iDEAL project},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {317},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Climate change triggers increasing stresses on urban settlements and
   coastal areas. The intensification of climate-connected impacts requires
   municipalities and communities to undertake adaptation measures and
   plans. These interventions should be capable of reducing negative
   climatic effects on human habitat and regional bioregions. On the one
   hand, the international scientific community recognized the supported
   adaptation planning approach as the more suitable to cope with local
   needs and criticalities. On the other hand, there is a lack of practical
   guidelines and examples that can be used to implement the theory. From a
   perspective of growth of global awareness and sensitivity to the
   climatic emergency, it is necessary to develop a practical methodology
   able to link together impacts perception and public decision process at
   the local scale. The paper aims to fill the gap between the theoretical
   approach and the practice, through a replicable experience of
   integration among climate change adaptation concepts and decision-making
   processes. The proposed methodology is described in a 4-step process to
   support decision-makers in selecting tailored adaptation policies and
   measures. The article is based on the experience developed within the
   Interreg It-Hr project ``iDEAL - Decision support for Adaptation
   pLan{''} project. The research combines a quantitative and qualitative
   methodology in local participation processes. The approach is tested on
   five Mediterranean coastal cities and allowed to support the development
   of tailored adaptation measures. Furthermore, the interaction with local
   actors during the process led to an acceptance of the implemented
   measures, designing each measure to stakeholders' ambitions and
   expectations.},

Abstract = {Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the first, but temporary,
   substitution products for the strong ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons
   (CFCs). HCFC consumption and production are currently regulated under
   the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and
   their emissions have started to stabilize or even decrease. As HCFC-22
   (CHClF2) is by far the most abundant HCFC in today's atmosphere, it is
   crucial to continue to monitor the evolution of its atmospheric
   concentration. In this study, we describe an improved HCFC-22 retrieval
   strategy from ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) solar spectra recorded at the high-altitude scientific station of
   Jungfraujoch, the Swiss Alps, 3580 m a.m.s.l. (above mean sea level).
   This new strategy distinguishes tropospheric and lower-stratospheric
   partial columns. Comparisons with independent datasets, such as the
   Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and the Michelson
   Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), supported by
   models, such as the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObErvation
   (BASCOE) and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM),
   demonstrate the validity of our tropospheric and lower-stratospheric
   long-term time series. A trend analysis on the datasets used here, now
   spanning 30 years, confirms the last decade's decline in the HCFC-22
   growth rate. This updated retrieval strategy can be adapted for other
   ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), such as CFC-12. Measuring or
   retrieving ODS atmospheric concentrations is essential for scrutinizing
   the fulfilment of the globally ratified Montreal Protocol.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {23-37},
Abstract = {Climate Change (CC) is universally recognized as a major global threat
   due to its nature of impacts. Island nations are known to be the most
   vulnerable to CC impacts where many countries have initiated mitigation
   and adaptation actions through sector-based policy measures. Singapore
   and Sri Lanka are two Asian island nations with CC induced threats. Two
   countries are different in terms of economic development, but similar
   developing countries in the CC agenda. In this context, both the
   countries have initiated mitigation and adaptation actions through
   policy measures. This study compares the key climate driven performance
   indicators with historical data to evaluate the performance of climate
   change policy of each country. Generally, policy evaluation has been
   conducted by adopting scientific and non-scientific tools, but it is
   seldom see that the relation of climate driven indicators along with CC
   policy. Also the policy research was mostly based on European case
   studies and Asian island nations were not easy to find in this context.
   The comparison of two countries in terms of CC policy is to determine
   the key vulnerable sectors where intervention is necessary for island
   nations. Mitigation policies are evaluated in Singapore and Sri Lanka
   using GHG emission pathways under twelve (12) indicators and adaptation
   policies are measured under the national expenditure of key sectors of
   the economy under seven (07) indicators. The analysis further elaborated
   by comparing both countries with key economic sectors that has positive
   and negative influence on CC impacts. Finally, the analysis outcome is
   used for lessons to learn from each other in improving the CC policy of
   Singapore and Sri Lanka. As every country has a unique set of strategies
   to minimize contributions to CC impacts, unique features that are common
   to both countries are chosen as variables for the comparison. Policy
   recommendations are provided to implement solid action plan for post
   2020. The study expects to assist island countries to strengthen the CC
   policy as a national priority to manage unforeseen impacts posed by CC
   phenomena. (C) 2019 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Salinity as a slow onset climate change induced disaster is affecting

   conducted a survey with 318 landless people, 195 women and 123 men,
   selected purposively from two southwest coastal villages of Bangladesh.
   A five-point ordinal level Likert scale has been used to analyse data.
   Change in land use pattern, use of modern technology in agriculture,
   diversification of crops and income sources, using savings and
   harvesting rainwater were some of the adaptation strategies common in
   the study areas. The study found that women's ability to adapt is
   seriously compromised by their limited access to capital. So it is vital
   that the government take up specific programmes to enhance their
   adaptation capacity through increasing income generating activities and

Abstract = {Within this work, the impact of mitigation measures and infiltration on
   flash floods is investigated by using a 2D robust shallow water model

   effectiveness of bypass channels in addition to retention basins.
   Retention basins at appropriate locations could reduce the maximum water
   depth at critical locations by 23\%, while the additional implementation
   of drainage channels lead to a reduction of 75\%, considering also
   infiltration lead to a further reduction of 97\%. If infiltration was
   considered without mitigation measures, the peak water depth was reduced
   by 67\%. For an exceptional extreme event the measures lead to a
   reduction of 73\% at some locations, while at other locations the
   overflow from retention basins due to overstraining generated even
   higher inundations with an increase of 58\%.},

   productivity in South Africa, with the Western Cape Province among the
   most affected areas. Smallholder farmers usually suffer the most due to
   limited resources. The study identified agricultural water use coping
   and adaptation strategies adopted by both crop and livestock smallholder
   farmers in the West Coast and Overberg districts during the recent
   2015-2018 drought. Interviews were conducted with 100 smallholder
   farmers and 11 focus group discussions were held in the two districts.
   Quantitative data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social
   Sciences, while qualitative data were analysed using Atlas.ti.
   Furthermore, the Hyogo Framework of Action was used to analyse the
   support that smallholder farmers had received and to understand how
   smallholder farmers could be effectively supported to promote the
   adoption of proactive strategies to deal with drought in the short and
   long term. It was found that the 2015-2018 drought occurred when
   smallholder farmers from both districts were least expecting it and were
   unprepared. In the West Coast District, the main coping strategies
   included using borehole water and selling livestock. In the Overberg
   District, smallholder farmers coped by purchasing fodder and
   transporting water from sources such as the river and dam to the farms.
   Several smallholder farmers in both districts did not implement any
   adaptation strategies. They were largely unaware of proactive
   agricultural water use strategies that could bolster their resilience to
   drought. Recommendations for the future include the adoption of drip
   irrigation, mulching, growing vegetables with shorter growing periods
   and changing planting dates. For livestock farmers, adaptation
   strategies include drilling boreholes and grazing management. There is
   also a need for early warning systems to improve the drought
   preparedness of smallholder farmers.},

Abstract = {Adaptive management of natural resources is an iterative process of
   decision making whereby management strategies are progressively changed
   or adjusted in response to new information. Despite an increasing focus
   on the need for adaptive conservation strategies, there remain few
   applied examples. We describe the 9-year process of adaptive
   comanagement of a marine protected area network in Kubulau District,
   Fiji. In 2011, a review of protected area boundaries and management
   rules was motivated by the need to enhance management effectiveness and
   the desire to improve resilience to climate change. Through a series of
   consultations, with the Wildlife Conservation Society providing
   scientific input to community decision making, the network of marine
   protected areas was reconfigured so as to maximize resilience and
   compliance. Factors identified as contributing to this outcome include
   well-defined resource-access rights; community respect for a flexible
   system of customary governance; long-term commitment and presence of
   comanagement partners; supportive policy environment for comanagement;
   synthesis of traditional management approaches with systematic
   monitoring; and district-wide coordination, which provided a broader
   spatial context for adaptive-management decision making.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {A changing climate and higher wind speeds means that residential
   construction is likely to receive more damage in the future if design
   standards are maintained at the current level. The vulnerability of
   residential construction may be reduced by an adaptation strategy that
   increases design wind speeds specified by Australian standards. The
   paper applies break-even analysis to compare the risks, costs and
   benefits of climate adaptation strategies for new housing in the three
   largest cities in Australia: Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. These
   cities are located in southeast Australia where wind hazard is dominated
   by synoptic winds (thunderstorms and east-coast lows). Break-even
   estimates of risk reduction and adaptation cost for designing new
   housing to enhanced standards were calculated for three synoptic wind
   pattern scenarios to 2070: (1) no change, (2) B1 and (3) A1FI emission
   scenarios. If the actual cost of adaptation exceeds the predicted
   break-even value, then adaptation is not cost-effective. It was found
   that this adaptation strategy can lead to risk reductions of 50-80 \% at
   a cost of approximately 1 \% of house replacement value. If risk
   reduction is over 50 \%, discount rate is 4 \%, and there is no change
   of climate, the break-even analysis shows that adaptation is
   cost-effective for Sydney if the adaptation cost is less than 5-9 \% of
   house replacement cost. Designing new housing to enhance wind
   classifications is also likely to be a cost-effective adaptation
   strategy for Brisbane and Melbourne.},

Abstract = {The oil and gas exploration and production sector are one of the most
   significant methane emitters through fossil fuel combustion and fugitive
   emissions. In Brazil, there are few studies focused on the mitigation of
   methane in the oil sector. The objective of the present work is to use a
   multicriteria analysis methodology to compare different methane
   mitigation technologies applicable to offshore oil and gas platforms. In
   the study, six different mitigation options were compared through the
   analytic hierarchy process methodology, considering environmental,
   financial and operational criteria. The results were calculated for each
   mitigation option considering the scores of each criterion and their
   respective relative weights, obtained in the prioritization of the
   elements. This unique score obtained through the analytic hierarchy
   process made it possible to compare the mitigation alternatives. The
   alternative that received the best score considering the evaluated
   criteria was the recovery of vapor from cargo tanks associated with
   methane reuse, being highlighted mainly due to its high potential for
   mitigation.},

Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils are notoriously variable in
   space and time. Measuring and understanding variance in these emissions
   is imperative for improving the accuracy of the greenhouse gas inventory
   and assessing the viability of mitigation options; but data for N2O
   emissions are rather limited. Farm-scale emissions data are also
   required for developing and verifying predictive model estimates. A
   measurement campaign was undertaken from 12 October to 1 November 2006
   at a highly productive grass-clover irrigated dairy farm on a stony silt
   loam soil in North Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. The similar to
   7 ha experimental field, grazed in two morning 6-h grazing sessions
   (21-22 October 2006) by 718 milking dairy cattle, received two
   irrigations during the measurements, one before the grazing event and
   the other during grazing period. We first compare the emission
   measurements using a chamber technique against those made using a
   micrometeorological technique with tuneable diode-laser technology. We
   then compare the measured emissions against emissions predicted by a
   process-based model (New Zealand Denitrification-Decomposition
   (NZ-DNDC)). Daily averaged micrometeorological measurements gave a
   pre-grazing emission of 35 g N2O N/ha/day that increased to >60 g N2O
   N/ha/day following grazing by the dairy herd. The average pre-grazing
   emission of 10 g N2O N/ha/day from the chambers increased to 25 g N2O N
   ha(-1) day(-1) following grazing. The emissions were simulated with
   NZ-DNDC model, which gave average daily emissions of 15 +/- 9 g N2O N
   ha(-1) day(-1) for the pre-grazing period and 22 +/- 6 g N2O N ha(-1)
   day(-1) for the post-grazing period. Here we describe these measurement
   approaches, compare their emission estimates and discuss the advantages
   of combining them for verification of emissions.},

Title = {An overview and assessment of the existing technological options for
   management and resource recovery from beach wrack and dredged sediments:
   An environmental and economic perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The present work discusses the problems and management options of beach
   wrack and dredged sediments. Beach wrack and dredged sediments near the
   shores have affected the coastal ecosystem, badly. The piles of beach
   wrack residues might be a significant emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   and dredged sediment is a substantial source of heavy metals and other
   pollutants. The recovery of valuable resources such as metals and
   nutrients from these so-called ``wastes{''} is a sustainable strategy to
   enhance the resilience of the coastal ecosystem and management. The
   beach wrack meadows can be a potential source for green energy
   production. Even the demand for biodegradable polymers can be supplied
   by utilizing the waste beach wracks. The residues of beach wrack species
   like Posidonia oceanica, Zostera marina, Ulva spc. and Enhalus acorodies
   can be very beneficial species in terms of economic growth. Red algae
   have been the most favored and efficient candidate for methane yield. In
   case of dredged sediment, dewatering of sediment is an essential step
   for successful resource extraction. Although, extraction methods are
   almost similar to that applied for soil treatment, which includes
   pretreatment, physical partitioning, washing, thermal treatment,
   biological extraction, and immobilization. The fractionation study can
   be a beneficial tool for determining the metal species present in the
   sediment. Immobilization techniques are successful but continuous
   monitoring is required. The vitrification technique is highly effective
   but very expensive. Thermal treatment is useful for volatile metals such
   as mercury (Hg), but costs are high. Biological extractions are
   comparatively cheap but time-consuming. Henceforth, very few extraction
   methods are available for sediment and required further advancement in
   this field.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increasing ambient carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration from anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas emission has contributed to the growing rate of global
   land and ocean surface temperature. Various carbon capture and storage
   (CCS) technologies were established to mitigate this impending issue.
   CO2 adsorption is gaining prominence since unlike traditional chemical
   absorption, it does not require high energy usage for solvent
   regeneration and consumption of corrosive chemical solvent. In CO2
   adsorption, activated carbons show high CO2 adsorption capacity given
   their well-developed porous structures. Numerous researches employed oil
   palm wastes as low-cost precursors. This paper provides a comprehensive
   assessment of research works available thus far in oil palm-derived
   activated carbon (OPdAC) for CO2 adsorption application. First, we
   present the desired OPdAC characteristics and its precursors in terms of
   their chemical properties, elemental, and proximate compositions. This
   is followed by an overview of various activation methodologies and
   surface modification methods to attain the desired characteristics for
   CO2 adsorption. Then the focus turned to present available OPdAC CO2
   adsorption performance and how it is affected by its physical and
   chemical characteristics. Based on these, we identify the challenges and
   the potential development in different aspects such as precursor
   selection, process development, and optimization of parameter. A pilot
   scale production cost analysis is also presented to compare various
   activation and surface modification methods, so that the appropriate
   method can be selected for CO2 adsorption.},

Title = {Optimizing historic preservation under climate change: Decision support
   for cultural resource adaptation planning in national parks},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {379-389},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change poses great challenges for cultural resource management,
   particularly in coastal areas. Cultural resources, such as historic
   buildings, in coastal areas are vulnerable to climate impacts including
   inundation, deterioration, and destruction from sea-level rise and
   storm-related flooding and erosion. However, research that assesses the
   trade-offs between actions for protecting vulnerable and valuable
   cultural resources under budgetary constraints is limited. This study
   focused on developing a decision support model for managing historic
   buildings at Cape Lookout National Seashore. We designed the Optimal
   Preservation Decision Support (OptiPres) model to: (a) identify optimal,
   annual adaptation actions for historic buildings across a 30-year
   planning horizon, (b) quantify trade-offs between different actions and
   the timing of adaptation actions under constrained budgets, and (c)
   estimate the effectiveness of budget allocations on the resource value
   of historic buildings. Our analysis of the model suggests that: (1)
   funding allocation thresholds may exist for national parks to maintain
   the historical significance and use potential of historic buildings
   under climate change, (2) the quantitative assessment of trade-offs
   among alternative adaptation actions provides generalizable guidance for
   decision makers about the dynamics of their managed system, and (3) the
   OptiPres model can identify cost-efficient approaches to allocate
   funding to maintain the historical value of buildings vulnerable to the
   effects of climate change. Therefore, the OptiPres model, while not
   designed as a prescriptive decision tool, allows managers to understand
   the consequences of proposed adaptation actions. The OptiPres model can
   guide park managers to make cost-effective climate adaptation decisions
   for historic buildings more transparently and robustly.},

Abstract = {Context. Island landscapes and component biodiversity provide invaluable
   services. However, these are threatened by climate change. There is
   currently no framework for assessing and mitigating such threats on
   islands. Aims. Based on an existing adaptation standard, we aimed to
   propose a systematic approach for planning the adaptation of islands
   based on a risk management process. Methods. For each risk, we
   investigated a range of adaptation approaches that can be considered and
   selected by conservation practitioners in designing conservation
   interventions. Key results. For each risk identified, a range of
   adaptation measures can be selected: do nothing; maintain and enhance
   habitat, intensive species management, and preserve populations
   (including through ex situ conservation); or exploit the natural
   characteristics of islands to conserve biodiversity. Conclusions. This
   approach provides a decision-making matrix of risks/drivers vs
   adaptation measures to assist in the design of conservation
   interventions, which can be applied to Australian islands on a priority
   basis.},

Title = {Sustainable energy planning for remote islands and the waste legacy from
   renewable energy infrastructure deployment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {307},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {The transition towards a sustainable energy mix is required to achieve
   Sustainable Development Goal 7 for affordable and clean energy. Remote
   islands not connected to grid which depend on diesel generators may
   appear ideal because they can benefit from a variety of renewable energy
   sources. However, renewable energy deployment requires a lifetime
   perspective to not inherit waste and other problems to future
   generations. The aim of this paper is to present a life cycle
   sustainability framework developed and applied for the case of the
   island of Ushant off North West France. Seven renewable energy
   generation scenarios were examined and assessed using technoeconomic,
   social and environmental indicators utilising life cycle costing and
   life cycle assessment modelling. The results show that only three out of
   the seven examined renewable energy scenarios manage to cover the 6807
   MWh per annum demand. These scenarios can improve all the indicators
   against the business-as-usual diesel generation scenario except the ones
   related to toxicity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than
   92\%. The easy-to-use framework allows the users to adjust their
   scenarios and receive useful insight about the nature of the trade-offs
   between the various indicators. It can also be adapted and updated to
   include more technologies and support the investigation of more
   sustainable energy scenarios of other remote island cases in the future.

Title = {Do Invasive Mammal Eradications from Islands Support Climate Change
   Adaptation and Mitigation?},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change represents a planetary emergency that is exacerbating the
   loss of native biodiversity. In response, efforts promoting climate
   change adaptation strategies that improve ecosystem resilience and/or
   mitigate climate impacts are paramount. Invasive Alien Species are a key
   threat to islands globally, where strategies such as preventing
   establishment (biosecurity), and eradication, especially invasive
   mammals, have proven effective for reducing native biodiversity loss and
   can also advance ecosystem resilience and create refugia for native
   species at risk from climate change. Furthermore, there is growing
   evidence that successful eradications may also contribute to mitigating
   climate change. Given the cross-sector potential for eradications to
   reduce climate impacts alongside native biodiversity conservation, we
   sought to understand when conservation managers and funders explicitly
   sought to use or fund the eradication of invasive mammals from islands
   to achieve positive climate outcomes. To provide context, we first
   summarized available literature of the synergistic relationship between
   invasive species and climate change, including case studies where
   invasive mammal eradications served to meet climate adaptation or
   mitigation solutions. Second, we conducted a systematic review of the
   literature and eradication-related conference proceedings to identify
   when these synergistic effects of climate and invasive species were
   explicitly addressed through eradication practices. Third, we reviewed
   projects from four large funding entities known to support climate
   change solutions and/or native biodiversity conservation efforts and
   identified when eradications were funded in a climate change context.
   The combined results of our case study summary paired with systematic
   reviews found that, although eradicating invasive mammals from islands
   is an effective climate adaptation strategy, island eradications are
   poorly represented within the climate change adaptation and mitigation
   funding framework. We believe this is a lost opportunity and encourage
   eradication practitioners and funders of climate change adaptation to
   leverage this extremely effective nature-based tool into positive
   conservation and climate resilience solutions.},

Title = {Assessment of Engineering Adaptations to Extreme Events and Climate
   Change for a Simply Supported Interstate Bridge over a Shallow Estuary:
   Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There have been many cases of failures of interstate bridges during
   hurricanes due to the tremendous hydrodynamic loads imposed on them from
   waves on storm surge. Several adaptations have been suggested by others
   to increase a bridge's survivability, but to date there have been no
   widespread, in-depth studies on the effectiveness of adaptation
   measures. This case study investigated four adaptation measures
   (strengthened connections, deck continuity, improved hydrodynamic shape,
   and combinations of measures including increased elevation) for a
   selected bridge and storm scenario. A detailed analysis was performed
   including a complex hydrodynamic analysis and a complete load-path
   analysis to determine the loads and response of the structure. One of
   the key findings of this analysis was that, even with strengthened
   connections, the structure would fail due to negative bending in the
   girders and deck. The results indicate that the only adaptation that
   ensures the survival of the structure is increased elevation; however, a
   combination of adaptation measures does increase resilience and may
   prove to be an effective option with more research and careful analysis.

   endorsement of some adaptation behaviors and policies was lower when
   using the term `climate change' compared with `extreme weather,' while
   in contrast, Democrats' reported willingness to engage in collective
   adaptation behaviors and support for policies related to protecting

Title = {Downscaling Future Longshore Sediment Transport in South Eastern
   Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Modelling investigations into the local changes in the shoreline
   resulting from enhanced atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and
   global climate change are important for supporting the planning of
   coastal mitigation measures. Analysis of Global Climate Model (GCM) and
   Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations has shown that Lakes Entrance,
   a township located at the northern end of Ninety Mile Beach in
   south-eastern Australia, is situated in a region that may experience
   noticeable future changes in longshore winds, waves and coastal
   currents, which could alter the supply of sediments to the shoreline.
   This paper will demonstrate a downscaling procedure for using the data
   from GCM and RCM simulations to force a local climate model (LCM) at the
   beach scale to simulate additional nearshore wind-wave, hydrodynamic and
   sediment transport processes to estimate future changes. Two types of
   sediment transport models were used in this study, the simple empirical
   coastline-type model (CERC equation), and a detailed numerical coastal
   area-type model (TELEMAC). The two models resolved transport in very
   different ways, but nevertheless came to similar conclusions on the
   annual net longshore sediment transport rate. The TELEMAC model, with
   the Soulsby-Van Rijn formulation, showed the importance of the
   contribution of storm events to transport. The CERC equation estimates
   more transport during the period between storms than TELEMAC. The
   TELEMAC modelled waves, hydrodynamics and bed-evolutions are shown to
   agree well with the available observations. A new method is introduced
   to downscale GCM longshore sediment transport projections using
   wave-transport-directional change parameter to modify directional wave
   spectra. We developed a semi-empirical equation (NMB-LM) to extrapolate
   the similar to 3.7-year TELEMAC, storm dominated transport estimates, to
   the longer similar to 30-year hindcast climate. It shows that the
   shorter TELEMAC modelled period had twice as large annual net longshore
   sediment transport of the similar to 30 year hindcast. The CERC equation
   does not pick up this difference for the two climate periods. Modelled
   changes to the wave transport are shown to be an order of magnitude
   larger than changes from storm-tide current and mean sea level changes
   (0.1 to 0.2 m). Discussion is provided on the limitations of the models
   and how the projected changes could indicate sediment transport changes
   in the nearshore zone, which could impact the coastline position.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an innovative approach to assess the benefits of
   adapting to sea level rise (SLR) in a coastal area on a regional scale.
   The valuation framework integrates coastal ecosystem services, together
   with urban and agricultural assets. We simulate the impacts of a
   progressive 1 m rise in sea level in the twenty-first century and an
   extreme flooding event in 2100 for four contrasted adaptation scenarios
   (Denial, ``Laissez-faire{''}, Protection and Retreat). The assessment
   involves coupling the results of hazard-modelling approaches with
   different economic valuation methods, including direct damage functions
   and methods used in environmental economics. The framework is applied to
   the French Mediterranean sandy coastline. SLR will result in major
   land-use changes at the 2100 time horizon: relocation or densification
   of urban areas, loss of agricultural land, increase in lagoon areas and
   modification of wetlands (losses, migration or extension of ecosystems).
   Total benefits of public adaptation options planned in advance could
   reach (sic)31.2 billion for the period 2010-2100, i.e. (sic)69,000 per
   inhabitant (in the study area) in 2010 or (sic)135 million/km of
   coastline. Our results highlight the importance of (i) raising awareness
   to ensure that public services and coastal managers can anticipate the
   consequences of SLR and (ii) incorporating coastal ecosystems into the
   assessment of the adaptation options. Our findings could provide a basis
   for participatory foresight approaches to build coastline adaptation
   pathways.},

Title = {Resilience Adaptation Approach for Reducing the Negative Impact of
   Climate Change on Coastal Heritage Sites through Machine Learning},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The continuous cumulative worsening impact of climate change on heritage
   sites represents a new challenge for most of the nonrenewable resources
   of heritage sites and buildings in general; this is especially true with
   respect to coastal heritage sites, which are facing a more dangerous
   situation as the climate becomes more extreme in coastal areas and sea
   levels rise, putting heritage sites at risk. A strict adaptation plan,
   usually made for reducing the impact of climate change, may not be the
   solution, as different heritage site locations, materials, and hazard
   types need tailored plans. Therefore, in this research paper, a
   resilience approach was introduced to help adapt the most problematic
   sites to the impacts of climate change, i.e., coastal heritage sites. To
   fulfill the objective of achieving adaptation in a resilient way that
   can easily be developed in relation to different types of sites, mixed
   research methods were used. First, the literature was reviewed using the
   Connected Papers tool. Then, machine learning methods were used to
   process and analyze the input data of the resilience adaptation plan for
   an Egyptian coastal heritage site case study, i.e., Alexandria. Next,
   the data were arranged and analyzed, highlighting the main classifying
   algorithms responsible for identifying the resilience range, using the
   machine learning software packages Infra Nodus and WEKA, according to
   the differences in the climate change impact at the heritage sites. The
   final outcome of this research is a resilience approach that can be
   adapted to rescue plans for coastal heritage sites via machine learning.},

Title = {The determinants of integrating policy-based and community-based
   adaptation into coastal hazard risk management: a resilience approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1205-1223},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {A growing number of studies focus on improving the understanding of how
   the households' adaptations can be encouraged in the process of coastal
   hazards and risk management. Particularly, this process is undergoing a
   major paradigm shift as it moves from an approach dominated by
   policy-based adaptation to another one in which community-based
   resilience building is favored. Thus, this article aims to apply a
   resilience approach to improve the knowledge about how public measures
   influence private autonomous adaptation behavior, through a
   transdisciplinary investigation of household adaptation behavior and its
   determinants. The Resilience Framework of Household Autonomous
   Adaptation to Climate- and Weather-Related Hazard Risks (ROHACHR) is
   proposed and combined with a focus group meeting and multivariate
   analysis to compare pre-disaster, during a disaster, post-disaster
   adaptations, and resilience behavior of households. Using an empirical
   survey of the households in three coastal municipalities in Taiwan, we
   examine the relationships between public measures and private
   adaptations that provides three distinguishing types of household
   behavior: `core', `trust in governmental aid', and `awareness and
   structures'. Results show that providing hazard risk information may be
   one step toward encouraging private autonomous adaptations. Several
   factors that help foster resilience also appear to be influential in
   households' adaptation decisions, such as specific and positive
   governmental aid, information trust, and social capital. Based on these
   results, it shows that the ROHACHR is useful to characterize households'
   adaptation and resilience behavior and explain how they respond to
   public measures. Finally, the policy implications of our findings for
   improving resilience of coastal communities and encouraging
   public-private collaboration in the process of hazard risk management
   are discussed.},

Title = {Can novel ingredients replace soybeans and reduce the environmental

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {338-347},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Much of the protein in the diets of European livestock is sourced from
   imported soybeans produced in the Americas. This protein deficit in
   livestock production presents a risk to social, economic and
   environmental progress in Europe. In this study the impact of
   incorporating novel ingredients into future chicken diet formulations to
   serve as European sourced alternatives to imported soybeans was
   investigated. The novel ingredients considered were: microalgae,
   macroalgae, duckweed, yeast protein concentrate, bacterial protein meal,
   leaf protein concentrate and insects. Using horizon scanning and a
   modelling approach, the nutritional requirements of two potential
   meat-producing chicken lines were simulated. The two chicken lines were
   a fast-growing line based on the apparent maximum feed efficiency that
   could be achieved through further artificial selection, and a reduced
   growth rate for high welfare line. Diets were formulated to include the
   novel ingredients, whilst meeting the nutritional requirements of the
   birds. The effects of diet composition on indicators of environmental
   burdens, associated with feed production for the poultry industry, were
   then assessed. We found that soybean products can be completely replaced
   by novel feed ingredients, whilst reducing the greenhouse gas emissions
   and arable land requirements for feed provision relative to conventional
   diets formulated for both chicken lines. Switching from conventional
   diets to diets which incorporate novel ingredients was also shown to
   mitigate the increased environmental burdens associated with moving
   towards higher welfare livestock systems. Incorporation of novel
   ingredients in diet formulations offers a viable option for providing
   sustainable and nutritionally balanced livestock feed in the future and
   thus provides huge potential for facilitating bespoke feeding strategies
   and specific management choices for mitigating environmental impacts of
   chicken systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification is a global, long-term problem whose ultimate
   solution requires carbon dioxide reduction at a scope and scale that
   will take decades to accomplish successfully. Until that is achieved,
   feasible and locally relevant adaptation and mitigation measures are
   needed. To help to prioritize societal responses to ocean acidification,
   we present a spatially explicit, multi-disciplinary vulnerability
   analysis of coastal human communities in the United States. We focus our
   analysis on shelled mollusc harvests, which are likely to be harmed by
   ocean acidification. Our results highlight US regions most vulnerable to
   ocean acidification (and why), important knowledge and information gaps,
   and opportunities to adapt through local actions. The research
   illustrates the benefits of integrating natural and social sciences to
   identify actions and other opportunities while policy, stakeholders and
   scientists are still in relatively early stages of developing research
   plans and responses to ocean acidification.},

Title = {Coping with Climatic Shocks: Empirical Evidence from Rural Coastal

Abstract = {Households in India face numerous climatic shocks, including cyclones
   and floods, and these extreme events have a negative impact on their
   welfare. Although these impacts are likely to increase in the
   foreseeable future due to climate change, households are also taking up
   various coping measures to deal with the impacts from past shocks.
   Hence, assessing the impact of shocks and identifying the determinants
   of various coping options have relevant policy implications in the
   context of designing a disaster mitigation policy. This study examines
   the consumption behaviour and the determinants of traditional coping
   mechanisms adopted by the vulnerable households using household-level
   data collected from cyclone and flood prone districts of the state of
   Odisha in eastern India. The findings suggest that: (i) partial
   consumption smoothing is exhibited with respect to household-specific
   characteristics, (ii) increasing impacts on assets and health
   expenditure due to floods inhibit consumption patterns of households and
   (iii) the adopted traditional coping mechanisms are specific to location
   and household characteristics.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies to floods: A gender-based analysis of the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {519-530},

Abstract = {This paper examines the determinants affecting adaptation strategies
   adopted by men and women in char farming households in Zanjira,
   Bangladesh, to deal with floods. The term char land refers to a
   mid-channel island that periodically appears in the riverbed owing to
   accretion. The study used primary and secondary data. Primary data were
   collected from a household survey from 115 men and 128 women, interviews
   with key informants, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews
   with farmers. For a gender analysis, the study used two separate
   step-wise regression models. Results showed that significant variables
   determining adaptation strategies included agricultural land access,
   availability of agricultural labor, experience in farming, literacy,
   age, and training. Both regressions showed a good fit of the model. The
   higher adjusted R-2 values for the female model revealed that the
   determinants included are more critical for flood adaptation strategies
   than those in the male model. Regression results revealed that
   agricultural land access, agricultural labor, and literacy were the most
   important determinants for both groups. Agriculture land access and
   literacy were more important for women than men. This suggests that
   women's land accessibility and literacy need to be improved to help them
   better adapt to floods. The influence of agricultural labor also seemed
   equally important for men and women. These findings inform useful policy
   recommendations for dealing with floods. Promoting less labor-intensive
   but more remunerative adaptation strategies would help men and women
   manage farming effectively.},

Title = {A Governing Framework for Climate Change Adaptation in the Built
   Environment},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Developing an approach to governing adaptation to climate change is
   severely hampered by the dictatorship of the present when the needs of
   future generations are inadequately represented in current policy
   making. We posit this problem as a function of the attributes of
   adaptation policy making, including deep uncertainty and
   nonstationarity, where past observations are not reliable predictors of
   future outcomes. Our research links organizational decision-making
   attributes with adaptation decision making and identifies cases in which
   adaptation actions cause spillovers, free riding, and distributional
   impacts. We develop a governing framework for adaptation that we believe
   will enable policy, planning, and major long-term development decisions
   to be made appropriately at all levels of government in the face of the
   deep uncertainty and nonstationarity caused by climate change. Our
   framework requires that approval of projects with an expected life span
   of 30 years or more in the built environment include minimum building
   standards that integrate forecasted climate change impacts from the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) intermediate scenario.
   The intermediate IPCC scenario must be downscaled to include local or
   regional temperature, water availability, sea level rise, susceptibility
   to forest fires, and human habitation impacts to minimize climate-change
   risks to the built environment. The minimum standard is systematically
   updated every six years to facilitate learning by formal and informal
   organizations. As a minimum standard, the governance framework allows
   jurisdictions to take stronger actions to increase their climate
   resilience and thus maintain system flexibility.},

Abstract = {Global warming, in combination with the urban heat island effect, is
   increasing the temperature in cities. These changes increase the risk of
   heat stress for millions of city dwellers. Given the large populations
   at risk, a variety of mitigation strategies have been proposed to cool
   cities-including strategies that aim to reduce the ambient air
   temperature. This paper uses common heat stress metrics to evaluate the
   performance of several urban heat island mitigation strategies. The
   authors found that cooling via reducing net radiation or increasing
   irrigated vegetation in parks or on green roofs did reduce ambient air
   temperature. However, a lower air temperature did not necessarily lead
   to less heat stress because both temperature and humidity are important
   factors in determining human thermal comfort. Specifically, cooling the
   surface via evaporation through the use of irrigation increased
   humidity-consequently, the net impact on human comfort of any cooling
   was negligible. This result suggests that urban cooling strategies must
   aim to reduce ambient air temperatures without increasing humidity, for
   example via the deployment of solar panels over roofs or via cool roofs
   utilizing high albedos, in order to combat human heat stress in the
   urban environment.},

Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2020},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Even though indigenous knowledge (IK) is considered as one of the most
   effective strategies in response to climate change issues, this form is
   not being sufficiently integrated into the climate change planning and
   policy at both local and national levels in Vietnam. This study
   investigates the role of the traditional agricultural practices of the
   Xo Dang ethnic minority groups in Central Vietnam and provides insights
   into the factors that influence farmers to adopt these practices in
   response to climate change. Primary data was obtained through three
   focus group discussions and 87 household surveys involving the Xo Dang
   people through face-to-face semi-structured interviews in the Tra Doc
   commune, Bac Tra My district, Quang Nam province, Central Vietnam. The
   binary logistic regression model was used to examine the factors which
   have influenced the choices made by this community in response to
   climate change. The results showed that Xo Dang people were highly aware
   of climate change risks and had, in response, employed their current
   adaptation practices. The major adaptation strategies implemented by the
   Xo Dang people included the use of flora and fauna indicators, native
   plant varieties, the adjustment of planting calendars, irrigation
   practices, and the application of intercropping. The results indicated
   that the living years, their monthly farm incomes, and farmer's
   perceptions of ongoing climate change effects on their environment were
   the factors that significantly affected farmers' adaptation decisions.
   Understanding indigenous knowledge plays a fundamental role in the
   processes of deciding the appropriate adaptation techniques more
   effectively and making use of human resources. Therefore, policy makers
   should pay much attention to indigenous knowledge to combat climate
   change in future national policies and projects.},

Abstract = {Flooding affects Mediterranean coastal areas, with negative impacts on
   regional populations and ecosystems. This paper reviews the causes and
   consequences of coastal flooding in European Mediterranean countries,
   common and advanced solutions implemented to mitigate flood risk, and
   the importance of stakeholder involvement in developing these solutions.
   Climate change, intensive urbanization, tourism, deforestation,
   wildfires, and erosion are the main causes of coastal flooding, leading
   to social and economic losses, degradation of ecosystems, and water and
   soil contamination due to saltwater intrusion. Various measures for
   mitigating urban coastal flooding have been implemented, including
   coastal barriers, infrastructural drainage systems, wetlands, and mobile
   dams. Development and implementation of such solutions should be
   performed in close collaboration with stakeholders, but their current
   engagement at the coordination and/or decision-making level does not
   allow full integration of local knowledge in flood mitigation projects.
   Various processes are used to engage stakeholders in coastal flood
   mitigation, but participatory approaches are required to integrate their
   perspectives into performance analysis of potential solutions. Such
   approaches would allow a balance to be reached between nature
   conservation, market forces, stakeholder needs, and decision-makers'
   priorities, resulting in development of innovative and sustainable
   mitigation solutions to enhance urban resilience to coastal flooding.},

Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},

Volume = {29},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Low-Elevation Coastal Zones in Central and South America are exposed to
   climate-related hazards (sea-level rise, climate variability and storms)
   which threaten the assets (people, resources, ecosystems,
   infrastructure, and the services they provide), and are expected to
   increase due to climate change. A non-systematic review is presented
   focusing on vulnerability elements, impacts, constraints to adaptation,
   and their possible strategies. The analysis emphasises the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Reasons for Concern (e.g.,
   threatened systems, extreme events, aggregated impacts, and critical
   thresholds), particularly on sea-level rise, degradation of mangroves,
   and invasive alien species in Central and South America focusing on case
   studies from Uruguay and Venezuela. Despite recent advances in coastal
   adaptation planning in Central and South America, there is an adaptation
   deficit in the implementation of measures and strategies against
   climate-related hazards, such as sea-level rise. Adaptation constraints
   are linked with poverty, resource allocation, lack of political will,
   and lack of early warning systems for climate-related hazards.
   Non-structural adaptation measures such as community-based adaptation
   and ecosystem-based adaptation are not fully mainstreamed into national
   plans yet. Government-level initiatives (e.g. National Adaptation
   Programmes of Action) are being developed, but a few are already
   implemented. In addition to specific thematic measures, the
   implementation of non-structural approaches, National Adaptation
   Programmes of Action and early warning systems, based on the reasons for
   concern, should foster adaptive capacity in coastal areas. (C) 2019

Title = {From comparative risk assessment to multi-criteria decision analysis and

Abstract = {Environmental risk assessment and decision-making strategies over the
   last several decades have become increasingly more sophisticated,
   information-intensive, and complex, including such approaches as expert
   judgment, cost-benefit analysis, and toxicological risk assessment. One
   tool that has been used to support environmental decision-making is
   comparative risk assessment (CRA), but CRA lacks a structured method for
   arriving at an optimal project alternative. Multi-criteria decision
   analysis (MCDA) provides better-supported techniques for the comparison
   of project alternatives based on decision matrices, and it also provides
   structured methods for the incorporation of project stakeholders'
   opinions in the ranking of alternatives. We argue that the inherent
   uncertainty in our ability to predict ecosystem evolution and response
   to different management policies requires shifting from
   optimization-based management to an adaptive management paradigm. This
   paper brings together a multidisciplinary review of existing
   decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States
   and Europe and synthesizes state-of-the-art research in CRA, MCDA, and
   adaptive management methods applicable to environmental remediation and
   restoration projects. We propose a basic decision analytic framework
   that couples MCDA with adaptive management and its public participation
   and stakeholder value elicitation methods, and we demonstrate
   application of the framework to a realistic case study based on
   contaminated sediment management issues in the New York/New Jersey
   Harbor. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Regional climate influences manure temperature and methane emissions - A
   pan-Canadian modelling assessment},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {750},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This study explores the variation of liquidmanure temperature (T-m) and
   CH4 emissions associated with contrasting regional climates,
   inter-annual weather variation, and manure storage emptying. As a
   case-study, six regions across Canada were used, spanning 11 degrees 32'
   latitude and 58 degrees 30' longitude. Annual average air temperatures
   ranged from 3.9 degrees C (prairie climate) to 10.5 degrees C (maritime
   climate), with an overall average of 6.6 degrees C. A model predicted Tm
   over 30 years, using daily weather (1971-2000), and over one
   ``normal{''} year (30-year average weather). Modelled T-m was then used
   in Manure-DNDC to model daily CH4 emissions. Twomanure storage emptying
   scenarios were simulated: (i) early spring and autumn, or (ii) late
   spring and autumn. Regional differences were evident as average Tm
   ranged from 8.9 degrees C to 14.6 degrees C across the six locations.
   Early removal of storedmanure led to warmer Tm in all regions, and the
   most warming occurred in colder regions. Regional climate had a large
   effect on CH4 emissions (e.g. 1.8x greater in the pacificmaritime and
   great lakes regions than the prairie region). Inter-annual weather
   variability led to substantial variation in inter-annual CH4 emissions,
   with coefficient of variation being as high as 20\%. The large
   inter-annual range suggests that field measurements of CH4 emissions
   need to compare the weather during measurements to historical normals.
   Early manure storage emptying reduced CH4 emissions (vs late removal) in
   some regions but had little effect or the opposite effect in other
   regions. Overall, the results from this modelling study suggest: i) Tm
   differs substantially from air temperature at all locations, ii)
   accurate estimates of manure storage CH4 emissions require
   region-specific calculations using T-m (e.g. in emission inventories),
   iii) field measurements of CH4 emissions need to consider weather
   conditions relative to climate normal, and iv) emission mitigation
   practices will require region-specific measurements to determine
   impacts. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Current Information Provision Rarely Helps Coastal Households Adapt to
   Climate Change},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Households play an important role in reducing coastal vulnerability
   through individual and collective action. Information provision is a key
   strategy adopted by governments to support household adaptation.
   However, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of the different
   types of information and their influence on coastal household response.
   Drawing on case study research in two Australian coastal communities, we
   explore the types of information shaping household responses to three
   hazard scenarios: a heatwave, a severe storm, and sea-level rise. We
   find that passive information informs action in fewer than half of all
   households. Furthermore, even current attempts at more action-oriented
   information only informs coping strategies. If coastal adaptation is to
   achieve the transformational changes vital to manage the impacts of
   climate change, information provision must transition from passive and
   generic delivery via traditional modes, to actively communicating
   adaptation as the `glue' between hazard management and household
   resilience through context-relevant and household-driven communication
   modes. Further research into the types of information that promote
   more-than-coping responses, such as information to facilitate collective
   action, is also recommended.},

Title = {Climate Change and Older Americans: State of the Science},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {121},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-22},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older adults make up 13\% of the U. S. population, but are
   projected to account for 20\% by 2040. Coinciding with this demographic
   shift, the rate of climate change is accelerating, bringing rising
   temperatures; increased risk of floods, droughts, and wildfires;
   stronger tropical storms and hurricanes; rising sea levels; and other
   climate-related hazards. Older Americans are expected to be located in
   places that may be relatively more affected by climate change, including
   coastal zones and large metropolitan areas.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to assess the vulnerability
   of older Americans to climate change and to identify opportunities for
   adaptation.
   METHODS: We performed an extensive literature survey and summarized key
   findings related to demographics; climate stressors relevant to older
   adults; factors contributing to exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
   capacity; and adaptation strategies.
   DISCUSSION: A range of physiological and socioeconomic factors make
   older adults especially sensitive to and/or at risk for exposure to heat
   waves and other extreme weather events (e. g., hurricanes, floods,
   droughts), poor air quality, and infectious diseases. Climate change may
   increase the frequency or severity of these events.
   CONCLUSIONS: Older Americans are likely to be especially vulnerable to
   stressors associated with climate change. Although a growing body of
   evidence reports the adverse effects of heat on the health of older
   adults, research gaps remain for other climate-related risks. We need
   additional study of the vulnerability of older adults and the interplay
   of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive responses to projected
   climate stressors.},

Abstract = {Seaweeds are macroalgae, which can be of many different morphologies,
   sizes, colors, and chemical profiles. They include brown, red, and green
   seaweeds. Brown seaweeds have been more investigated and exploited in
   comparison to other seaweed types for their use in animal feeding
   studies due to their large sizes and ease of harvesting. Recent in vitro
   and in vivo studies suggest that plant secondary compound-containing
   seaweeds (e.g., halogenated compounds, phlorotannins, etc.) have the
   potential to mitigate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants
   when added to the diets of beef and dairy cattle. Red seaweeds including
   Asparagopsis spp. are rich in crude protein and halogenated compounds
   compared to brown and green seaweeds. When halogenated-containing red
   seaweeds are used as the active ingredient in ruminant diets, bromoform
   concentration can be used as an indicator of antimethanogenic
   properties. Phlorotannin-containing brown seaweed has also the potential
   to decrease CH4 production. However, numerous studies examined the
   possible anti-methanogenic effects of marine seaweeds with inconsistent
   results. This work reviews existing data associated with seaweeds and in
   vitro and in vivo rumen fermentation, animal performance, and enteric
   CH4 emissions in ruminants. Increased understanding of the seaweed
   supplementation related to rumen fermentation and its effect on animal
   performance and CH4 emissions in ruminants may lead to novel strategies
   aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while improving animal
   productivity. (C) 2021 Chinese Association of Animal Science and

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {9},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Emerging insights from adaptive and community-based resource management
   suggest that building resilience into both human and ecological systems
   is an effective way to cope with environmental change characterized by
   future surprises or unknowable risks. We argue that these emerging
   insights have implications for policies and strategies for responding to
   climate change. We review perspectives on collective action for natural
   resource management to inform understanding of climate response
   capacity. We demonstrate the importance of social learning, specifically
   in relation to the acceptance of strategies that build social and
   ecological resilience. Societies and communities dependent on natural
   resources need to enhance their capacity to adapt to the impacts of
   future climate change, particularly when such impacts could lie outside
   their experienced coping range. This argument is illustrated by an
   example of present-day collective action for community-based coastal
   management in Trinidad and Tobago. The case demonstrates that
   community-based management enhances adaptive capacity in two ways: by
   building networks that are important for coping with extreme events and
   by retaining the resilience of the underpinning resources and ecological
   systems.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are among the most vulnerable to climate risks.
   Despite the negligence of climate policy at the federal level in the
   United States, subnational governments have taken action to adapt to
   climate change impacts. Using national-level data on subnational
   government climate activities, this research examines three aspects of
   coastal community adaptation actions. First, it examines whether there
   are differences in climate adaptation activity between coastal and
   non-coastal communities. It then tests the relative importance of
   political partisanship, population, perception of climate risk, and
   awareness of state-level climate planning effort. Lastly, it examines
   the impact of participation within climate policy networks on the
   likelihood of a subnational government taking a climate adaptation
   action. Three types of network partners are examined: those focused on
   sea-level rise and coastal communities, climate change mitigation, and
   general environmental organizations. Concern about severe storms,
   awareness of state plans, and having a network partner focused either on
   climate mitigation or the environment were found to be statistically
   significant indicators of climate adaptation action. The paper discusses
   the importance of understanding the localized context of adaptation
   within nested governance structures, and how informal policy networks
   can facilitate learning and innovation across coastal communities.},

Abstract = {Among the biggest global challenges for policymakers is the development
   of land use policies robust to climate change impacts. While diverse
   fields can inform adaptation, integrated social-ecological assessment of
   the multiple adaptation options are rare and cannot be easily applied.
   Here, we build on past studies by undertaking an integrated fine scale
   and strategic allocation of sea level rise (SLR) adaptation options that
   can direct policy making. We use models of probabilistic SLR inundation,
   urban growth, and sub-and intertidal ecosystem migration, to investigate
   the impacts of different SLR adaptation strategies, and how these can be
   allocated to best achieve both development and conservation goals.
   Coastal adaptation will involve trade-offs among development and
   conservation objectives and these will vary based on the extent to which
   sea levels rise. There will be trade-offs between conservation
   objectives regardless of the adaptation options chosen, however, retreat
   does provide opportunities for enabling the expansion of coastal
   ecosystems inland. Local governments can save billions of dollars and
   minimize political conflict between conservation and development goals
   through integrated strategic spatial planning. Our planning approach
   both informs policy and is transferable to other coastal regions faced
   with a rising sea.},

Abstract = {Facing the adverse effects of climate change is one of the biggest
   challenges for the country of Bangladesh. As a low lying downstream
   riparian country (70 percent of land area is 5 m or less above sea
   level), Bangladesh is one of the country's most vulnerable to extreme
   climate events and the impact of climate change, from both flooding and
   sea water intrusion. Climate change is already affecting agricultural
   production with most alarming adverse effects in Bangladesh. Extreme
   weather conditions have changed the overall distribution of yearly
   rainfall, shifted cropping seasons, increased infestation of crops by
   pests and diseases, made the water-table decline in the Barind tract and
   some other areas. At the same time, demand for food is rapidly
   increasing with the population. Enhancing resilience is a major
   challenge not only for agricultural sustainability but also for the
   substantial non-farm rural economy. Hence, the development of climate
   resilient technology and adaptation strategies for food security,
   economic stability, and livelihood security of the people are crucial.
   In this article, an attempt was made to describe the threat of climate
   change, to highlight it's the mitigation process, and to present
   practical implication for extension systems in facing the challenge of
   climate.},

   of ecosystem services for adaptive management of coastal erosion},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are recognized as important providers of ecosystem
   services such as carbon storage, increased fish productivity, and wave
   energy reduction. In a context of climate change, coastal ecosystems are
   exposed to erosion and subject to coastal squeeze, even as they provide
   natural coastal protection against extreme weather. While civil
   engineering solutions often take centre stage in mitigating coastal
   erosion and protecting infrastructure from storms and sea level rise, we
   seek to explore the social dimension of adaptive management of
   socio-ecological systems and more specifically the role of knowledge and
   learning. Using an ecosystem services (ES) framework, we provide a first
   evaluation of local stakeholders' perceptions of coastal habitats in
   maritime Quebec. The findings demonstrate the importance of a social
   approach for coastal ES valuation, in particular in addressing the
   complex question of cultural ES. A better understanding of the links
   between coastal stakeholders and their natural environment can help
   decision-makers and practitioners design conservation management and
   coastal adaptation measures mainstreaming the role of coastal habitats.
   Nevertheless, a change towards a socioecological perspective will
   require long-lasting processes that build on social capacities, such as
   flexible institutions and multilevel governance systems.},

Abstract = {This paper is intended as a brief introduction to climate adaptation in
   a conference devoted otherwise to the physics of sustainable energy.
   Whereas mitigation involves measures to reduce the probability of a
   potential event, such as climate change, adaptation refers to actions
   that lessen the impact of climate change. Mitigation and adaptation
   differ in other ways as well. Adaptation does not necessarily have to be
   implemented immediately to be effective; it only needs to be in place
   before the threat arrives. Also, adaptation does not necessarily require
   global, coordinated action; many effective adaptation actions can be
   local. Some urban communities, because of land-use change and the urban
   heat-island effect, currently face changes similar to some expected
   under climate change, such as changes in water availability,
   heat-related morbidity, or changes in disease patterns. Concern over
   those impacts might motivate the implementation of measures that would
   also help in climate adaptation, despite skepticism among some policy
   makers about anthropogenic global warming. Studies of ancient
   civilizations in the southwestern US lends some insight into factors
   that may or may not be important to successful adaptation.},

Pages = {4-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We conducted a global systematic literature review of climate change
   adaptation in fisheries. We addressed three specific questions: (i) What
   are fisheries adapting to? (ii) How are fisheries adapting? and (iii)
   What research gaps need to be addressed? We identified, characterized
   and examined case studies published between 1990 and 2019 that lie at
   the intersection of the domains of climate change, adaptation and
   fisheries. We characterized the documented climate change effects in
   fisheries that are being adapted to multiple stressors, general climate
   impacts, extreme events, ocean conditions, marine system shifts, climate
   variability, fishery dynamics, species distribution and atmospheric
   warming. Three categories of adaptive responses came to light: coping
   mechanisms (e.g. changing fishing location, use of traditional
   knowledge); adaptive strategies (e.g. livelihood diversification,
   incorporation of technology); and management responses (e.g. adaptive
   management, adaptation planning). We identified key potential areas for
   future research, including studies on the limits and barriers for
   adaptation, studies using specific conceptual and methodological
   approaches, and studies focussing on the top-producing countries such as
   China, Indonesia, Peru and Russia. This analysis gives broader insights
   to the fisheries industry and to climate change adaptation research to
   proceed in the face of new global challenges.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies for coral reef ecosystems in Small Island
   Developing States: Integrated modelling of local pressures and long-term
   climate changes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {253},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Planning and decision-making vastly benefit from a holistic and
   systematic understanding of the long-term impacts of climate change and
   other non-climatic stressors on the health and resilience of coral reef
   ecosystems, and the efficacy of adaptation strategies and management
   interventions on mitigating these impacts and maintaining ecosystem
   condition and associated ecosystem service. This study reports on an
   approach to modelling coral reef stressors and possible adaptation
   interventions using the coral reef ecosystem of Port Resolution on Tanna
   Island, Vanuatu as the case study serving as a microcosm of endangered
   Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). A novel participatory
   modelling framework was developed and followed in a stepwise manner to
   integrate local and long-term climate change pressures by coupling
   structural analysis and the Bayesian Network (BN) techniques. The BN
   model was quantified through an advanced consolidated data-induced,
   evidence-based, and expert-driven approach that incorporated: (1)
   projections of future climate conditions and changing human activities;
   (2) the influences of multiple stressors including physical
   environmental and sociological factors; and (3) spatial variability in
   the key processes and variables. The first and second phases
   conceptualised the whole system by providing a graphical presentation of
   system variables within the Driver-Pressure-StateImpact (DPSI) framework
   using the structural analysis technique. In the third phase, the BN
   technique was used to integrate the outcomes of multidisciplinary
   assessments and analysis with experts' opinion. The BN modelling phase
   was completed based on evidence extracted from literature which reported
   the results of regional and downscaled climate models, GIS-based
   analysis, parametrised data obtained from the region, and tacit
   knowledge elicited from experts. The validated model was employed to
   anticipate the future health and resilience condition of coral reefs
   under different sets of climatic trajectories and adaptive responses
   scenarios. The results predict the risks to the health and resilience of
   the Port Resolution coral reef system from the adverse impacts of
   climate change and harmful human activities and the possible success of
   adaptations strategies. A sobering conclusion was that despite the
   current satisfactory condition of coral reefs in the case study zone,
   their health and resilience would be severely threatened by 2070 in the
   absence of implementing adaptation strategies and associated sustainable
   management interventions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Using the example of ICZM implementation in Cork Harbour - an intensive

   Evidence suggests that despite being implemented through different

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To be successful, conservation practitioners and resource managers must
   fully integrate the effects of climate change into all planning
   projects. Some conservation practitioners are beginning to develop,
   test, and implement new approaches that are designed to deal with
   climate change. We devised four basic tenets that are essential in
   climate-change adaptation for conservation: protect adequate and
   appropriate space, reduce nonclimate stresses, use adaptive management
   to implement and test climate-change adaptation strategies, and work to
   reduce the rate and extent of climate change to reduce overall risk. To
   illustrate how this approach applies in the real world, we explored case
   studies of coral reefs in the Florida Keys; mangrove forests in Fiji,
   Tanzania, and Cameroon; sea-level rise and sea turtles in the Caribbean;
   tigers in the Sundarbans of India; and national planning in Madagascar.
   Through implementation of these tenets conservation efforts in each of
   these regions can be made more robust in the face of climate change.
   Although these approaches require reconsidering some traditional
   approaches to conservation, this new paradigm is technologically,
   economically, and intellectually feasible.},

Title = {Evaluating negative emissions technologies using neutrosophic data
   envelopment analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {286},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Growing energy demand due to population growth and economic progress has
   led to the need for intensive climate change mitigation. Negative
   emissions technologies (NETs) will play an important role in limiting
   global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentration in the
   atmosphere. Available options for NETs can be integrated into energy and
   climate change policies. However, this strategy requires an assessment
   tool to select a suitable set of NETs to be integrated. A mathematical
   framework considering multiple environmental and economic factors under
   uncertainty is needed for the assessment tool. This paper has two main
   contributions: (1) development of a novel multi-criteria decision
   analysis tool based on data envelopment analysis method under
   neutrosophic environment, and (2) application of this tool in the
   evaluation of NETs considering the risks associated with the
   uncertainties in these technologies. The model incorporates
   uncertainties that result in risks when higher performance levels are
   assumed. A novel neutrosophic data envelopment analysis (NDEA) model is
   developed for evaluating NETs; this approach uses neutrosophic set
   theory to account for membership, nonmembership and indeterminacy in
   uncertain parameter values. A case study is presented to illustrated
   this technique. Then, a representative case study considering four
   alternative options for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
   (BECCS) is used to demonstrate the tool. The performance assessment of
   candidate NETs based on literature data is made. Results show different
   characteristics of NETs in terms of their sensitivity to expert's risk
   attitude and perception towards the different dimensions of neutrosophic
   decision-making environment. For instance, the preference of underground
   storage over ocean storage for BECCS is evident when improving the
   technology is assumed to be challenging. Various NETs are evaluated;
   technologies such as BECCS, and afforestation and reforestation show
   consistent ranking in different decision environments. The capability of
   the model to account for uncertainties can allow useful insights to be
   drawn by policy-makers, and thus, accelerate the deployment of NETs. (C)

Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) manifests as the temperature rise in built-up
   urban areas relative to the surrounding rural countryside, largely
   because of the relatively greater proportion of incident solar energy
   that is absorbed and stored by man-made materials. The direct impact of
   UHI can be significant on both daytime and night-time temperatures, and
   the indirect impacts include increased air conditioning loads,
   deteriorated air and water quality, reduced pavement lifetimes, and
   exacerbated heat waves. Modifying the thermal properties and emissivity
   of roofs and paved surfaces and increasing the vegetated area within the
   city are potential mitigation strategies. A quantitative comparison of
   their efficacies and costs suggests that so-called cool roofs are likely
   the most cost-effective UHI mitigation strategy. However, additional
   research is needed on how to modify surface emissivities and dynamically
   control surface and material properties, as well as on the health and
   socioeconomic impacts of UHI.},

Title = {Climate adaptation indicators and metrics: State of local policy
   practice},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent systematic reviews show that, overall, and across governance
   levels and sectors, climate change adap-tation monitoring and evaluation
   (M\&E) systems are rarely programmed and implemented. As a result, there
   is a generalized lack of knowledge and practice regarding the definition
   and use of adaptation indicators and metrics from which to effectively
   learn. This paper focuses on understanding the emergent state of
   practice regarding adaptation indicators and metrics at the local level:
   what indicators and metrics are used? What aspects of the adaptation
   process are they measuring? How will they be monitored, evaluated, and
   reported? Out of a sample of the largest 136 coastal cities worldwide,
   only 59 cities have adaptation-related plans and only 11 (Athens,
   Auckland, Barcelona, Glasgow, Lima, Montreal, Nagoya, New York City,
   Portland, Tokyo, and Vancouver) list indicators and metrics. Sourced
   from these documents, we compile and code a total of 1971 indicators, of
   which 1841 focus fully or partially on adaptation-related aspects. We
   study the level of detail (objective, indicator, metric), type (target,
   input, output, outcome, or impact), scale, dimension, units of
   measurement, target, and proposed monitoring timeframe, among other
   aspects. Data shows that current adaptation measurement frameworks are
   tied to the degree to which each city integrates and addresses
   adaptation in its policies. A majority of adaptation indicators and
   metrics measure outputs, i.e. implementation aspects. Outcome indicators
   are generally connected to users or beneficiaries of adaptation measures
   and impact indicators are mostly related to health (e.g.
   hospitalizations). Targets and monitoring timeframes, as well as data
   sources, are rarely defined. We connect this to a lack of definition of
   local adaptation goals and a poor understanding of how specific
   adaptation actions lead to vulnerability reductions and resilience
   increases. Based on the identified gaps, we propose a metric development
   guiding framework to stimulate discussion around effective and feasible
   ap-proaches to measure adaptation progress based on improved adaptation
   decision-making. We argue, that our results should fuel a critical
   revision of current adaptation planning practices that might ultimately
   facilitate processes of learning, experimentation and innovation in this
   embryonic field.},

Abstract = {Reducing vulnerabilities is at the core of climate change adaptation
   interventions. This goal is usually approached from the perspective of
   increasingly universal adaptation methodologies, tools and services that
   are grounded in Western scientific thought and knowledge. Questions of
   (in-)justices and new or reproduced vulnerabilities play a marginal role
   in adaptation interventions. In this paper, we argue that a failure to
   acknowledge, let alone address, the intricate linkages between knowledge
   and power risks creating fundamental injustices as part of well-intended
   adaptation processes and their outcomes. Using the Kiribati Adaptation
   Project (KAP) as a case study, we examine how knowledge hegemonies lead
   to unsatisfactory adaptation processes and outcomes when viewed from a
   justice perspective. Environmental justice lenses provide a useful
   framework for applying distributional, procedural and epistemic notions
   of injustice to tackle and interrogate the knowledge-power relations,
   which we identify as a profound part of adaptation interventions.},

Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {It is essential to monitor accurately current sea level changes to
   better understand and project future sea level rise (SLR). This is the
   basis to support the design of adaptation strategies to climate change.
   Altimeter sea level products are operationally produced and distributed
   by the E.U. Copernicus services dedicated to the marine environment
   (CMEMS) and climate change (C3S). The present article is a review paper
   that intends to explain why and to which extent the sea level monitoring
   indicators derived from these products are appropriate to develop
   adaptation strategies to SLR. We first present the main key scientific
   questions and challenges related to SLR monitoring. The different
   processing steps of the altimeter production system are presented
   including those ensuring the quality and the stability of the sea level
   record (starting in 1993). Due to the numerous altimeter algorithms
   required for the production, it is complex to ensure both the retrieval
   of high-resolution mesoscale signals and the stability of the
   large-scale wavelengths. This has led to the operational production of
   two different sea level datasets whose specificities are characterized.
   We present the corresponding indicators: the global mean sea level
   (GMSL) evolution and the regional map of sea level trends, with their
   respective uncertainties. We discuss how these products and associated
   indicators support adaptation to SLR, and we illustrate with an example
   of downstream application. The remaining gaps are analyzed and
   recommendations for the future are provided.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {491-501},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The nascent nature of offshore renewable energy (ORE) technologies
   coupled with the existence of considerable data gaps and uncertainty on
   the receiving marine environment demands a paradigm shift in our
   approach to assessing and managing the impacts of the ORE sector on
   marine Natura 2000 sites. This paper investigates how the
   ecosystem-based principles of resilience and adaptive management can be
   best applied under the appropriate assessment process of the Habitats
   Directive to reconcile the increasing demand for offshore renewables and
   biodiversity conservation. In so doing, it challenges the strict
   interpretation of the precautionary principle which has been
   crystallised by the EU judiciary under the regime of Article 6(3) of the
   Habitats Directive and suggests embracing adaptive management as a
   better methodology to enhance the outcomes of the appropriate assessment
   in the face of uncertain impacts on Natura 2000 sites and their
   qualifying features. The aim of this study is solution-based: it seeks
   to improve the implementation of the assessment procedure of the
   Habitats Directive before it truly becomes an `obstacle course' for
   offshore renewable energy developers.},

Title = {Adaptation to climate change in Quebec's coastal zone: a difficult
   transformation of public action},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {282-298},
Abstract = {Purpose-In recent years, the manifestation of the effects of climate
   change in coastal zones has prompted governments to mobilize and propose
   adaptation measures to reduce the vulnerability of their populations.
   For the governments responsible for the implementation of climate
   policies, adaptation still represents a novel field of action. The
   purpose of this paper is to show, via the example of Quebec's coastal
   zone, how the transformation of public action relating to adaptation
   remains difficult.
   Design/methodology/approach-For this case study, a qualitative method
   which combines documentary analysis and semi-directed interviews was
   selected.
   Findings-The study shows how adaptation becomes a new issue in public
   action for the different authorities dealing with the effects of climate
   change in Quebec's coastal zone. However, the results show that, as with
   other public policies, path dependence and incrementalism can be
   observed and limit the scope of public action and of the
   transformational processes in the field of adaptation. The
   technical-scientific approach to risk management is dominant, and the
   adaptation is not approached in a transversal way, despite its
   importance. Finally, concrete adaptation initiatives appear to be mostly
   relegated to the local scale, in an informal decentralization process.
   Originality/value-This study contributes to improve climate action by
   favouring a reflection on the consideration of the conceptual and
   theoretical framework in the climate change adaptation literature and
   offers decision-makers and practitioners keys to the understanding of
   mechanisms underlying public action in the field of adaptation.},

Title = {Living in hazardous waterscapes: Gendered vulnerabilities and
   experiences of floods and disasters},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {43-53},
Abstract = {Considerable literature exists on floods and weather-related disasters,
   but limited attention has been given to the varied social implications
   of hazards in the lives of people, especially from a gender perspective.
   This is particularly poignant in floodplains and coastal areas, where
   water is a key element in giving, sustaining and taking away life and
   livelihood. Critical social and geographical analyses enable better
   understanding of the ways hazardous waterscapes are perceived,
   experienced and negotiated by people across social categories in their
   everyday life. This article attempts to highlight the gendered and
   classed coping strategies and adaptation measures that men and women
   engage with (that both challenge and reproduce social relations and
   vulnerabilities) in their attempts to survive in hazardous environments.
   Drawing from an analysis of the gendered dynamics of floods and
   disasters as well as the interventions that were undertaken via the
   Flood Action Plan in Bangladesh, I demonstrate the differential and
   gendered implications of both water-related hazards and the structural
   interventions that were envisioned to address the hazards. With climate
   change likely to exacerbate floods and disasters, it is important to
   heed such differentiations and marginalizations, so as to draw insights

Title = {Salt marshes to adapt the flood defences along the Dutch Wadden Sea
   coast},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Concern about the effects of climate change have set in motion a search
   for flood protection measures to adapt coastlines to the foreseen
   accelerated sea level rise. In this context, the potential role of salt
   marshes to adapt the Wadden Sea's flood defences was explored in the
   Netherlands Wadden Region Delta Programme. This paper provides an
   overview of the steps taken by the programme in developing a climate
   change adaptation strategy so that others might learn from its
   experiences. The second aim is to summarize the knowledge generated by
   the programme on the potential role of salt marshes as part of a climate
   change adaption strategy. Explorative modelling results indicate that
   Wadden Sea salt marshes affect wave heights, even under extreme
   conditions. Therefore, a salt-marsh zone in front of the Wadden Sea
   dikes that could keep pace with sea level rise may result in a reduced
   dike reinforcement task. A salt marsh potential map gives a rough
   impression of locations that are potentially interesting for salt marsh
   conservation and development, based on the current situation, on
   available information about abiotic conditions for salt marsh formation
   and the habitats present in the coastal zone. Besides elongated
   stretches were seminatural salt marshes are already present or
   developing, several stretches along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast have
   favourable abiotic conditions for salt marsh development. However, the
   prospects for integrating salt marshes into flood defences depend also
   on other aspects. Various nature conservation agreements are in effect
   with their associated obligations. Furthermore, the foreseen value of
   salt marsh development compared to traditional reinforcements, in terms
   of both costs and benefits, must be considered.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {148-155},

Abstract = {Maritime transport and shipping are impacted negatively by biofouling,
   which can result in increased fuel consumption. Thus, costs for fouling
   reduction can be considered an investment to reduce fuel consumption.
   Anti-fouling measures also reduce the rate of introduction of
   non-indigenous species (NIS). Further mitigation measures to reduce the
   transport of NIS within ballast water and sediments impose additional
   costs. The estimated operational cost of NIS mitigation measures may
   represent between 1.6\% and 4\% of the annual operational cost for a
   ship operating on European seas, with the higher proportional costs in
   small ships. However, fouling by NIS may affect fuel consumption more
   than fouling by native species due to differences in species'
   life-history traits and their resistance to antifouling coatings and
   pollution. Therefore, it is possible that the cost of NIS mitigation
   measures could be smaller than the cost from higher fuel consumption
   arising from fouling by NIS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Growing hope: Island agriculture and refusing catastrophe in climate
   change adaptation in Fiji},
Journal = {ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {136-155},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In both media and policy, climate change is broadly framed as the
   promise of catastrophe for small island states such as Fiji. This
   framing is often used to attract adaptation investment in islands, the
   targets and directives of which are frequently market-based and oriented
   toward economic-growth development models. In Fiji, this takes the form
   of land tenure policy and efforts to attract investment to support
   agricultural modernization. Such a pattern is the source of scholarly
   and activist critique that climate change adaptation is nothing more
   than a repackaging of neoliberal development. This paper seeks to
   situate such critique alongside parallel attention to climate change
   adaptation practices emerging from alternative, hopeful frames and aimed
   at less national development driven efforts. In doing so, it centers
   adaptation as a space of unsettled struggle and asks, in what ways do
   climate change adaptation practices in Fiji align and conflict with
   dominant framing of island vulnerability and climate catastrophe, and
   how might they suggest alternative adaptive interventions that
   renegotiate these frames? Specifically, this paper focuses on efforts to
   promote `traditional' agriculture throughout Fiji as an endogenous and
   hopeful form of adaptation, and one consistently opposed to efforts at
   agricultural modernization as an adaptation strategy.},

Abstract = {The exploration of evolutionary biology and biological adaptation can
   inform society's adaptation to climate change, particularly the
   mechanisms that bring about adaptability, such as phenotypic plasticity,
   epigenetics, and horizontal gene transfer. Learning from unplanned
   autonomous biological adaptation may be considered undesirable and
   incompatible with human endeavor. However, it is argued that there is no
   need for agency, and planned adaptation is not necessarily preferable
   over autonomous adaptation. What matters is the efficacy of adaptive
   mechanisms and their capacity to increase societal resilience to current
   and future impacts. In addition, there is great scope for industrial
   ecology (IE) to contribute approaches to climate change adaptation that
   generate system models and baseline data to inform decision making. The
   problem of ``uncertainty{''} was chosen as an example of a challenge
   that is shared by biological systems, IE, and climate change adaptation
   to show how biological adaptation might contribute solutions. Finally,
   the Coastal Climate Adaptation Decision Support tool was used to
   demonstrate how IE and biological adaptation approaches may be
   mainstreamed in climate change adaptation planning and practice. In
   conclusion, there is close conceptual alignment between evolutionary
   biology and IE. The integration of biological adaptation thinking can
   enrich IE, add new perspectives to climate change adaptation science,
   and support IE's engagement with climate change adaptation. There should
   be no major obstacles regarding the collaboration of industrial
   ecologists with the climate change adaptation community, but
   mainstreaming of biological adaptation solutions depends greatly on
   successful knowledge transfer and the engagement of open-minded and
   informed adaptation stakeholders.},

   Working Progress?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Growth and diversification of tourism activities in Antarctica have not
   been matched by proactive strategies for planning or management.
   Recognizing that the adaptive management approach has been effectively
   implemented in managing tourism in protected areas, we examine to what
   extent this approach has been incorporated into the Antarctic tourism
   research and management, and what constraints exist for its
   implementation. To better understand the extent of literature
   contributions, we conducted an appraisal of 72 peer-reviewed journal
   articles published from 1992 to 2020 and Antarctic management documents.
   From a scientific perspective, researchers have been advocating for
   adaptive management approaches to Antarctic tourism and have applied
   different elements, particularly ecological assessments, design of
   management measures, monitoring, and regulatory mechanisms. However,
   these contributions have not been necessarily translated into management
   policy and regulations. We acknowledge that full implementation of an
   adaptive management approach is not easily achievable due to the unique
   Antarctic regime. However, we argue that comprehensive site-specific and
   regional adaptive management models could be applied as the first step
   for a more systematic implementation. This incremental approach could
   contribute to enhanced stakeholder participation and improved
   decision-making processes, ultimately leading to a more proactive and
   effective management of Antarctic tourism, essential for the
   conservation of the continent.},

Abstract = {The rising frequency of heat-related hazards as a result of climate
   change will increasingly affect heat-sensitive infrastructure assets.
   Recent studies quantify the heat-related risk to infrastructure, with
   some exploration of individual mitigation strategies, however missing in
   literature is an infrastructure sector-transferable and comprehensive
   framework for analyzing future risk and performing evaluation of several
   options for risk reduction. This paper introduces a generic framework
   to: quantify heat-related risks to infrastructure assets in a
   transferable manner; assess the effects of future exogenous systems
   changes, and; evaluate several practical mitigation strategies. The
   framework is applied to the asphalt road network in Adelaide, Australia.
   This case study explores heat-related risk under present and future
   climate hazard and traffic stressor scenarios and critical evaluation of
   mitigation strategies. The strategies explored affect both hazard and
   vulnerability elements of risk, including: asphalt binder materials,
   reflectivity additives, and traffic volume, loading or speed management.
   Results indicate up to a 19\% increase in risk from 2020 to 2090 as a
   result of climate change. Road replacement strategies are identified as
   most effective, reducing risk by up to 33\% in 2090. The framework shows
   value in developing comprehensive and practical strategies for managing
   heat-sensitive infrastructure assets into the future.},

Title = {Multistate assessment of wetland restoration on CO2 and N2O emissions
   and soil bacterial communities},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {76},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Over the last 200 years, wetlands have been converted to other land uses
   leading to the loss of approximately 53\% of wetlands in the continental
   United States. In the late 1980's, policies were instated to mitigate
   further wetland loss through wetland creation and restoration. Restored
   wetlands provide important ecosystem services, such as filtration of
   nutrients and wildlife habitat. However, these benefits could be offset
   by increased greenhouse gas production. We assessed the impact of
   wetland conversion to agriculture and restoration on CO2 and N2O
   emissions and microbial communities in three land use types: wetlands
   with native vegetation (natural); wetlands converted to agricultural
   management (converted); and restored wetlands (restored). Soil
   properties varied among land use types. Most notably, soils from
   restored and converted sites had the lowest C and N, and higher pH.
   Multivariate analysis of soil properties showed the pocosin wetlands in
   North Carolina separating from all other locations, regardless of land
   use. Soil bacterial communities showed a similar trend with communities
   from North Carolina soils separating from the others with no significant
   effect of land use or season. Furthermore, land use did not have a
   significant effect on CO2 or N2O emissions, although there was
   significant temporal variation in CO2 emissions. These findings indicate
   that while wetland conversion and restoration may alter some soil
   properties, these alterations do not appear to be great enough to
   override the underlying geographic and edaphic influences on soil
   bacterial communities. Furthermore, wetland restoration did not lead to
   increased N2O emission at the dates sampled. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Reducing nitrous oxide emissions by changing N fertiliser use from
   calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) to urea based formulations},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {563},
Pages = {576-586},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The accelerating use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilisers, to meet the
   world's growing food demand, is the primary driver for increased
   atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O). The IPCC default
   emission factor (EF) for N2O from soils is 1\% of the N applied,
   irrespective of its form. However, N2O emissions tend to be higher from
   nitrate-containing fertilisers e.g. calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)
   compared to urea, particularly in regions, which have mild, wet climates
   and high organic matter soils. Urea can be an inefficient N source due
   to NH3 volatilisation, but nitrogen stabilisers (urease and
   nitrification inhibitors) can improve its efficacy. This study evaluated
   the impact of switching fertiliser formulation from calcium ammonium
   nitrate (CAN) to urea-based products, as a potential mitigation strategy
   to reduce N2O emissions at six temperate grassland sites on the island
   of Ireland. The surface applied formulations included CAN, urea and urea
   with the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT)
   and/or the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD). Results showed
   that N2O emissions were significantly affected by fertiliser
   formulation, soil type and climatic conditions. The direct N2O emission
   factor (EF) from CAN averaged 1.49\% overall sites, but was highly
   variable, ranging from 0.58\% to 3.81. Amending urea with NBPT, to
   reduce ammonia volatilisation, resulted in an average EF of 0.40\%
   (ranging from 0.21 to 0.69\%)-compared to an average EF of 0.25\% for
   urea (ranging from 0.1 to 0.49\%), with both fertilisers significantly
   lower and less variable than CAN. Cumulative N2O emissions from urea
   amended with both NBPT and DCD were not significantly different from
   background levels. Switching from CAN to stabilised urea formulations
   was found to be an effective strategy to reduce N2O emissions,
   particularly in wet, temperate grassland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The international scientific community is increasingly recognizing the
   role of natural systems in climate-change mitigation. While forests have
   historically been the primary focus of such efforts, coastal wetlands -
   particularly seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves - are now
   considered important and effective long-term carbon sinks. However, some
   members of the coastal and marine policy and management community have
   been interested in expanding climate mitigation strategies to include
   other components within coastal and marine systems, such as coral reefs,
   phytoplankton, kelp forests, and marine fauna. We analyze the scientific
   evidence regarding whether these marine ecosystems and ecosystem
   components are viable long-term carbon sinks and whether they can be
   managed for climate mitigation. Our findings could assist decision
   makers and conservation practitioners in identifying which components of
   coastal and marine ecosystems should be prioritized in current climate
   mitigation strategies and policies.},

Title = {Indigenous coping and adaptation strategies to climate change of local
   communities in Tanzania: a review},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Pages = {406-416},
Abstract = {Climate change has major impacts to the livelihoods of the rural
   communities. In order to counteract the situation communities have
   developed various means for coping and adapting to the impacts. This
   paper reviews the various adaptation strategies by which different local
   communities (fishermen, pastoralists and farmers) in Tanzania have
   developed and discusses the sustainability of some of the strategies. It
   has been documented that farmers in Tanzania use traditional practices
   such as terracing (matuta), ngolo, tree planting, and construction of
   locally based water reservoirs (nkunisa), mixed cropping and crop
   diversification. Pastoralists use strategies such as ngitiri, rain water
   harvesting in ditches (malambo), check dams and engagement in
   alternative economic activities; and fishermen use methods such as
   change in fishing time, deep water fishing, scheduling particular time
   for fishing and engagement in other alternative economic activities.
   Based on the ability of the strategy to improve the capacity of the
   communities to respond to climate change effects, ease of
   implementation, the affordability, the strategies have been categorized
   as sustainable or not. It has been noted that the use of the sustainable
   indigenous strategies can improve the management of climate change
   effects provided that the underlying limitations are overcome. The
   limitations to the effectiveness of some of the documented coping and
   adaptation strategies may arise for instance from failure to fit the
   local context. It is therefore concluded that the analysis of a number
   of scenarios need to be undertaken prior to replication of any strategy.},

   commercial species},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Climate change is already impacting fisheries with species moving across
   fishing areas, crossing institutional borders, and thus creating
   conflicts over fisheries management. In this scenario, scholars agree
   that adaptation to climate change requires that fisheries increase their
   social, institutional, and ecological resilience. The resilience or
   capacity of a fishery to be maintained without shifting to a different
   state (e.g., collapse) is at stake under climate change impacts and
   overexploitation. Despite this urgent need, applying the resilience
   concept in a spatially explicit and quantitative manner to inform policy
   remains unexplored. We take a resilience approach and operationalize the
   concept in industrial fisheries for two species that have been observed
   to significantly shift distribution in European waters: hake (Merluccius
   merluccius) and cod (Gadus morhua), in the context of the European Union
   institutional settings. With a set of resilience factors from the
   literature and by means of contemporary and historic data, we select
   indicators that are combined into an index that measures resilience on
   the ecologic, socioeconomic, and institutional dimensions of the
   fishery. We find that the resilience index varies among species and
   countries, with lower resilience levels in the socioeconomic dimension
   of the fisheries. We also see that resilience largely depends on the
   overexploitation status of the fishery. The results highlight the need
   to address social and institutional settings to enhance fisheries
   adaptation to climate change and allow to inform on climate resilient
   adaptation pathways for the fisheries.},

Abstract = {Climate change will affect all types of infrastructure, including energy
   system. Rising temperatures, increased flood risk and other potential
   hazards will threaten the reliable and efficient energy supply with
   potentially large economic and social impacts.
   To strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related
   hazards for the Italian electric sector, several adaptation and
   mitigation actions are to be implemented.
   In order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts
   and vulnerabilities, some updated climate change scenarios have been
   elaborated over Italy on the basis of high-resolution climate models
   provided by the EU-funded Project Euro-CORDEX with horizontal resolution
   of 0.11 degrees (-12 km) under the Representative Concentration Pathway
   RCP 8.5. The climate change scenarios have been characterized at
   seasonal scale, by comparing the current climate (1971-2000) with
   projections at short (FUT1=2021-2050), medium (2041-2070) and long
   (FUT2=2071-2100) terms.
   Without mitigation actions, the more significant results highlight a
   warming of about 2 degrees C in the next decades, 3 degrees C in the mid
   of the century, and more than 5 degrees C in the last thirty years
   period. Moreover a precipitation decrease is expected, with significant
   reduction in the summer ranging in between 10 and 20\% in the first half
   of the century, until 50\% at the end of it.
   Hot days and coastal floods show the most dramatic rise, but the risks
   of inland flooding will depend on both the season and the Italian
   region.
   Wet-snow events are projected to decrease considerably in the areas
   nowadays affected by these phenomena, whereas they are likely to
   increase significantly over Alps, kept free of wet snow until now.
   Larger uncertainties characterize the Central and Northern Apennines
   where the signal is almost absent and no useful information can be
   inferred for these areas.},

Title = {Transnational Municipal Networks as a Mechanism for Marine Governance
   Toward Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation: Between Potential and
   Practice},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Many municipalities undertake actions individually and/or collectively,
   in cooperation with central administrations, regional authorities, the
   private sector, and other municipalities (both nationally and
   internationally). This paper aims to examine how they use transnational
   municipal networks (TMNs) as a tool for cooperation that supports marine
   governance in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation.
   The analysis is carried out at two dimensions: spatial range (global or
   regional) and spatial identity (coastal or inland). Three case studies
   of TMNs are examined in detail: the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group
   (C40); Connecting Delta Cities (CDC) and the Union of Baltic Cities
   (UBC). As research has shown, due to their organizational and normative
   limitations and a lack of maturity in ocean literacy, TMNs are not able
   to fully engage in all the activities related to climate change
   adaptation and mitigation as suggested by the UNEP. The TMNs implement
   both mitigation and adaptation measures, although `soft' mitigation
   actions seem to be the most common. While the scale and innovativeness
   of a networks' operation are determined by their specificity resulting
   from their spatial identity, the effectiveness of jointly developed
   strategies and actions depend heavily on the allocation of human
   resources and the level of commitment of the involved cities toward
   becoming leaders.},

Title = {Why uncertainty in community livelihood adaptation is important for
   adaptive delta management: A case study in polders of Southwest
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {54-65},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {To deal with large uncertainties about future climate and socio-economic
   developments, planners in deltas are adopting an integrative and
   adaptive planning approach referred to as Adaptive Delta Management
   (ADM). Bangladesh has used the ADM approach for the development of its
   adaptive plan; Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP 2100). The success of
   policy strategies in an adaptive delta plan critically depends on a
   specific adaptation of livelihoods of local communities (Community
   Livelihood Adaptation; CLA), especially in an agriculture oriented
   society like Bangladesh. For example, while triple rice cropping might
   be evaluated as a robust strategy in all futures considered, its success
   eventually depends on whether farmers? will actually make that choice,
   which is deeply uncertain. In this paper, we use literature review,
   insights from interviews and field observations to examine how the
   uncertainty in CLA impacts (adaptive) delta management. We study two
   historical cases of livelihood adaptation of farmer communities
   confronted with salinization and waterlogging in the polders of
   southwest Bangladesh since the 1960s. We conclude that historically the
   uncertainty about CLA in polders has been ignored in the development of
   policy plans, leading to the failure of anticipated policy outcomes. We
   recommend planners in Bangladesh and other deltas worldwide to take
   account of CLA as uncertainty when developing long-term adaptive plans.},

Title = {Adaptation to climate change-related ocean acidification: An adaptive
   governance approach},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {191},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Climate change-driven ocean acidification (OA) is causing rapid change
   to global ecosystems and poses a significant threat to marine life.
   However, predicting ecosystem effects remains highly uncertain and
   governance responses to OA are not yet forthcoming. Adaptive governance
   can provide a means to deal with this uncertainty and we consider its
   application to the polycentric governance of adaptation responses to OA
   in Scotland, focussing on the aquaculture industry as a vulnerable
   sector. A workshop was used to develop potential responses to OA and to
   gain information about present and potential capacity for adaptive
   governance at national and regional levels. Scottish legislation, policy
   and planning documents were subsequently analysed to enable description
   of how governance and management arrangements constrain or enable
   adaptation responses. Legislative and policy analysis indicates
   convergence across emerging mechanisms in support of adaptive governance
   and identified interventions. Recent advances in climate change
   adaptation in Scotland promotes integration of adaptation into wider
   Scottish Government policy development and functions, based on iterative
   and collaborative processes across scales. Alongside this, new models of
   coastal and marine governance, including a partnership-led regional
   marine planning process and devolution of seabed management rights under
   Crown Estate Scotland, seek to advance new models of locally-led and
   learning-based planning and management which can support adaptation
   responses. However, adaptation measures at operational scale requires
   flexibility in the aquaculture licensing regime which is currently of
   low adaptive capacity. Further, expansion of the industry faces social
   and ecological constraints which limit spatial measures, and are
   complicated by uncertainty in predicting local OA effects. Expanding the
   use of holistic and co-operative management tools such as Aquaculture
   Management Areas could support adaptation across wider spatial scales.
   Better integration across policy and planning instruments is also needed
   to enhance adaptive capacity, including between climate change
   adaptation, marine planning and aquaculture planning and management.
   This could be enabled by establishing links between existing and
   proposed collaborative groups to enhance development of adaptation
   responses and through co-ordination of monitoring and review processes
   to promote learning across scales.},

Title = {Climate-induced species range shift and local adaptation strategies in a

   Island, western Japan},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {In temperate seas, expansion of reef-building coral distribution,
   decline of macroalgal beds, and changes in constituent species for coral
   communities and/or macroalgal beds mainly due to increase in sea surface
   temperature have been reported. Not only mitigation but also adaptive
   responses are important for the measures against climate change.
   Consideration of adaptive measures depends on local conditions such as
   the degree of environmental change and industrial structure is necessary
   when measures are implemented. This study focused on the marine
   protected area (Ashizuri-Uwakai National Park in Japan) and its
   surrounding area. This area is characterized by a very large north-south
   gradient in water temperature and the distribution of corals and
   macroalgae along it. The purpose of this study is to consider what
   adaptive measures are suitable for each region and industry in response
   to changes in coastal ecosystems (coral community and macroalgal bed).
   Future (assuming the end of this century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5
   scenarios) changes in the potential distribution area of coral,
   macroalgae, and their consumers were projected using simulated sea
   surface temperature with a highspatial resolution. After projecting the
   coastal ecosystem changes and assessing the contemporary use of coastal
   ecosystem, we give examples of what specific adaptive measures should be
   taken in each area for three fields, i.e., biodiversity conservation,
   fisheries, and tourism. Assuming the 2090s, though drastic changes in
   coastal ecosystem are not projected compared to the present state under
   RCP2.6 scenario, as coral distribution shifts north, feeding damage by
   crown-of-thorn starfish is projected to become a problem. Therefore,
   expansion of protected areas and promotion of conservation activities
   are major challenges for coral ecosystem conservation. On the other
   hand, under RCP8.5 scenario, it is important to take appropriate
   conservation measures for macroalgae since coral growth becomes
   difficult to achieve and grazing pressure on macroalgae increases due to
   extreme elevated water temperature. Moreover, creation of alternate or
   new tourism resources will be needed. This research represents projected
   scenarios of coastal ecosystem changes with a high spatial resolution
   and adaptation measures based on the changes for each municipality.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change and related ocean warming have affected marine ecological
   and socioeconomic systems worldwide. Therefore, it is critically
   important to assess the performance of conservation mechanisms,
   particularly marine protected areas (MPAs) to moderate the risks of
   climate-related impacts. In this study, sea surface temperature trends
   of Australian Commonwealth MPAs are assessed against climate change
   management criteria, as defined in Adapting to Climate Change: Guidance
   for Protected Area Managers and Planners. Monthly sea surface
   temperature trends between 1993 and 2017 were statistically assessed
   using the Mann-Kendall trend test and management plans were subject to a
   thematic analysis. Temperature trends showed variable SST changes among
   the regions, with the northern reserves all showing statistically
   significant increases in temperature, and the Southwest Network having
   the least number of reserves with statistically significant increases in
   temperature. The thematic analysis shows that management plans address
   approximately half of the climate change adaptation criteria. Several
   management strategies, such as dynamic MPAs, replication, and
   translocations, are currently absent and have been suggested as
   necessary tools in supporting the climate readiness of Australian MPAs.
   This study is significant because it helps to identify and synthesize
   regions most vulnerable to the impacts of ocean warming and provides
   management suggestions make MPAs ``climate ready.{''}},

Abstract = {In the past decades the topic of climate change has been subjected to
   intense scientific scrutiny, and since the mid-1990's it has become an
   increasingly political issue. Because of increased temperatures and more
   frequent and intense extreme weather events, the number of direct
   injuries and deaths will increase, along with infectious diseases,
   whether food, water or vector-borne; respiratory and cardiovascular
   diseases are expected to rise due to worsened air pollution and extreme
   heat. In a context of on-going environmental degradation, local
   food-producing systems, both marine and terrestrial, will be affected
   and the risk of malnutrition, especially in children, will increase.
   These impacts on health and livelihood are expected to be significant
   factors in the spread of regional social crises, potentially leading to
   forced migration, conflicts and increased poverty.
   The link between health and climate change operates through a variety of
   pathways that are now well established. In addition to taking climate
   mitigation measures, it will also be necessary to take adaptation
   measures, such as strengthening health systems, improving preparedness
   and developing early warning systems. There is now a broad scientific
   consensus on the issue and the science is sufficiently robust to enable
   a coordinated response to meet this global challenge.},

Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},

Abstract = {This data article relates to and complement the research paper:
   ``Assessment of climate change mitigation policies in 315 cities in the
   Covenant of Mayors initiative{''} {[}I]. The reported data has been
   collected and elaborated within the framework of the Covenant of Mayors
   (CoM) initiative. The dataset is extracted from the overall database of
   the initiative reported through the platform MyCovenant. The data deals
   with the Monitoring Emission Inventories submitted by local authorities
   by 2016. Data has been processed and elaborated to highlights specific
   features of signatories and the policies they have adopted in the
   development of their Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP). Available
   data relates to the mitigation policies in the SEAPs and includes their
   carbon reduction potential, the status of implementation and the class
   of governance. The CoM gathers together thousands of local authorities
   who voluntary committed to decarbonisation and increase resilience in
   their territory. Therefore, this data can be of interest for local
   policy makers and urban planners to identify successful examples in
   cities with comparable contexts and to identify possible measures in
   several sectors for climate change mitigation. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {Sea-level rise due to anthropogenic climate change is projected not only
   to exacerbate extreme events such as cyclones and storms but also to
   cause more frequent chronic flooding occurring at high tides under calm
   weather conditions. Chronic flooding occasionally takes place today in
   the low-lying areas of the Petit Cul-de-sac marin (Guadeloupe, West
   Indies, French Antilles). This area includes critical industrial and
   harbor and major economic infrastructures for the islands. As sea level
   rises, concerns are growing regarding the possibility of repeated
   chronic flooding events, which would alter the operations at these
   critical coastal infrastructures without appropriate adaptation. Here,
   we use information on past and future sea levels, vertical ground
   motion, and tides to assess times of emergence of chronic flooding in
   the Petit Cul-de-sac marin. For RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration
   Pathway 8.5; i.e., continued growth of greenhouse gas emissions), the
   number of flood days is projected to increase rapidly after the
   emergence of the process so that coastal sites will be flooded 180 d a
   year within 2 decades of the onset of chronic flooding. For coastal
   locations with the lowest altitude, we show that the reconstructed
   number of floods is consistent with observations known from a previous
   survey. Vertical ground motions are a key source of uncertainty in our
   projections. Yet, our satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar
   results show that the local variability in this subsidence is smaller
   than the uncertainties in the technique, which we estimate to be between
   1 (standard deviation of measurements) and 5 mm/yr (upper theoretical
   bound). Despite these uncertainties, our results imply that adaptation
   pathways considering a rapid increase in recurrent chronic flooding are
   required for the critical port and industrial and commercial center of
   Guadeloupe. Similar processes are expected to take place in many
   low-elevation coastal zones worldwide, including on other tropical
   islands. The method used in this study can be applied to other
   locations, provided tide gauge records and local knowledge of vertical
   ground motions are available. We argue that identifying times of
   emergence of chronic flooding events is urgently needed in most
   low-lying coastal areas, because adaptation requires decades to be
   implemented, whereas chronic flooding hazards can worsen drastically
   within years of the first event being observed.},

Abstract = {As climate adaptation gains international prominence as one means for
   addressing climate change, it remains critical that just and equitable
   outcomes are maintained as adaptation technologies are deployed across
   various target populations. In this vein, subjectivity has been
   problematized by climate change adaptation scholars as a concept that
   needs further attention to understand the political nature of climate
   change adaptation. Extending frameworks of environmentality to cases of
   climate change adaptation, we engage the term adaptation subjects to
   distinguish individuals whose interests and desires align with broader
   understandings and goals of climate change adaptation. In this research,
   we situate the co-production of livelihoods and climate change
   adaptation interventions as projects of rule to understand
   subject-formation. Such an analysis allows for a move beyond
   econocentric framings of livelihoods that privilege material outcomes to
   also engage with the socio-political realities of these livelihoods and
   climate change adaptation more broadly. We apply the Livelihoods as
   Intimate Government approach to a case study of the Ada Sea Defense
   System in the Ada East District of the Volta River Delta of Ghana as a
   climate change adaptation project of rule, in order to illustrate the
   ways this adaptation technology discursively constructs (or not)
   different residents as adaptation subjects. Understanding the Ada Sea
   Defense System as a technology of adaptation constituted through
   socio-political practices has the potential to promote justice and
   equity when designing, implementing and evaluating such technologies in
   the future.},

   Scotia},
Journal = {CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN},
Abstract = {Climate change risks to coastal communities may overwhelm current
   management strategies. The emergence of nature-based solutions could
   provide alternative approaches for climate adaptation; however, studies
   on their public acceptability are limited. This research focuses on the
   human dimensions of nature-based coastal adaptation solutions. The
   research sought to understand the kind of environmental changes
   participants were experiencing in their coastal communities of Nova
   Scotia and what management responses they observed being taken, if any.
   Online focus groups were held with coastal property owners in Nova
   Scotia to understand how they assess coastal risks and four approaches
   to nature-based coastal adaptation: living shorelines, accommodation,
   retreat, and dyke realignment to make space for wetland restoration.
   Results revealed ongoing trust in traditional hard-line approaches, but
   also interest in knowing more about nature-based options. There was
   general support for living shorelines, albeit with scepticism; a concern
   that accommodation is just a ``band-aid{''} approach; resistance to
   retreat, despite general recognition of its future utility; and a lack
   of understanding of dyke realignment. The successful implementation of
   nature-based coastal adaptation approaches will require more evidence of
   their viability, better options for financing them, and engagement with
   communities around the best-fit alternatives for them.},

Title = {Salt intrusion adaptation measures for sustainable agricultural
   development under climate change effects: A case of Ca Mau Peninsula,
   Vietnam},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {88-100},
Abstract = {Purpose: The Ca Mau Peninsula, a sub-region of the Vietnamese Mekong
   Delta, plays an extremely important and decisive role in the country's
   food security. Due to the influence of complex hydrological regime,
   annual intrusion of sea water in the dry season has caused barriers and
   constraints for existing agricultural practices. However, the projection
   of saline simulation indicated that the occurrence of salt intrusion is
   likely further inland and severe intensity in the Hau River and coastal
   areas of the Ca Mau Peninsula in line with the rise of sea levels under
   climate change effects. This paper aims to propose mitigation and
   adaptation measures of salt tolerance for sustainable agricultural
   development in the Ca Mau Peninsula up to 2030 in accordance with
   projected scenarios of sea level rise.
   Methodology: The study inherited the results of forecasting salt
   intrusion in scenarios of sea level rise until 2030 by using the MIKE 11
   HD-AD model in a previous research of the authors, in order to suggest
   mitigation and adaptation measures against salt intrusion for
   agricultural activities in the Ca Mau Peninsula. The documents relating
   to salt tolerance of crops, state of irrigation structures and land use
   were also collected and analyzed to provide more information for better
   proposed solutions.
   Findings: The paper presents some feasible measures to mitigate and
   adapt salt intrusion as sea level rise under impacts of climate change
   including appropriate land use planning; reasonable shifts in
   agricultural practices, in particular in the selection of plants and
   crops which can be tolerant to various salt limits; applying advanced
   cultivation techniques such as less water irrigation practices of
   alternate wetting and drying and salt tolerance enhancement; and
   hard-engineered structures for salt prevention and freshwater conveyance
   in freshwater-scarce areas.
   Practical implications: The study will be very meaningful for local
   farmers in the Ca Mau Peninsula to develop agriculture sustainably,
   especially, the famers can select crops which are suitable with the salt
   concentrations or change land use and cultivation models for higher
   yields.
   Social implications: The measures proposed in this study will help to
   increase the efficiency of agricultural production toward a sustainable
   agriculture-based economy, which will bring sustainable livelihoods for
   farmers in the peninsula where agriculture and aquaculture are their
   main economic activities.
   Originality/value: Until now, mitigation and adaptation measures of salt
   intrusion in the Ca Mau Peninsula have not been perfected. They were
   suggested by general view only, and not based upon scientific evidences.
   This paper gives a system of solutions which were proposed based upon
   specific evaluation of current and future forecasted salt intrusion
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {Exploring adaptation pathways is an emerging approach for supporting
   decision making under uncertain changing conditions. An adaptation
   pathway is a sequence of policy actions to reach specified objectives.
   To develop adaptation pathways, interactions between environment and
   policy response need to be analysed over time for an ensemble of
   plausible futures. A fast, integrated model can facilitate this. Here,
   we describe the development and evaluation of such a model, an
   Integrated Assessment Metamodel (IAMM), to explore adaptation pathways
   in the Rhine delta for a decision problem currently faced by the Dutch
   Government. The theory-motivated metamodel is a simplified physically
   based model. Closed questions reflecting the required accuracy were used
   to evaluate the model's fitness. The results show that such a model fits
   the purpose of screening and ranking of policy options and pathways to
   support the strategic decision making. A complex model can subsequently
   be used to obtain more detailed information. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {Drivers of change and adaptation pathways of agricultural systems facing
   increased salinity intrusion in coastal areas of the Mekong and Red
   River deltas in Vietnam},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

Abstract = {Agricultural systems are increasingly considered complex adaptive
   systems. They are dependent on the integrated nature of biophysical and
   social sub-systems, continuously adapt to changing conditions and often
   display non-linear responses to various drivers of change at multiple
   scales. This research applied the lens of complex adaptive systems
   theory to analyze current and historical drivers of change and
   adaptation pathways of agricultural systems to increased salinity
   intrusion in coastal areas of the Red River and Mekong deltas in Vietnam
   since 1975, The analysis is based on 27 in-depth interviews with
   officials of local and national authorities as well as 198
   semi-structured interviews and 11 focus group discussions conducted with
   farmers along three salinity transects in both deltas in 2015-2016. The
   results show that a dynamic interplay and feedback of various drivers of
   change such as policy intervention, farmers' desire for profit
   maximization, changing salinity conditions, and technological
   development at different levels of the deltaic social-ecological system
   have shaped the changes and adaptations in agricultural systems over the
   last decades. In response to increased salinity intrusion, as
   exemplified by the historic salinity levels recorded in the Mekong Delta
   in 2015-2016, various adaptation options have been considered. These
   include adaptations that would lock-in agricultural production in
   particular systems or constrain changes in others, which is potentially
   problematic in light of the high uncertainty related to future changes.
   The study recognizes the need to apply both incremental and
   transformative changes and select adaptation pathways which allow for
   continuous change or that are reversible in order to avoid lock-ins and
   address future challenges. Additionally, attention should be drawn to
   interactions and feedbacks in future changes within and across
   adaptation pathways in order to prevent further increases in salinity
   intrusion and lock-in effects in agricultural systems within the deltas.},

Title = {A Participatory Approach to Evaluating Strategies for Forest Carbon
   Mitigation in British Columbia},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To be successful, actions for mitigating climate change in the forest
   and forest sector will not only need to be informed by the best
   available science, but will also require strong public and/or political
   acceptability. This paper presents the results of a novel
   analytical-deliberative engagement process that brings together
   stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples in participatory workshops in the
   interior and coastal regions of British Columbia (BC) to evaluate a set
   of potential forest carbon mitigation alternatives. In particular, this
   study examines what objectives are prioritized by stakeholders and
   Indigenous Peoples when discussing forest carbon mitigation in BC's
   forests, as well as the perceived effectiveness of, and levels of
   support for, six forest-based carbon mitigation strategies. We start by
   describing the methodological framework involving two series of
   workshops. We then describe the results from the first round of
   workshops where participants identified 11 objectives that can be
   classified into four categories: biophysical, economic, social, and
   procedural. Afterwards, we discuss the second series of workshops, which
   allowed participants to evaluate six climate change mitigation
   strategies against the objectives previously identified, and highlight
   geographical differences, if any, between BC's coastal and interior
   regions. Our results effectively illustrate the potential and efficacy
   of our novel methodology in informing a variety of stakeholders in
   different regions, and generating consistent results with a surprising
   degree of consensus on both key objectives and preference for mitigation
   alternatives. We conclude with policy recommendations on how to consider
   various management objectives during the design and implementation of
   forest carbon mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Co-Creating Climate Adaptation Pathways in Coastal Cities: A Practical
   Guide for Engaged Scholars and Urban Designers},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As the repercussions of climate change materialize, coastal cities are
   often at the forefront of experiencing environmental impacts like
   flooding and storm events. In addition, anthropogenic vulnerability
   drivers, like industrial activity in the near-shore environment, may
   accelerate shoreline erosion or nuisance flooding through the loss of
   natural shoreline buffers and increased ship traffic. This
   interdisciplinary study applied a participatory mixed-methods approach,
   co-creating climate change adaptation pathways with community and
   stakeholder input as a bottom-up task. The aims were to engage in a
   community dialogue (1) identifying assets and challenges within the
   natural and built environment based on community input, (2) utilizing a
   participatory mixed-methods approach to model and quantify selected
   hazards, and (3) transforming them into adaptation pathways visualized
   in a comprehensive master plan. The small-town of Ingleside on the Bay,
   Texas, served as a case study for this project, highlighting how
   sea-level rise and industrial activity challenge the community, its
   natural and cultural environment, and the infrastructure within. The
   outcomes identify anthropogenic vulnerability drivers and propose a
   concrete list of seven adaptation pathways based on community input.
   This study helps engaged scholars and decision-makers to activate
   community members and their knowledge as an integral component of their
   work, from identifying a problem to developing tangible solutions.},

Abstract = {Tourism in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is vulnerable to
   climate change. Using the Bahamas as a case study, this study presents
   findings from a survey administered with property managers from the
   coastal accommodations sector to identify their adaptation strategies to
   tackle climate change. We also evaluate their adaptive capacity by
   developing SIDS-specific indicators based on a capitals approach.
   Findings indicate that efforts toward adaptation were limited to
   disaster preparedness for hurricanes, reflecting a short-term focus in
   the face of climate change uncertainties. In addition to the lack of
   finances and knowledge for incorporating adaptation measures, their
   capacity to adapt is diminished due to a lack of access to climate
   change information, skilled staff, and specific climate change planning
   reflecting limited human and institutional capitals. Recommendations are
   provided for strategies synergistic with the resilience focus of our
   paper such as ecosystem-based adaptation and green jobs. The study
   informs tourism resilience and adaptation planning in the Bahamas which
   may apply to other SIDS.},

Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {The hydrological cycle has a significant impact on human activities and
   ecosystems, so understanding its mechanisms with respect to a changing
   climate is essential. In particular, a more detailed understanding of
   hydrological cycle response to transient climate change is required for
   successful adaptation and mitigation policies. In this study, we exploit
   large ensemble model experiments using the Community Earth System Model
   version 1.2.2 (CESM1) in which CO2 concentrations increase steadily and
   then decrease along the same path. Our results show that precipitation
   changes in the CO2 increasing and decreasing phases are nearly
   symmetrical over land but asymmetric over oceans. After CO2
   concentrations peak, the ocean continues to uptake heat from the
   atmosphere, which is a key process leading the hydrological cycles
   contrasting response over land and ocean. The symmetrical hydrological
   cycle response over land involves a complex interplay between rapid
   responses to CO2 and slower responses to ensuing warming. Therefore, the
   surface energy constraints lead to the contrasting hydrological response
   over land and ocean to CO2 forcing that needs to be verified and
   considered in climate change mitigation and adaption actions.},

Title = {Assessing tidal marsh resilience to sea-level rise at broad geographic

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {204},

Pages = {263-275},

Abstract = {Tidal marshes and the ecosystem services they provide may be at risk
   from sea-level rise (SLR). Tidal marsh resilience to SLR can vary due to
   differences in local rates of SLR, geomorphology, sediment availability
   and other factors. Understanding differences in resilience is critical
   to inform coastal management and policy, but comparing resilience across
   marshes is hindered by a lack of simple, effective analysis tools.
   Quantitative, multi-metric indices are widely employed to inform
   management of benthic aquatic ecosystems, but not coastal wetlands.
   Here, we develop and apply tidal marsh resilience to sea-level rise
   (MARS) indices incorporating ten metrics that contribute to overall
   marsh resilience to SLR. We applied MARS indices to tidal marshes at 16
   National Estuarine Research Reserves across the conterminous U.S. This
   assessment revealed moderate resilience overall, although nearly all
   marshes had some indication of risk. Pacific marshes were generally more
   resilient to SLR than Atlantic ones, with the least resilient marshes
   found in southern New England. We provide a calculation tool to
   facilitate application of the MARS indices to additional marshes. MARS
   index scores can inform the choice of the most appropriate coastal
   management strategy for a marsh: moderate scores call for actions to
   enhance resilience while low scores suggest investment may be better
   directed to adaptation strategies such as creating opportunities for
   marsh migration rather than attempting to save existing marshes. The
   MARS indices thus provide a powerful new approach to evaluate tidal
   marsh resilience and to inform development of adaptation strategies in
   the face of SLR. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Identifying effective adaptation strategies for coastal communities
   dependent on marine resources and impacted by climate change can be
   difficult due to the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems. The task is
   more difficult if current and predicted shifts in social and economic
   trends are considered. Information about social and economic change is
   often limited to qualitative data. A combination of qualitative and
   quantitative models provide the flexibility to allow the assessment of
   current and future ecological and socio-economic risks and can provide
   information on alternative adaptations. Here, we demonstrate how
   stakeholder input, qualitative models and Bayesian belief networks
   (BBNs) can provide semi-quantitative predictions, including uncertainty
   levels, for the assessment of climate and non-climate-driven change in a
   case study community. Issues are identified, including the need to
   increase the capacity of the community to cope with change. Adaptation
   strategies are identified that alter positive feedback cycles
   contributing to a continued decline in population, local employment and
   retail spending. For instance, the diversification of employment
   opportunities and the attraction of new residents of different ages
   would be beneficial in preventing further population decline. Some
   impacts of climate change can be combated through recreational bag or
   size limits and monitoring of popular range-shifted species that are
   currently unmanaged, to reduce the potential for excessive removal. Our
   results also demonstrate that combining BBNs and qualitative models can
   assist with the effective communication of information between
   stakeholders and researchers. Furthermore, the combination of techniques
   provides a dynamic, learning-based, semi-quantitative approach for the
   assessment of climate and socio-economic impacts and the identification
   of potential adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the biggest and most urgent challenges for the
   21st century. Rising average temperatures and ocean levels, altered
   precipitation patterns and increased occurrence of extreme weather
   events affect not only the global landscape and ecosystem, but also
   human health. Multiple environmental factors influence the onset and
   severity of human diseases and changing climate may have a great impact
   on these factors. Climate shifts disrupt the quantity and quality of
   water, increase environmental pollution, change the distribution of
   pathogens and severely impacts food production - all of which are
   important regarding public health. This paper focuses on brain health
   and provides an overview of climate change impacts on risk factors
   specific to brain diseases and disorders. We also discuss emerging
   hazards in brain health due to mitigation and adaptation strategies in

Title = {A Re-evaluation of Wetland Carbon Sink Mitigation Concepts and
   Measurements: A Diagenetic Solution},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The capacity of wetlands to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is
   the sum of two services: the protection of vulnerable organic stocks
   from remineralisation, and the capacity to sequester GHGs relative to
   their anthropogenic replacements. Organic carbon accumulation (CA) down
   through the sediment column is often taken as the measure of
   sequestration because of its capacity to record long-term variability
   and trends. However, we demonstrate that: i) CA is not equivalent to
   sequestration as net ecosystem production (NEP) for open systems; it
   requires the subtraction of the initial deposition rate of labile
   allochthonous carbon sources; ii) CA also requires subtraction of
   intrinsically allochthonous recalcitrants down through the sediment
   column, and together with subtraction of autochthonous recalcitrants
   from organic stock services; iii) CA as a climatic mitigation service
   also requires a diagenetic correction, as the annual deposition of
   labile organic carbon continues to remineralise over the long-term; and
   iv) preserving of a wetland has a significantly greater mitigation
   potential than restoring one. To address the above concerns, a global
   diagenetic solution is proposed, applied and tested for a tropical
   seagrass and mangrove. As expected, traditional CA estimates were
   disproportionately larger than their respective diagenetically modelled
   NEPs, and together with stocks fell within the ranges reported in the
   literature, with a final carbon accreditation highly dependent on the
   choice of their anthropogenic replacements. The review demonstrates that
   mitigation concepts and measurements for natural carbon sequestration
   solutions require re-evaluation to avoid GHG emissions above their
   capacity or reduce the ability to fulfil emission targets.},

Title = {Targeted implementation of cool roofs for equitable urban adaptation to
   extreme heat},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {811},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Cities are facing the twin pressures of greenhouse gas driven climatic
   warming and locally induced urban heating. These pressures are
   threatening populations that are sensitive to extreme heat due to
   sociodemographic factors including economic means. Heat-reducing
   infrastructure adaptation measures such as reflective ``cool{''}
   materials can reduce urban temperatures. Here we examine the needs-based
   equity implications associated with heat reducing cool roofing in
   Maricopa County, Arizona through application of high-resolution
   urban-atmospheric simulations. We simulate heatwave conditions and
   evaluate the air temperature reduction arising from uniform cool roof
   implementation (i.e., the entire urbanized county), and contrast results
   against simulated cooling impacts of needs-based targeted cool roof
   implementation in sociodemographically heat sensitive areas. We find
   that installing cool roofs uniformly, rather than in a targeted fashion,
   provides on average 0.66 degrees C reduction in the highest heat
   sensitivity area and 0.39 degrees C temperature reduction in the lowest
   heat sensitivity area due in part to a higher roof area density in the
   heat sensitive area. Targeting cool roof implementation yields 0.45
   degrees C cooling in the most sensitive areas compared to 0.22 degrees C
   cooling in the least sensitive areas, meaning that needs-based targeted
   cool roofs in high sensitivity areas provide more relief than cool roofs
   targeted at low sensitivity areas, thus providing more cooling where it
   is most needed. Needs-based targeted implementation has the dual
   benefits of concurrently producing more than twice as much cooling and
   reducing heat exposure for the largest absolute number of individuals in
   the densely populated, highly heat sensitive areas. Targeting cool roof
   implementation to high heat sensitivity areas, however, does not achieve
   thermally equal temperatures in Maricopa County because the high
   sensitivity areas were substantially warmer than low sensitivity areas
   prior to implementation. This study illustrates the utility of a new
   ``Targeted Urban Heat Adaptation{''} (TUHA) framework to assess
   needs-based equity implications of heat-reducing strategies and
   underscores its importance by examining the impacts of cooling
   interventions across sociodemographically heterogeneous urban
   environments. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {How does framing affect policy support for emissions mitigation? Testing
   the effects of ocean acidification and other carbon emissions frames},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {63-78},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Public support for carbon emissions mitigation is crucial to motivate
   action to address global issues like climate change and ocean
   acidification (OA). Yet in the public sphere, carbon emissions
   mitigation policies are typically discussed in the context of climate
   change and rarely in the context of OA or other global change outcomes.
   In this paper, we advance research on OA and climate change perceptions
   and communication, by (i) examining causal beliefs about ocean
   acidification, and (ii) measuring support for mitigation policies from
   individuals presented with one of five different policy frames (climate
   change, global warming, carbon pollution, air pollution, and ocean
   acidification). Knowledge about OA causes and consequences is more
   widespread than we anticipated, though still generally low. Somewhat
   surprisingly, an ``air pollution{''} mitigation frame elicits the
   highest degree of policy support overall, while ``carbon pollution{''}
   performs no better than ``climate change{''} or ``global warming.{''}
   Framing effects are in part contingent on prior knowledge and attitudes,
   and mediated by concern. Perhaps due to a lack of OA awareness, the OA
   frame generates the least support overall, although it seems to close
   the gap in support associated with political orientation: the OA frame
   increases support among those (few) conservatives who report having
   heard of OA before the survey. These findings complement previous work
   on climate change communication and suggest the need for further
   research into OA as an effective way to engage conservatives in carbon
   emissions mitigation policy. Potentially even more promising is the air
   pollution framing.},

Title = {Mini-review: Assessing the drivers of ship biofouling management -
   aligning industry and biosecurity goals},
Journal = {BIOFOULING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {411-428},
Abstract = {Biofouling exerts a frictional and cost penalty on ships and is a direct
   cause of invasion by marine species. These negative consequences provide
   a unifying purpose for the maritime industry and biosecurity managers to
   prevent biofouling accumulation and transfer, but important gaps exist
   between these sectors. This mini-review examines the approach to
   assessments of ship biofouling among sectors (industry, biosecurity and
   marine science) and the implications for existing and emerging
   management of biofouling. The primary distinctions between industry and
   biosecurity in assessment of vessels biofouling revolve around the
   resolution of biological information collected and the specific wetted
   surface areas of primary concern to each sector. The morphological
   characteristics of biofouling and their effects on propulsion dynamics
   are of primary concern to industry, with an almost exclusive focus on
   the vertical sides and flat bottom of hulls and an emphasis on
   antifouling and operational performance. In contrast, the identity,
   biogeography, and ecology of translocated organisms is of highest
   concern to invasion researchers and biosecurity managers and
   policymakers, especially as it relates to species with known histories
   of invasion elsewhere. Current management practices often provide
   adequate, although not complete, provision for hull surfaces, but niche
   areas are well known to enhance biosecurity risk. As regulations to
   prevent invasions emerge in this arena, there is a growing opportunity
   for industry, biosecurity and academic stakeholders to collaborate and
   harmonize efforts to assess and manage biofouling of ships that should
   lead to more comprehensive biofouling solutions that promote industry
   goals while reducing biosecurity risk and greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Climate change policy responses for Canada's Inuit population: The
   importance of and opportunities for adaptation},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {177-191},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We identify and examine how policy intervention can help Canada's Inuit
   population adapt to climate change. The policy responses are based on an
   understanding of the determinants of vulnerability identified in
   research conducted with 15 Inuit communities. A consistent approach was
   used in each case study where vulnerability is conceptualized as a
   function of exposure-sensitivity to climatic risks and adaptive capacity
   to deal with those risks. This conceptualization focuses on the
   biophysical and human determinants of vulnerability and how they are
   influenced by processes and conditions operating at multiple
   spatial-temporal scales. Case studies involved close collaboration with
   community members and policy makers to identify conditions to which each
   community is currently vulnerable, characterize the factors that shape
   vulnerability and how they have changed over time, identify
   opportunities for adaptation policy, and examine how adaptation can be
   mainstreamed. Fieldwork, conducted between 2006 and 2009, included 443
   semi-structured interviews, 20 focus groups/community workshops, and 65
   interviews with policy makers at local, regional, and national levels.
   Synthesizing findings consistent across the case studies we document
   significant vulnerabilities, a function of socio-economic stresses and
   change, continuing and pervasive inequality, and magnitude of climate
   change. Nevertheless, adaptations are available, feasible, and Inuit
   have considerable adaptive capacity. Realizing this adaptive capacity
   and overcoming adaptation barriers requires policy intervention to: (i)
   support the teaching and transmission of environmental knowledge and
   land skills, (ii) enhance and review emergency management capability,
   (iii) ensure the flexibility of resource management regimes, (iv)
   provide economic support to facilitate adaptation for groups with
   limited household income, (v) increase research effort to identify short
   and long term risk factors and adaptive response options, (vi) protect
   key infrastructure, and (vii) promote awareness of climate change
   impacts and adaptation among policy makers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Review},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The management of civil infrastructure, including the allocation of
   scarce resources, is an engineering issue that now must also consider
   the highly politicized, highly debated hazard of climate change.
   Bridges, in particular, are increasingly vulnerable to damage as a
   result of the sea level rise, increasingly intense precipitation, and
   increasingly intense hurricanes that accompany climate change. This
   review paper focuses on the current challenges facing bridge owners and
   managers as a result of anthropogenic and natural climate changes. The
   complexities of the climate change are discussed and the current state
   of research regarding the direct relationship to anthropogenic climate
   changes, as well as natural climate patterns, is presented. Potential
   adaptation measures are outlined for repair and retrofit measures that
   may help mitigate the negative impact of climate change. Methodologies
   for planning under uncertainty, including stochastic and robust
   optimization methods, are discussed with respect to bridge management
   under climate change. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Can ``Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA){''} adapt to climate

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {120-131},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The coastal aquaculture sector in Bangladesh is dominated by
   export-oriented freshwater prawn and saltwater shrimp farming. However,
   the culture of prawn and shrimp in coastal Bangladesh has been
   accompanied by recent concerns over climate change. Different climatic
   variables, including cyclone, drought, flood, rainfall, salinity, sea
   level rise, and sea surface temperature have had adverse effects on
   prawn and shrimp production. Considering vulnerability to the effects of
   climate change on coastal aquaculture, one of the adaptation strategies
   is ``Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA){''}. Open water IMTA in
   coastal Bangladesh would be a novel process of growing different finfish
   and shellfish with seaweeds in an integrated farm. IMTA is considered an
   ecosystem approach adaptation strategy to climate change which could
   generate environmental and economic benefits. We suggest institutional
   support to facilitate IMTA in coastal Bangladesh. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},

Abstract = {Adaptation of remote island communities in the Russian European Arctic
   to dramatic socioeconomic changes has been intensified by the impacts of
   climate changes in navigation seasons. Both the stability and duration
   of winter and summer navigation seasons and the start of
   therasputitsaseason, a shoulder period between the first two, are
   becoming more unpredictable and jeopardizing local mobility options. The
   ability to commute between neighboring settlements is an important
   aspect of island communities' viability. Local mobility depends on
   well-functioning ice roads during wintertime, tugboats during
   theraputitsaseason and on passenger vessels or smaller boats during
   summer navigation. To examine whether and how the island population of
   the Arkhangelsk region adapts to changing conditions and what factors
   shape adaptation options, we apply a community-based adaptation
   approach. The results from qualitative interviews with 32 residents and
   relevant stakeholders indicate that further development of the island
   communities will rely on sufficient mobility options. Incorporation of
   climate prognoses and local knowledge can improve the planning of
   mobility measures. Current and future community adaptation is challenged
   by out-migration, unpredictability in therasputitsaseason and lack of
   investment in island development.},

   Addressing Diffuse Threats and Developing Rigorous Adaptive Management
   Plans},

Abstract = {We discuss the importance of addressing diffuse threats to long-term
   species and habitat viability in fish conservation and recovery
   planning. In the Pacific Northwest, USA, salmonid management plans have
   typically focused on degraded freshwater habitat, dams, fish passage,
   harvest rates, and hatchery releases. However, such plans inadequately
   address threats related to human population and economic growth,
   intra-and interspecific competition, and changes in climate, ocean, and
   estuarine conditions. Based on reviews conducted on eight conservation
   and/or recovery plans, we found that though threats resulting from such
   changes are difficult to model and/or predict, they are especially
   important for wide-ranging diadromous species. Adaptive management is
   also a critical but often inadequately constructed component of those
   plans. Adaptive management should be designed to respond to evolving
   knowledge about the fish and their supporting ecosystems; if done
   properly, it should help improve conservation efforts by decreasing
   uncertainty regarding known and diffuse threats. We conclude with a
   general call for environmental managers and planners to reinvigorate the
   adaptive management process in future management plans, including more
   explicitly identifying critical uncertainties, implementing monitoring
   programs to reduce those uncertainties, and explicitly stating what
   management actions will occur when pre-identified trigger points are
   reached.},

Title = {Exploring Long Term Spatial Vegetation Trends in Taiwan from AVHRR
   NDVI3g Dataset Using RDA and HCA Analyses},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to 4000 m elevation variation with temperature differences
   equivalent to 50 degrees of latitudinal gradient, exploring Taiwan's
   spatial vegetation trends is valuable in terms of diverse ecosystems and
   climatic types covering a relatively small island with an area of 36,000
   km(2). This study analyzed Taiwan's spatial vegetation trends with
   controlling environmental variables through redundancy (RDA) and
   hierarchical cluster (HCA) analyses over three decades (1982-2012) of
   monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI3g data for 19
   selected weather stations over the island. Results showed two spatially
   distinct vegetation response groups. Group 1 comprises weather stations
   which remained relatively natural showing a slight increasing NDVI
   tendency accompanied with rising temperature, whereas Group 2 comprises
   stations with high level of human development showing a slight
   decreasing NDVI tendency associated with increasing temperature-induced
   moisture stress. Statistically significant controlling variables include
   climatic factors (temperature and precipitation), orographic factors
   (mean slope and aspects), and anthropogenic factor (population density).
   Given the potential trajectories for future warming, variable
   precipitation, and population pressure, challenges, such as land-cover
   and water-induced vegetation stress, need to be considered
   simultaneously for establishing adequate adaptation strategies to combat
   climate change challenges in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {Global warming-induced climate change affects the coastal regions
   diversely leading to warmer oceans, rise in sea level, aggravating storm
   patterns, inundations, increasing precipitations and salinization. This
   study focusses to explore the livelihood as well as the vulnerability
   status of the marine fishing spatial units in Sindhudurg Coastal and
   Marine Ecosystem (SCME) area, west coast of India. The focus was to
   develop a composite index, namely, Sustainable Fisheries Livelihood
   Index (SFLI) comprising five capitals, which acts as a tool to evaluate
   the livelihood status of the fishing communities and also a coastal
   vulnerability (Cumulative Vulnerability Index-CVI) framework from an
   earlier assessment was used. The livelihood and vulnerability indices
   were integrated to arrive at a decision-making matrix to identify and
   propose suitable interventions for appropriate climate adaptation
   strategies and achieving sustainable fisheries livelihood. In the
   present study, SCME was found to have a low SFLI value (0.36). Among the
   three taluks in SCME, Malvan taluk had comparatively higher SFLI (0.46)
   than Vengurla (0.34) and Devgad (0.29) taluks. Based on cumulative
   vulnerability indices, the majority of marine fishing spatial units
   (i.e. 58.3\% after combining high and very high CVI ranges) in SCME were
   found to face severe vulnerability. These spatial units, plotted using
   CVI versus SFLI in the four quadrants of decision matrix, were analyzed
   for management interventions with strategies aimed at reducing the
   vulnerability and improve the adaptive capacity of fishing communities
   to achieve sustainable livelihoods. Spatial units in Quadrant IV were
   preferred to have focused climate change adaptation strategies to
   minimize vulnerability as well as to improve the fisheries livelihood
   sustainability by enhancing the access to livelihood capital assets.
   Spatial units in Quadrant I might serve as model units to demonstrate
   the vulnerability mitigation interventions to achieve stability and
   sustainability of livelihoods. Appropriate interventions for climate
   change adaptation such as diversification of fishing, selection of
   appropriate fishing gears, regulation of fishing effort, diversification
   of livelihoods and adoption of ecosystem approach to fisheries
   management (EAFM) have been discussed.},

Title = {Vulnerability of the oil and gas sector to climate change and extreme
   weather events},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {121},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {41-53},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A changing climate and more frequent extreme weather events pose
   challenges to the oil and gas sector. Identifying how these changes will
   affect oil and gas extraction, transportation, processing, and delivery,
   and how these industries can adapt to or mitigate any adverse impacts
   will be vital to this sector's supply security. This work presents an
   overview of the sector's vulnerability to a changing climate. It
   addresses the potential for Natech hazards and proposes risk reduction
   measures, including mitigation and adaptation options. Assessment
   frameworks to ensure the safety of people, the environment, and
   investments in the oil and gas sector in the face of climate change are
   presented and their limitations discussed. It is argued that a
   comprehensive and systemic analysis framework for risk assessment is
   needed. The paper concludes that climate change and extreme weather
   events represent a real physical threat to the oil and gas sector,
   particularly in low-lying coastal areas and areas exposed to extreme
   weather events. The sector needs to take climate change seriously,
   assess its own vulnerability, and take appropriate measures to prevent
   or mitigate any potentially negative effects.},

Title = {The dynamics of architectural complexity on coral reefs under climate
   change},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {223-235},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {One striking feature of coral reef ecosystems is the complex benthic
   architecture which supports diverse and abundant fauna, particularly of
   reef fish. Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide, with a
   corresponding loss of live coral cover resulting in a loss of
   architectural complexity. Understanding the dynamics of the reef
   architecture is therefore important to envision the ability of corals to
   maintain functional habitats in an era of climate change. Here, we
   develop a mechanistic model of reef topographical complexity for
   contemporary Caribbean reefs. The model describes the dynamics of corals
   and other benthic taxa under climate-driven disturbances (hurricanes and
   coral bleaching). Corals have a simplified shape with explicit diameter
   and height, allowing species-specific calculation of their colony
   surface and volume. Growth and the mechanical (hurricanes) and
   biological erosion (parrotfish) of carbonate skeletons are important in
   driving the pace of extension/reduction in the upper reef surface, the
   net outcome being quantified by a simple surface roughness index (reef
   rugosity). The model accurately simulated the decadal changes of coral
   cover observed in Cozumel (Mexico) between 1984 and 2008, and provided a
   realistic hindcast of coral colony-scale (1-10m) changing rugosity over
   the same period. We then projected future changes of Caribbean reef
   rugosity in response to global warming. Under severe and frequent
   thermal stress, the model predicted a dramatic loss of rugosity over the
   next two or three decades. Critically, reefs with managed parrotfish
   populations were able to delay the general loss of architectural
   complexity, as the benefits of grazing in maintaining living coral
   outweighed the bioerosion of dead coral skeletons. Overall, this model
   provides the first explicit projections of reef rugosity in a warming
   climate, and highlights the need of combining local (protecting and
   restoring high grazing) to global (mitigation of greenhouse gas
   emissions) interventions for the persistence of functional reef
   habitats.},

Abstract = {Relative to the northern hemisphere, little is known about the effect of
   climate change on southern hemisphere birds, although the impact could
   be significant. Here we review the effects of climate change on birds
   that have been documented or predicted, with particular reference to
   Australian species. Potential impacts include changes in geographic
   range, movement patterns, morphology, physiology, abundance, phenology
   and community composition. The evidence suggests that these changes are
   already happening, both overseas and in Australia, but more research is
   needed to determine the extent of these impacts and how to conserve
   birds in the face of climate change. Management options include
   promoting adaptation and resilience, intensive management of sensitive
   species, and improved planning for mitigation techniques and monitoring.},

Title = {Effective coastal adaptation needs accurate hazard assessment: a case
   study in Port Resolution, Tanna Island Vanuatu},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Abstract = {Developing countries face risks from coastal hazards that are being
   amplified by climate change. The selection of effective adaptation
   interventions to manage these risks requires a sufficiently accurate
   assessment of the coastal hazard at a given location. Yet challenges
   remain in terms of understanding local coastal risks given the
   coarseness of global wave models and the paucity of locally scaled data
   in most developing countries, including Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS) like Vanuatu. This paper aims to examine the differences in
   hazard assessment and adaptation option selections arising from analyses
   using globally versus locally scaled data on coastal processes. As a
   case study, we focused on an eroding cliff face in Port Resolution on
   Tanna Island, Vanuatu, which is of concern to the local community and
   government authorities. The coastal process modeling revealed that the
   global wave data generated unrealistically high predictions of wave
   height within Port Resolution Bay. Expensive engineering adaptations
   designed to provide coastal protection were therefore likely to fail in
   preventing ongoing cliff erosion. In this case, the best adaptation
   solution involves changing land use to revegetate and help stabilize the
   cliff top. Our case study highlights the importance of accurate hazard
   assessment, especially in data-poor regions where the extrapolation of
   global datasets and models in the absence of local data can result in
   poor adaptation decision-making. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary
   approach applied here can be applied in other data-poor regions to
   strengthen analyses exploring the benefits of local adaptation
   interventions.},

Title = {Theorizing the resilience district: Design-based decision making for
   coastal climate change adaptation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-17},
Abstract = {Today, coastal cities face mounting pressures to plan for increased
   exposure to chronic flooding, and ultimately significant sea level rise.
   The required investments in urban adaptation are inherently expensive,
   uncertain and long-term. These factors pose significant challenges for
   both effective choice and collective action. This paper argues that
   metropolitan `resilience districts' offer the appropriate
   decision-making unit (DMU) to analyze, plan and implement resilience
   strategies. The working concept of `resilience districts' for urban
   areas vulnerable to coastal flooding was first coined by a design team
   at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spurred by a case study on
   the New Jersey Meadowlands from the `Rebuild By Design' (RBD)
   competition. Cities have since begun using this term for their own
   resilience policies, failing to recognize the original intentions of its
   meaning. This analysis details a resilience districting strategy for the
   Greater Boston Metropolitan Area. The research culminates with a
   generalizable urban planning and design framework for protecting
   critical infrastructure, `thickening' regional soft systems and
   transferring density to less vulnerable areas. The overall theme
   emphasizes landscape as a critical public safety service.},

Abstract = {The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta enables Bangladesh to sustain a dense
   population, but it also exposes people to natural hazards. This article
   presents findings from the Gibika project, which researches livelihood
   resilience in seven study sites across Bangladesh. This study aims to
   understand how people in the study sites build resilience against
   environmental stresses, such as cyclones, floods, riverbank erosion, and
   drought, and in what ways their strategies sometimes fail. The article
   applies a new methodology for studying people's decision making in
   risk-prone environments: the personal Livelihood History interviews (N =
   28). The findings show how environmental stress, shocks, and
   disturbances affect people's livelihood resilience and why adaptation
   measures can be unsuccessful. Floods, riverbank erosion, and droughts
   cause damage to agricultural lands, crops, houses, and properties.
   People manage to adapt by modifying their agricultural practices,
   switching to alternative livelihoods, or using migration as an adaptive
   strategy. In the coastal study sites, cyclones are a severe hazard. The
   study reveals that when a cyclone approaches, people sometimes choose
   not to evacuate: they put their lives at risk to protect their
   livelihoods and properties. Future policy and adaptation planning must
   use lessons learned from people currently facing environmental stress
   and shocks.},

Abstract = {Many urban centers are at risk of heat wave events. These events are
   exacerbated in urban environments by the urban heat island effect (UHI)
   which is the built environment's characteristic to store heat during the
   day and release it at night time, thus increasing the temperature. This
   study takes stock of UHI effect and evaluates the integration of
   mitigation measures with land use planning in two large cities of
   Canada, namely Montr,al and Toronto. The two cities have been chosen
   because they have put in place active mitigation measures through a hot
   weather response plan in response to recent events of heat waves. The
   premise was that because the UHI effect is a built environment's
   characteristic, it is possible to modify the built environment in order
   to reduce heat storage. Usually, local land use plans provide cities
   with development and redevelopment guidelines, implementation measures,
   and policies to be considered. The study also discusses most commonly
   used mitigation strategies and measures and their effectiveness.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recent global warming has caused significant changes to the regional
   climate over Eastern Canada and brought unprecedented challenges to the
   local communities, such as rising sea level, shrinking sea ice coverage,
   increasing coastal and inland floods, accelerated coastal erosion, and
   so on. Although local governments have declared climate emergency in
   recent years, there is still a lack of real climate actions due to the
   poor understanding of the future climatic changes over Eastern Canada
   and how to mitigate and adapt to those changes from a long-term
   perspective. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing
   high-resolution regional climate scenarios for Eastern Canada throughout
   the twenty-first century under three greenhouse gases emission scenarios
   (RCP2.6-low, RCP4.5-medium, and RCP8.5-high). The results suggest that
   the low-emission scenario of RCP2.6 would potentially stabilize the
   regional climate (i.e., no significant changes in both temperature and
   precipitation) over Eastern Canada after the continuous warming reaches
   its peak in the middle of this century. However, an average warming
   about 1 degrees C would still be expected from now to the end of this
   century under RCP2.6, highlighting the importance of preparing for a new
   climate normal even though strict carbon reduction efforts could be made
   before 2050. In comparison, both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios would lead
   to a continuous warming over Eastern Canada with increased total
   precipitation throughout this century. Most importantly, the warming
   trend under RCP8.5 is likely to accelerate after 2050, which would
   potentially cause significant shifts in the precipitation seasonality
   and bring more climate extremes, such as droughts in August, increasing
   spring and fall floods, more freezing rains between fall and winter, and
   more heavy snowfalls in winter. The results from this study can help the
   local policy makers understand the importance and scientific
   implications of taking immediate carbon reduction actions and developing
   long-term climate adaptation plans.},

Abstract = {Potential for, and limits to, adaptation to environmental changes are
   critical for resilience and risk mitigation. The Mediterranean basin is
   a mosaic of biodiversity-rich ecosystems long affected by human
   influence, whose resilience is now questioned by climate change. After
   reviewing the different components of biological adaptation, we present
   the main characteristics of marine and terrestrial biodiversity in the
   Mediterranean basin and of the pressures they face. Taking climatic
   trends into consideration, we discuss the adaptive potential of a range
   of ecosystems dominated by species without active dispersal. We argue
   that the high heterogeneity of Mediterranean landscapes and seascapes
   constitutes a laboratory for the study of adaptation when environmental
   conditions change rapidly and may provide opportunities for adaptation
   and adaptability of species and ecosystems. Adaptive management in the
   Mediterranean can and should harness the nature-based solutions offered
   by both ecological and evolutionary processes for increasing the
   resilience of ecosystems to climate change.},

Title = {Salinity-induced concomitant increases in soil ammonia volatilization
   and nitrous oxide emission},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {361},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Environmental concerns about the release of reactive nitrogen (N) from
   intensively fertilized farmland are growing, especially regarding
   gaseous N losses in the form of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O).
   While saline soils are widely distributed and gradually expanding
   worldwide, the effect of soil salinity on soil NH3 and N2O emissions is
   poorly understood. To assess the effect of soil salinity levels on NH3
   volatilization and N2O emissions, a field experiment was conducted with
   three soil salinity levels (SO = non-saline, S1 = 1.0 dS m (-1) and S2 =
   5.0 dS m(-1)) and two N fertilizer types (urea and ammonium sulphate).
   Compared to the non-saline soil, S1 and S2 salinity levels both led to
   significant increases in cumulative NH3 volatilization losses by
   40.0\%-65.2\% and 89.0\%-92.2\%, respectively (p < 0.05). Following the
   application of either urea and ammonium sulphate, N2O emissions at the
   51 salinity level were significantly greater than those at both S0 and
   S2 salinity levels (p < 0.05). The correlation showed that the NH3 flux
   was an exponential function with respect to soil ammonium (NH4+ -N)
   concentration (R-2 = 0.766, p < 0.05), and the N2O flux displayed a
   linear relationship with soil nitrite (NO2- -N) concentration (R-2 =
   0.816, p < 0.05) which was accumulated to a much greater degree under
   the S1 salinity level. Saline soil's promotion of NH3 volatilization was
   a result from urea hydrolysis, nitrification and soil NH4+ -N adsorption
   capacity being suppressed under elevated soil salinity. Increased N2O
   emissions were ascribed to the accumulation of soil NO2-N caused by the
   imbalance of salinity's inhibition on nitrite oxidation and ammonia
   oxidation. This study indicates that saline soils have a considerable
   potential to simultaneously increase NH3 and N2O emissions, so
   mitigation options should be explored when cultivating saline soils.},

Abstract = {Perceptions of coastal hazards and risks and support for mitigation
   strategies among three different stakeholder groups (experts,
   businesses, and community members) are compared and analyzed in Waikiki,
   Hawaii. A justification for research on Waikiki, a world renown tourist
   destination and its relevance to other coastal communities is provided.
   It is shown that the three groups perceive risks, such as hurricanes,
   storm surge, erosion, tsunamis, and other natural and man-made hazards,
   differently which in turn influences support for mitigation strategies
   such as sea walls, beach nourishment, elevating or relocating at-risk
   structures and the preferences as to who should pay for risk reduction
   strategies. Data were analyzed using basic inferential statistics, GLM
   regression and correspondence analysis. Correspondence analysis is a
   novel technique for studying the relationships between stakeholder
   attributes (demographic, political, etc.) and the level of support for
   coastal interventions. The implications for researchers, engineers and
   coastal planners working in at-risk coastal communities are described.},

Title = {Economic Impact of Overtopping and Adaptation Measures in Catalan Ports
   Due to Sea Level Rise},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper, the impact of sea level rise (SLR) throughout the 21st
   century in the overtopping of port breakwaters is analyzed at a regional
   scale, focusing on the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean). The study is
   made considering three scenarios of SLR and two levels of storminess,
   computing the overtopping discharges in 47 ports to assess those
   exceeding a tolerable threshold and to roughly estimate the monetary
   value of the consequences of such discharges. Possible adaptation
   measures are examined, selecting the most cost-effective and assessing
   the cost of its implementation for the different scenarios and two
   damage levels. Results show that, as it could be expected, the number of
   ports affected by overtopping will increase with SLR, as well as the
   economic impact. Another remarkable finding of this paper is the
   significant savings in adaptation measures achieved allowing a minimum
   level of damage in contrast to the zero-damage option.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate buffer infrastructure is on the rise as a promising `green'
   climate adaptation strategy. More often than not, such infrastructure
   building is legitimized as an urgent technical intervention-while less
   attention is paid to the distribution of costs and benefits among the
   affected population. However, as this article shows, adaptation
   interventions may directly or indirectly result in the relocation or
   even eviction of households or communities, thereby increasing
   vulnerabilities for some while intending to reduce long-term climate
   vulnerabilities for all. We argue that this raises serious, if
   underappreciated, ethical issues that need to be more explicitly
   addressed in adaptation policy making. We illustrate our conceptual
   argument with the help of three examples of infrastructural `climate
   buffers': Space for the River projects in the Netherlands, the
   Diamer-Bhasha dam in Pakistan and the coastal protection plan in
   Jakarta, Indonesia.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change of cities is currently becoming one of the
   key points in the planning processes. Adaptation contributes to
   preservation/improvement of the quality of life and human well-being. It
   should be an integral part of SMART Cities. Implementation of adaptation
   measures frequently faces numerous problems, including insufficient
   awareness of manifestations of climate change or importance of different
   measures. On an example of the urban district Brno-Novy Liskovec, the
   paper demonstrates possible approaches that play a supporting role in
   planning and implementation of adaptation measures. To promote further
   development of nature based solutions, the paper presents an economic
   assessment of existing measures, including an assessment of their
   benefits. The results indicate that the implementation of a park with a
   wetland in the densely built-up area has brought high social benefits

Abstract = {Evidence-based information on household-level adaptation is an important
   element of integrated management of vulnerable coastal regions. A
   growing number of empirical studies deal with household-level adaptation
   at the coast in different regions. This article provides a systematic
   review of these studies. We analyze studies according to how households
   in different parts of the world are currently adapting, or how they are
   intending to adapt, and identify explanatory factors for adaptation
   behavior and intention. We find that households implement a broad range
   of adaptation measures and that adaptation behavior is explained by
   individual factors such as socioeconomic and cognitive variables,
   experience, and perceived responsibilities. Nonpersonal characteristics
   have also been used to explain adaptation behavior and intention but
   have not been extensively investigated. Few studies employ qualitative
   research methods and use inductive approaches as well as models stemming
   from behavioral economics. Our findings suggest that coastal risk
   management policies should communicate the efficacy of household-level
   adaptation, in addition to information about flood risk, in order to
   encourage coastal households in their adaptation activities. In this
   context, we discuss the role of resources and responsibility of
   households for their adaptation behavior. We describe the lessons learnt
   and formulate a research agenda on household-level adaptation to coastal
   flood risk. In practice, coastal risk management policies should further
   promote individually driven adaptation by integrating it in adaptation
   strategies and processes.},

Title = {Barriers to Municipal Climate Adaptation: Examples From Coastal
   Massachusetts' Smaller Cities and Towns},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {80},
Number = {2},
Pages = {110-122},

Abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Many global cities are making
   good progress on climate adaptation. There is less information, however,
   on climate adaptation among smaller cities and towns: Are their
   approaches similar when undertaking adaptation? Do the barriers they
   face mirror those of large cities? In this study, we undertake
   fine-grained empirical research on the perceptions of 18 municipal
   planners in 14 coastal cities and towns in Massachusetts; our findings
   are thus limited to planners' perceptions of efforts and barriers in one
   region of the United States. These communities are very early in the
   uptake of climate adaptation policies and use a range of approaches when
   they do begin adaptation, including planning, mainstreaming, or
   addressing current hazards. The planners interviewed reported that
   barriers to adaptation actions tend to be interconnected; for example,
   the strength of private property interests often limits local political
   leadership on the issue. Without such leadership, it is difficult for
   planners to allocate time and/or money to adaptation activities. It is
   also challenging to gain support from local residents for climate
   adaptation action, while a lack of accepted technical data complicates
   efforts.
   Takeaway for practice: In coastal Massachusetts, and perhaps elsewhere,
   local residents, planners, and their municipal bodies, as well as the
   states, must act in multiple ways to encourage the development of
   meaningful climate adaptation action in smaller cities and towns.},

Abstract = {The vulnerability of developing countries to potential impacts of
   climate change and the options for adaptation are rapidly emerging as
   central issues in the debate around policy responses to climate change.
   In order to prioritize, design and implement interventions to adapt to
   climate change, it is essential to adopt a coherent and consistent set
   of definitions and frameworks for examining vulnerability, adaptation
   and adaptive capacity. In practice, a variety of definitions of
   vulnerability and adaptation are found in the literature. This paper
   uses the base of literature from the context of the coastal impacts of
   climate change to draw some explicit linkages between the objectives of
   vulnerability and adaptation assessment and the definitions used in the
   analysis. We find that such a linkage is helpful for identifying the
   nature of assessment required, and the data and information necessary.
   The paper concludes with some thoughts regarding directions for research
   with regard to vulnerability and adaptation assessment.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation in the Pacific Island tourism sector:
   analysing the policy environment in Vanuatu},
Journal = {CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-274},
Abstract = {Tourism is a growing economic sector in the South Pacific providing the
   region with great potential for economic development. Vanuatu and its
   neighbouring Small Island Developing States and Territories experience a
   high vulnerability to climate change impacts. The tourism sector in
   Vanuatu is particularly vulnerable, and it needs to develop and
   implement effective adaptation strategies to reduce climate change
   risks. Policies play an important role by providing the platform on
   which adaptation can occur and resilience be built. This study examines
   the policy environment in Vanuatu for its conduciveness to climate
   change adaptation. It identifies the types of adaptation processes
   (explicit or implicit) and types of adaptation measures (technical,
   business management, behavioural, policy, and research and education)
   and critically analyses the current tourism-related policies for their
   effectiveness in assisting the sector to address climate change. It is
   found that the majority of policies identified deal with climate change
   through implicit adaptation processes and mainly through the use of
   policy and research and education measures. The authors argue that in
   order to strengthen the resilience of the tourism industry, the
   Government of Vanuatu needs to develop and implement explicit climate
   change adaptation policies for the tourism sector.},

Title = {Balancing GHG mitigation and land-use conflicts: Alternative Northern
   European energy system scenarios},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {310},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Long-term power market outlooks suggest a rapid increase in renewable
   energy deployment as a main solution to greenhouse gas mitigation in the
   Northern European energy system. However, the consequential area
   requirement is a non-techno-economic aspect that currently is omitted by
   many energy system optimization models. This study applies modeling to
   generate alternatives (MGA) technique to the Balmorel energy system
   model to address spatial conflicts related to increased renewable energy
   deployment. The approach searches for alternative solutions that
   minimize land-use conflicts while meeting the low-carbon target, by
   allowing a 1\% to 15\% increase in system costs compared to the
   least-cost solution. Two alternative objectives are defined to reflect
   various aspects of spatial impact. The results show that the least-cost
   solution requires 1.2\%-3.6\% of the land in the modeled countries in
   2040 for onshore wind and solar PV installations. A 10\% increase in
   costs can reduce the required land area by 58\% by relying more on
   offshore wind. Nuclear energy may also be an option if both onshore and
   offshore areas are to be reduced, or in a less flexible system. Both
   offshore wind and nuclear energy technologies are associated with higher
   risks and pose uncertainties in terms of reaching the climate targets in
   time. The changes in costs and required land areas imply significantly
   higher annual costs ranging from 200 to 750 kEUR/km2 to avoid land use
   for energy infrastructure. Overall, this study confirms that the energy
   transition strategies prioritizing land savings from energy
   infrastructure are feasible, but high risks and costs of averted land
   are involved.},

Abstract = {Climate change is intensifying urban climate problems and the design of
   public and private spaces should take this into account. However, the
   public often does not recognize these problems due to perceptual
   barriers. The hypothesis of this paper is that such perceptual barriers
   can be overcome through `climate revelatory visualizations' that
   communicate the problems and solutions in an understandable way and can
   nudge parties into taking action. We created and tested several
   photorealistic animated visualization styles. The results indicate that
   urban climate problems and adaptation measures should be presented in
   photorealistic animations with graphic overlays to overcome perceptual
   barriers. The climate revelatory visualizations should frame climate
   adaptation positively, and feature the everyday environments of the
   target audience. Visualizations that reveal current situations,
   specifically the risks of particular climate problems, prove to have a
   warning function, whereas visualizations that reveal adaptation measures
   can motivate citizens and urban designers to take adaptation action.},

Title = {Effect of the macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis on methane production
   and rumen microbiome assemblage},
Journal = {ANIMAL MICROBIOME},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: Recent studies using batch-fermentation suggest that the red
   macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis has the potential to reduce methane
   (CH4) production from beef cattle by up to similar to 99\% when added to
   Rhodes grass hay; a common feed in the Australian beef industry. These
   experiments have shown significant reductions in CH4 without
   compromising other fermentation parameters (i.e. volatile fatty acid
   production) with A. taxiformis organic matter (OM) inclusion rates of up
   to 5\%. In the study presented here, A. taxiformis was evaluated for its
   ability to reduce methane production from dairy cattle fed a mixed
   ration widely utilized in California, the largest milk producing state
   in the US.
   Results: Fermentation in a semi-continuous in-vitro rumen system
   suggests that A. taxiformis can reduce methane production from enteric
   fermentation in dairy cattle by 95\% when added at a 5\% OM inclusion
   rate without any obvious negative impacts on volatile fatty acid
   production. High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon
   sequencing showed that seaweed amendment effects rumen microbiome
   consistent with the Anna Karenina hypothesis, with increased
   beta-diversity, over time scales of approximately 3 days. The relative
   abundance of methanogens in the fermentation vessels amended with A.
   taxiformis decreased significantly compared to control vessels, but this
   reduction in methanogen abundance was only significant when averaged
   over the course of the experiment. Alternatively, significant reductions
   of CH4 in the A. taxiformis amended vessels was measured in the early
   stages of the experiment. This suggests that A. taxiformis has an
   immediate effect on the metabolic functionality of rumen methanogens
   whereas its impact on microbiome assemblage, specifically methanogen
   abundance, is delayed.
   Conclusions: The methane reducing effect of A. taxiformis during rumen
   fermentation makes this macroalgae a promising candidate as a biotic
   methane mitigation strategy for dairy cattle. But its effect in-vivo
   (i.e. in dairy cattle) remains to be investigated in animal trials.
   Furthermore, to obtain a holistic understanding of the biochemistry
   responsible for the significant reduction of methane, gene expression
   profiles of the rumen microbiome and the host animal are warranted.},

Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY IN SOUTH ASIA},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {587-596},
Abstract = {Ever increasing demand for food and the basic necessities, driven by
   high demographic pressure and rapid economic development, necessitate
   strengthening the scientific knowledge of underpinning processes and
   creating the data bank for development of decision support system which
   policy makers can use to address urgent issues. The goal is to identify
   and implement strategies of natural resources management which adapt to
   the climate change with specific references to alterations in
   precipitation, temperature, risks of soil degradation, quality and
   quantity of water resources, and increase incidence of pests and
   pathogens. The adaptive management is crucial to addressing the complex
   issues of climate change, environmental degradation, and food security.
   Other researchable topics include: (i) the fate of carbon transported by
   erosional processes, (ii) coupled ocean and climate studies, (iii)
   glacier dynamics in the Himalayas, (iv) monsoon science, and (v) drought
   management. There is a need for immediate action through a coordinated
   program implemented on a regional basis. Funding for long-term
   multi-disciplinary research must conic from regional sources. Global
   environmental solutions require global funding for conducting
   solution-oriented research.},

Title = {Putting adaptive planning into practice: A meta-analysis of current
   applications},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {106},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Adaptive planning, as opposed to the conventional `predict-and-act'
   approach, has emerged as a paradigm to increase the resilience of our
   built environment and infrastructure systems. However, we have a limited
   understanding of the broader governance environment that can enable or
   hinder adaptive planning. Research is dominated by individual case
   studies, which limits the generalisability of findings. We conducted a
   meta-analysis of 40 cases of real-world application of adaptive planning
   globally. We assessed the extent to which those processes have adhered
   to key elements of an `ideal' adaptive approach, and identified the
   enablers and barriers to implementation. Our results show that adaptive
   planning applications are far from ideal. The enablers and barriers
   identified across all cases, and tested for statistical significance,
   indicate that enacting adaptive planning requires dedicated governance
   structures that take on the coordination and brokering role, long-term
   investment strategies that go beyond short-term budgetary cycles, and
   transdisciplinary environments that challenge simplistic assumptions
   entrenched in disciplinary experiences. Adaptive planning also requires
   a redefinition of performance and success indicators, from delivering a
   quick fix, onto longer term benefits that can be achieved through
   experimentation. We conclude by presenting the makings of a
   meta-governance framework that can guide adaptive planning in practice.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is a major factor across Asia and the Pacific, and so the
   scope of this chapter is somewhat restricted. There is a focus on larger
   urban areas, as the small communities of rural areas are discussed in
   other chapters. The breadth of the topic of urbanization also means that
   reports by government agencies and NGOs (grey literature) are cited, as
   well as the formal academic literature. The six sections of the present
   Chapter systematically review literature in the field. In the first
   section we overview urbanization trends in the region. In the second
   section we review the history of urbanization in the region. The third
   section examines urbanization and climate in Asia and the Pacific. The
   fourth section describes the risks in urban areas due to climate
   change-related hazards. The fifth section overviews mitigation and
   adaptation measures in the region. The final section concludes with the
   needs for resilient cities and addresses uncertainties, research gaps
   and policy measures.
   Future predictions suggest that large cities will not hold most of the
   region's total urban population. In 1990, cities of larger than one
   million held almost 35.1 \% of the total urban population and by 2025
   the UN predicts that cities of one million or more will hold 41.2 \% of
   the total urban population. The share of those living in mega-cities is
   expected to increase from 8.9 \% of the total urban population to 12.8
   \% during the same period. While expectations are for an increase in
   share, there still remains 58.2 \% of the urban population living in
   settlements smaller than one million. This fact is all the more
   impressive given the large population that is expected to move into
   cities in the region between 2010 and 2025 (over 549 million in 15
   years, or over 36 million people a year).
   Climate resilient cities are those that can withstand climate effects
   and not change dramatically. They include biophysical and socio-economic
   sub-systems that can withstand various climate impacts and continue to
   develop in a fairly predictable manner. Cities that are not resilient
   change dramatically to new states with new relationships emerging both
   within the socio-economic sub-system and between the socio-economic and
   biophysical sub-systems. Resilient cities are sustainable cities.
   Resilience can be achieved when urban areas move along a more
   sustainable pathway. The goal of policy makers and stakeholders for
   their individual urban centres, urban regions as well as nations in the
   face of climate change is to enhance resilience. In the present review
   of cities in the Asia-Pacific region, we identify some important aspects
   that impinge on this goal. Addressing uncertainties, research gaps and
   policy needs related to climate change and urbanization will help make
   cities in the region more resilient.},

Title = {New developments and future challenges in reducing and controlling heat
   island effect in urban areas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Abstract = {The collection of research conducted over the past decade on urban heat
   islands and its mitigation strategies reflects the new approaches of
   scientists, researchers, and government agencies on urban design and
   planning about the intensity of urban heat islands and their impact on
   urban texture. This study aims to analyze the trend of research on urban
   heat islands and strategies to reduce them during the last decade
   (2010-2020). This review has prepared from 91 research studies and
   evaluated the main measures to reduce the urban heat island that is
   commonly used today. In addition, the distribution based on the
   Koppen-Geiger climate classification, the review of different
   methodologies, and the funding of research has also been evaluated.
   Analysis has revealed that studies in humid subtropical (Cfa), hot
   summer Mediterranean (Csa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb) climates have
   the largest share among other climatic regions that some measures (urban
   parks, urban trees, green roofs) have played a critical role for
   researchers and policy makers more than other influential factors in
   reducing urban heat islands. It is also noticeable that the relative
   share of research provided in the four main groups of mitigation
   measures is almost the same; this similarity can be interpreted to
   support the argument that lack of funding does not have a significant
   effect on some mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {The world's oceans are highly impacted by climate change and other human
   pressures, with significant implications for marine ecosystems and the
   livelihoods that they support. Adaptation for both natural and human
   systems is increasingly important as a coping strategy due to the rate
   and scale of ongoing and potential future change. Here, we conduct a
   review of literature concerning specific case studies of adaptation in
   marine systems, and discuss associated characteristics and influencing
   factors, including drivers, strategy, timeline, costs, and limitations.
   We found ample evidence in the literature that shows that marine species
   are adapting to climate change through shifting distributions and timing
   of biological events, while evidence for adaptation through evolutionary
   processes is limited. For human systems, existing studies focus on
   frameworks and principles of adaptation planning, but examples of
   implemented adaptation actions and evaluation of outcomes are scarce.
   These findings highlight potentially useful strategies given specific
   social-ecological contexts, as well as key barriers and specific
   information gaps requiring further research and actions.},

Title = {Implications of indicator aggregation methods for global change

Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1109-1141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Composite indices are used to assess and prioritize mitigation and
   adaptation strategies for addressing the impacts of global environmental
   change. We evaluate different aggregation tools for creating these
   indices and their potential effects on mitigation and adaptation
   efforts. We assess the association of each aggregation tool with
   different types of trade-offs, risk strategies, and the resulting
   spatial and statistical distribution of their composite scores. Four
   aggregation tools are investigated (Weighted Linear Combination, WLC;
   Ordered Weighted Average, OWA; Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA;
   Compromise Programming, CP) using an example of vulnerability to
   flooding in the eastern United States. The choice of aggregation tool
   affects vulnerability outcomes, decision risk strategies, and the
   prioritization of vulnerability reduction strategies. DEA produces the
   highest vulnerability scores, representing a risk averse strategy
   associated with pessimistic outcomes. WLC implies a neutral and fixed
   risk strategy. CP produces a range of outcomes from neutral (equivalent
   to the WLC) to pessimistic, depending on its parameters. OWA offers the
   highest flexibility to adjust the levels of trade-off and risk strategy,
   producing a range of vulnerability outcomes, from optimistic to
   pessimistic. The units of analysis, when prioritized across the
   different aggregation tools, are more consistent for the top ranked
   units. However, the differences in rank become substantial as the
   selection threshold score decreases. To obtain better informed
   vulnerability reduction strategies, we recommend to (i) address how
   trade-off and decision risk are embedded in the aggregation tool chosen,
   and (ii) evaluate their effect in the prioritization of mitigation and
   adaptation strategies being considered.},

Abstract = {Human-induced changes to global climate have become increasingly
   difficult to ignore in recent years. As the frequency and severity of
   extreme weather events increases, the impacts on both natural and human
   systems are becoming difficult to manage with the current policies. In
   Canada, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change is the
   Arctic, where temperatures are rising at a rate two to three times that
   of the global average. Warmer seasonal temperatures have led to melting
   permafrost and increased variability in sea ice conditions, which has
   contributed to a rise in coastal erosion. The ongoing resilience of
   Arctic communities will depend heavily on their ability to implement
   successful long-term adaptation policies. The development and
   implementation of any action on climate change adaptation should involve
   collaboration with local stakeholders in order to reflect the views and
   experience of those living in the Arctic.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation strategies and shrimp aquaculture: Empirical
   evidence from the Mekong Delta of Vietnam},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {196},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Shrimp aquaculture is among the most vital sectors in the Mekong Delta
   of Vietnam regarding economic well- being, social aspects, and food
   security beyond the country boundary. Nevertheless, this sector has
   faced emerging challenges from increased climate variability during
   recent decades, negatively influencing its out-comes. This paper
   utilized farm-level data surveyed in 2019 to investigate the mechanisms
   behind households' decisions to adopt three primary climate change
   adaptation practices: upgrading pond dikes, lining ponds with plastic
   sheets, and having settling ponds. This study demonstrates the effects
   of adopting these strategies on shrimp farming performance. An
   endogenous switching regression model was employed to deal with
   potential selection bias and heterogeneity in the decision to adopt or
   not. We find that the adoption of upgrading pond dikes and having a
   settling pond result in higher productivity in shrimp farming, and both
   adopters and non- adopters of these strategies would benefit from the
   adaptation. As well, education of the farm operators and farmers' belief
   on changes in climatic conditions and their impacts on shrimp farming
   are the main drivers behind the adoption behavior. This study,
   therefore, provides empirical evidence for policymakers to promote
   specific climate change adaptation strategies that would improve the
   welfare of shrimp farmers.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {When President Biden took office in January 2021, he immediately
   re-invigorated the United States' commitment to addressing climate
   change, including climate adaptation, through Executive Order
   13990-Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science
   to Tackle the Climate Crisis (January 20, 2021) and Executive Order
   14008-Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (January 27, 2021).
   Federal agencies have continued to implement these and other
   climate-related executive orders. This article examines recent legal
   developments to summarize the United States' current policy approach to
   climate change adaptation, especially as such developments affect marine
   sector. Despite the natural tendency to focus on the federal
   government-and there have indeed been improvements in federal adaptation
   policy since the Biden Administration took office-this article also
   argues that focusing solely on the federal government reveals only one
   facet of important developments in the United States' climate adaptation
   policy. Instead, this article acknowledges and illuminates the
   pluralistic and federalistic structure of United States governance,
   concluding that much climate adaptation work occurs within tribes and
   through state and local governments, regardless of who sits in the Oval
   Office.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Some actions intended to adapt to climate change may do more harm than
   good, especially when they consume energy, making it more difficult to
   shift to decarbonized energy, or when, in meeting the needs of one group
   of people, they increase the vulnerability of others. Heat wave risk
   provides a typical example: air conditioning (AC) equipment may trigger
   large energy consumption and worsen outdoor heat stress. Alternative
   adaptation strategies exist, but it is not clear whether they can
   prevent the massive use of AC. Here, with an interdisciplinary modeling
   platform, taking Paris as a case study, we provide a first quantified
   analysis of the efficiency of adaptation strategies (large scale urban
   greening, building insulation policy, and generalized behavioral changes
   in AC use) in reducing future potential AC need. We find that even
   ambitious strategies do not appear sufficient to totally replace AC and
   ensure thermal comfort, under a median climate change scenario. They
   can, however, reduce AC energy use by half during heat waves and
   compensate for the heat released to the outdoor environment. Our results
   show that adaptation actions, implemented early, may play a key role if
   we are to remain on a low-carbon pathway.},

Abstract = {Future changes in climate pose significant challenges for society, not
   the least of which is how best to adapt to observed and potential future
   impacts of these changes to which the world is already committed.
   Adaptation is a dynamic social process: the ability of societies to
   adapt is determined, in part, by the ability to act collectively. This
   article reviews emerging perspectives on collective action and social
   capital and argues that insights from these areas inform the nature of
   adaptive capacity and normative prescriptions of policies of adaptation.
   Specifically, social capital is increasingly understood within economics
   to have public and private elements, both of which are based on trust,
   reputation, and reciprocal action. The public-good aspects of particular
   forms of social capital are pertinent elements of adaptive capacity in
   interacting with natural capital and in relation to the performance of
   institutions that cope with the risks of changes in climate. Case
   studies are presented of present-day collective action for coping with
   extremes in weather in coastal areas in Southeast Asia and of
   community-based coastal management in the Caribbean. These cases
   demonstrate the importance of social capital framing both the public and
   private institutions of resource management that build resilience in the
   face of the risks of changes in climate. These cases illustrate, by
   analogy, the nature of adaptation processes and collective action in
   adapting to future changes in climate.},

Title = {Integrating Collaboration, Adaptive Management, and Scenario-Planning:
   Experiences at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {There is growing recognition that public lands cannot be managed as
   islands; rather, land management must address the ecological, social,
   and temporal complexity that often spans jurisdictions and traditional
   planning horizons. Collaborative decision making and adaptive management
   (CAM) have been promoted as methods to reconcile competing societal
   demands and respond to complex ecosystem dynamics. We detail the
   experiences of land managers and stakeholders in using CAM at Las
   Cienegas National Conservation Area (LCNCA), a highly valued site under
   the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The CAM process
   at Las Cienegas is marked by strong stakeholder engagement, with four
   core elements: (1) shared watershed goals with measurable resource
   objectives; (2) relevant and reliable scientific information; (3)
   mechanisms to incorporate new information into decision making; and (4)
   shared learning to improve both the process and management actions. The
   combination of stakeholder engagement and adaptive management has led to
   agreement on contentious issues, more innovative solutions, and more
   effective land management. However, the region is now experiencing rapid
   changes outside managers' control, including climate change, human
   population growth, and reduced federal budgets, with large but
   unpredictable impacts on natural resources. Although the CAM experience
   provides a strong foundation for making the difficult and contentious
   management decisions that such changes are likely to require, neither
   collaboration nor adaptive management provides a sufficient structure
   for addressing the externalities that drive uncontrollable and
   unpredictable change. As a result, LCNCA is exploring two specific
   modifications to CAM that may better address emerging challenges,
   including: (1) creating nested resource objectives to distinguish
   between those objectives that may be crucial to maintaining ecological
   resilience from those that may hinder a flexible response to climate
   change, and (2) incorporating scenario planning into CAM to explore how
   climate change may interact with other drivers and alter options for the
   future, to identify robust management actions, and to prioritize
   ecological monitoring efforts. The experiences at LCNCA demonstrate how
   collaboration and adaptive management can be used to improve social and
   environmental outcomes and, with modifications, may help address the
   full range of complexity and change that threatens to overwhelm even the
   best efforts to sustain public lands.},

Abstract = {Mitigation of archaeological sites can be a costly endeavor in a
   pipeline company's effort to comply with environmental regulations.
   Avoiding a site is often impractical and excavating it may appear to be
   the only solution. Unfortunately, these traditional mitigation measures
   are too often the only solutions considered when dealing with
   archaeological sites. This paper discusses traditional mitigation
   measures and presents an alternative strategy to archaeological site
   treatment. Off-site, or off right-of-way, mitigation is a creative
   mitigation alternative that can be applied to some sites if conditions
   and circumstances permit. Within the body of this paper, an example of
   an alternative mitigation measure utilized by Williams Gas
   Pipeline-Transco on the construction of a recent gas pipeline across
   Pine Breeze Island in Pennsylvania is discussed.},

Title = {A Review of Cost Estimates for Flood Adaptation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Floods are the most devastating of global natural disasters, and flood
   adaptation measures are needed to reduce future risk. Researchers have
   started to evaluate the costs and benefits of flood adaptation, but
   information regarding the cost of different flood adaptation measures is
   often not available or is hidden in non-peer-reviewed literature. Recent
   review studies have explored cost estimates for different aspects of
   flood adaptation, such as nature-based solutions. This study aims to
   contribute empirical data regarding the cost of flood adaptation by
   compiling peer-reviewed literature and research reports. The focus is on
   construction costs and expenses for operation and maintenance. This
   paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation
   measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood
   protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions
   for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based
   solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates
   are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016).
   Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and
   developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used
   as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to have impacts on the power sector, leading
   to, among others, a need for adaptation measures in the sector in the
   near future. This paper analyses the need to adapt to climate change
   impacts for power generation technologies in Europe until 2100. Europe
   is broadly divided into four geographic climate zones, for which
   regional climate change impacts are quantified with the help of the
   ENSEMBLES RT2b data. The European future technology mix is based on two
   Eurelectric energy scenarios: `Baseline 2009' and `Power Choices'. A
   Risk Assessment Model is formulated which assesses the cost to power
   plants for adapting to climate change. The analysis shows that thermal
   generation units most urgently need adaptation measures against floods,
   whereas off-shore wind power plants would need to take adaptation
   investments against sea level rise. Furthermore, electricity grids need
   to adapt to the increased incidence of storms. Finally, hydro generation
   in the Mediterranean regions needs to adapt to lower levels of
   precipitation. (C) 2015 International Energy Initiative. Published by

Abstract = {This article analyses the concept of blue carbon ecosystems,

   change law and environmental law. Aspects of the two international law
   regimes relevant to blue carbon ecosystems are identified and discussed,
   and it is argued that blue carbon ecosystems can be included in climate
   change mitigation strategies. Despite the potential difficulties
   associated with doing this via climate change law and environmental law,
   utilising a combination of the two regimes may be a sensible approach.
   Using Indonesia as a case study, the article concludes by outlining the
   applicability and ongoing implementation of the concept in that country,
   which has more mangrove coverage than any other country in the world.
   Indonesia's ongoing endeavour to include blue carbon ecosystems in its

Title = {Comparative Analysis and Mitigation Strategy for the Urban Heat Island
   Intensity in Bari (Italy) and in Other Six European Cities},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The presence of higher air temperatures in the city in comparison with
   the surrounding rural areas is an alarming phenomenon named the urban
   heat island (UHI). In the last decade, the scientific community
   demonstrated the severity of the phenomenon amplified by the combination
   of heat waves. In southern Italy, the UHI is becoming increasingly
   serious due to the presence of a warming climate, extensive urbanization
   and an aging population. In order to extensively investigate such
   phenomenon in several cities, recent research calibrated quantitative
   indexes to forecast the maximum UHI intensity in urban districts by
   exploiting multicriteria approaches and open-source data. This paper
   proposes different mitigation strategy to mitigate the Urban Heat Island
   Intensity in Bari. Firstly, the research evaluates the absolute max UHI
   intensity of the 17 urban districts of Bari (a city in southern Italy,
   Puglia) by exploiting the recent index-based approach I-UHII. Secondly,
   a comparative evaluation of seven European cities (Bari, Alicante,
   Madrid, Paris, Berlin, Milan and London) is achieved to point out the
   positives and negative aspects of the different urban districts. In
   total, the comparison required the analysis of 344 districts of 7
   European cities: 17 districts in Bari (Italia); 9 districts in Alicante
   (Spain); 21 in Madrid (Spain); 80 in Paris (France); 96 in Berlin
   (Germany); 88 in Milan (Italy) and 33 in London (UK). Finally, the
   results emphasize some virtuous examples of UHII mitigation in the major
   European cities useful to draw inspiration for effective mitigation
   strategies suitable for the urban context of Bari.},

Title = {Assessment of spatiotemporal variations in the fluvial wash-load
   component in the 21st century with regard to GCM climate change
   scenarios},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {533},

Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {For stream water, in which a relationship exists between wash-load
   concentration and discharge, an estimate of fine-sediment delivery may
   be obtained from a traditional fluvial wash-load rating curve. Here, we
   demonstrate that the remaining wash-load material load can be estimated
   from a traditional empirical principle on a nationwide scale. The
   traditional technique was applied to stream water for the whole of
   Japan. Four typical GCMs were selected from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble to provide the driving
   fields for the following regional climate models to assess the wash-load
   component based on rating curves: the Model for Interdisciplinary
   Research on Climate (MIROC), the Meteorological Research Institute
   Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), the Hadley Centre
   Global Environment Model (HadGEM) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
   Laboratory (GFDL) climate model. The simulations consisted of an
   ensemble, including multiple physics configurations and different
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), which
   was used to produce monthly datasets for the whole country of Japan. The
   impacts of future climate changes on fluvial wash load in Japanese
   stream water were based on the balance of changes in hydrological
   factors. The annual and seasonal variations of the fluvial wash load
   were assessed from the result of the ensemble analysis in consideration
   of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission scenarios. The determined results
   for the amount of wash load increase range from approximately 20 to
   110\% in the 2040s, especially along part of the Pacific Ocean and the
   Sea of Japan regions. In the 2090s, the amount of wash load is projected
   to increase by more than 50\% over the whole of Japan. The assessment
   indicates that seasonal variation is particularly important because the
   rainy and typhoon seasons, which include extreme events, are the
   dominant seasons. Because fluvial wash-load-component turbidity appears
   to vary exponentially, this phenomenon has an impact on the management
   of social capital, such as drinking water services. Prediction of the
   impacts of future climate change on fluvial wash-load sediment is
   crucial for effective environmental planning and the management of
   social capital to adapt to the next century.
   Capsule: We demonstrate that simulations comprise an ensemble of
   factors, including multiple physical configurations, associated with the
   wash-load component for the whole of Japan. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   requires different approaches and strategies which have survived

   various anthropogenic, morphologic factors and global changes have
   contributed to coastal erosion. Both cities' tourism numbers exceed

Abstract = {Proactive and coordinated action to mitigate and adapt to climate change
   will be essential for achieving the healthy, resilient, safe,
   sustainably harvested and biodiverse ocean that the UN Decade of Ocean
   Science and sustainable development goals (SDGs) seek. Ocean-based
   mitigation actions could contribute 12\% of the emissions reductions
   required by 2030 to keep warming to less than 1.5 oC but, because
   substantial warming is already locked in, extensive adaptation action is
   also needed. Here, as part of the Future Seas project, we use a
   ``foresighting/hindcasting{''} technique to describe two scenarios for
   2030 in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation for
   ocean systems. The ``business-as-usual{''} future is expected if current
   trends continue, while an alternative future could be realised if
   society were to effectively use available data and knowledge to push as
   far as possible towards achieving the UN SDGs. We identify three drivers
   that differentiate between these alternative futures: (i) appetite for
   climate action, (ii) handling extreme events, and (iii) climate
   interventions. Actions that could navigate towards the optimistic,
   sustainable and technically achievable future include: proactive

Abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
   (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs
   are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change
   research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of
   future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The
   pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort
   and describe plausible major global developments that together would
   lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation
   to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing
   alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable
   development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development,
   and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and
   economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range
   consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used
   for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions
   trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to
   global energy consumption of 400-1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly
   different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in
   cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million
   hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline
   scenarios range from about 25 GtCO(2) to more than 120 GtCO(2) per year
   by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs
   strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the
   socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The
   carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m(2) that is consistent
   with a temperature change limit of 2 degrees C, differs in our analysis
   thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios.
   Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with
   high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent
   different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives
   and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly
   representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent
   use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical
   next steps for the community scenario process will, among others,
   involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the
   adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios
   with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th
   climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6). (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {The European AQUO project started in October 2012, in the scope of the
   FP7 European Research Framework, for three years duration. The final
   goal is to provide policy makers with practical guidelines and
   solutions, in order to mitigate underwater noise footprint due to noise
   radiation from ships. For a maritime area under consideration,
   mitigation solutions can be split into two categories: the first one is
   to reduce the underwater noise emission of the noisiest vessels sailing
   in the area, and the second one is related to ship traffic management.
   The present paper addresses the first type, and the purpose is to assess
   the efficiency of different mitigation measures, corresponding to the
   dedicated task 5.2 of AQUO Project. First, an overview of a
   comprehensive list of possible mitigation measures is presented. Then,
   study cases corresponding to reference vessels are defined and several
   mitigation measures are tested in order to give an estimation of the
   reduction of ship source level (underwater radiated noise). To achieve
   this task, different modeling techniques and experimental results from
   previous tasks of AQUO Project are used. Special care must be taken on
   the relative importance of the part of radiated noise due to internal
   machinery and engines, and the part due to propeller(s). The analysis of
   the result allow identifying the most promising solutions.},

Abstract = {In the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage area, many factors have been
   observed that imply effects of climate change on ecosystems, such as
   decreases in seasonal sea ice, changes in fishing grounds, and the
   appearance of non-local species. This study summarizes observed and
   anticipated effects of such climate change on fisheries in the heritage
   area and discusses policy and research needs for adapting to these
   changes. International research and monitoring at the scale of large
   marine ecosystems (LMEs) is the basis of all policy measures for
   adapting to climate change. Several measures need to be combined, taking
   into account the various socio-ecological aspects of fisheries and
   scales of ecosystems. Such measures of adaptation should be incorporated
   also into the cross-sector coordination system and the Integrated
   Management Plan, which were established to manage the World Heritage
   area. Also, culture is an important part of society, and the World
   Heritage programme may offer clues for creating a new and peaceful
   culture based on the LME.},

Abstract = {Carrying out wildlife conservation in a changing climate requires
   planning on long timescales at both a site and network level, while also
   having the flexibility to adapt actions at sites over short timescales
   in response to changing conditions and new information. The Royal
   Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a land-owning wildlife
   conservation charity in the UK, achieves this on its nature reserves
   through its system of management planning. This involves setting
   network-wide objectives which inform the 25-year vision and 5-year
   conservation objectives for each site. Progress toward achieving each
   site's conservation objectives is reviewed annually, to identify any
   adjustments which might be needed to the site's management. The
   conservation objectives and 25-year vision of each site are reviewed
   every 5 years. Significant long-term impacts of climate change most
   frequently identified at RSPB reserves are: loss of intertidal habitat
   through coastal squeeze, loss of low-lying islands due to higher sea
   levels and coastal erosion, loss of coastal freshwater and brackish
   wetlands due to increased coastal flooding, and changes in the hydrology
   of wetlands. The main types of adaptation measures in place on RSPB
   reserves to address climate change-related impacts are: re-creation of
   intertidal habitat, re-creation and restoration of freshwater wetlands
   away from vulnerable coastal areas, blocking artificial drainage on
   peatlands, and addressing pressures on freshwater supply for lowland wet
   grasslands in eastern and southeastern England. Developing partnerships
   between organizations has been crucial in delivering large-scale
   adaptation projects.},

Abstract = {Scenarios are used to explore the consequences of different adaptation
   and mitigation strategies under uncertainty. In this paper, two
   scenarios are used to explore developments with (1) no mitigation
   leading to an increase of global mean temperature of 4 degrees C by 2100
   and (2) an ambitious mitigation strategy leading to 2 degrees C increase
   by 2100. For the second scenario, uncertainties in the climate system
   imply that a global mean temperature increase of 3 degrees C or more
   cannot be ruled out. Our analysis shows that, in many cases, adaptation
   and mitigation are not trade-offs but supplements. For example, the
   number of people exposed to increased water resource stress due to
   climate change can be substantially reduced in the mitigation scenario,
   but adaptation will still be required for the remaining large numbers of
   people exposed to increased stress. Another example is sea level rise,
   for which, from a global and purely monetary perspective, adaptation (up
   to 2100) seems more effective than mitigation. From the perspective of
   poorer and small island countries, however, stringent mitigation is
   necessary to keep risks at manageable levels. For agriculture, only a
   scenario based on a combination of adaptation and mitigation is able to
   avoid serious climate change impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Coastal adaptation to Sea Level Rise: An overview of Egypt's efforts},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {218},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Coastal zones are recognized as priority areas for climate change
   adaptation. Without robust and effective adaptation, numerous coastal
   zones will be drastically affected. There is an ongoing need for coastal
   adaptation particularly, for the low-lying deltas, which are highly
   vulnerable to the coastal hazards-based Sea Level Rise (SLR). Worldwide,
   the national coastal strategies mainly focusing on the three coastal
   adaptation approaches issued by the International Panel of Climate
   Change (retreat, accommodation, and protection). The developed and
   developing countries are being made serious efforts to adapt to the SLR.
   This paper investigates the Egyptian efforts, best practices, and
   experiences in dealing with coastal erosion, flooding, and
   inundation-based SLR. The Egyptian national strategy for coastal
   adaptation mainly adopted the protection approach. Along the Nile Delta
   coast of Egypt, various national projects contain coastal adaptation
   measures were detected, such as seawalls, revetments, sand dunes,
   nourishment, and artificial sand dunes based on a geotextile sand-tube
   core using natural reed mats for sand trapping. In addition, different
   actions such as constructing modern fish farming, regular dredging for
   coastal lakes and lagoons, and enforcing the coastal road were observed.
   All provide defense systems. Most of these promising adaptation
   technologies, efforts, and actions show favorable responses to guarantee
   adequate protection against SLR hazards.},

Title = {Realistic fisheries management reforms could mitigate the impacts of
   climate change in most countries},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Although climate change is altering the productivity and distribution of
   marine fisheries, climate-adaptive fisheries management could mitigate
   many of the negative impacts on human society. We forecast global
   fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate
   scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to
   (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2)
   quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive
   fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting
   productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and
   profits in the future relative to today for 60-65\% of countries under
   the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35\% of countries
   under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms
   would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-asusual
   management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate
   scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40\% of countries
   under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries
   management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary
   cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would
   result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic
   management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is
   bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although
   realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23-50\% of
   countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining
   countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and
   other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries.
   Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than
   business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on
   implementing-and achieving the benefits of-climate-adaptive fisheries
   reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement
   capacities.},

Abstract = {Far from being passive and/or static victims of climate change,
   indigenous peoples are hybridizing knowledge systems, and challenging
   and negotiating new environmental and social realities to develop their
   own adaptation options within their own registers of what is place and
   culture appropriate. Our paper seeks to demonstrate how we, as guests on
   Maori land, were able to develop a partnership with a Maori community
   facing difficult adaptation decisions regarding climate change hazards
   through the pragmatic navigation of multi-disciplinary research and
   practice. In particular, we co-developed and tested the potential of a
   serious game (Marae-opoly) approach as a platform which assembles
   cross-cultural climate change knowledge to learn, safely experiment and
   inform adaptation decisions. Marae-opoly was developed bespoke to its
   intended context-to support the creation of mutually agreeable dynamic
   adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) for localized flood adaptation. Game
   material was generated by drawing together detailed local knowledge
   (i.e. hydrology, climate data, matauranga hapu) and situated adaptation
   options and accurate contextual data to create a credible gaming
   experience for the hapu of Tangoio Marae. We argue that the in-situ
   co-development process used to co-create Marae-opoly was fundamental in
   its success in achieving outcomes for the hapu. It also provided
   important lessons for the research team regarding how to enter as
   respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a resource to
   support our partners' adaptation decisions. The paper discusses the
   steps taken to establish research partnerships and develop the serious
   game and its subsequent playing, albeit we do not evaluate our
   indigenous research partners' adaptation decisions. Our contribution
   with this paper is in sharing an approach which cultivated the ground to
   enter as respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a
   resource for our partners' adaptation decisions.},

Abstract = {Advances in the scientific literature have focused attention on the need
   to develop adaptation strategies to reduce the risks, and take advantage
   of the opportunities, posed by climate change and climate variability.
   Adaptation needs to be considered as part of any response plan. But
   appropriate adaptive responses will vary across different geographic
   regions since the potential consequences of climate change and
   variability for human and natural systems will vary regionally in scope
   and severity. The assessment of consequences and selection of
   appropriate adaptation strategies is a complex challenge for regional
   and local decision makers. To aid in these assessments, the U.S. EPA
   developed a decision support software system called the Tool for
   Environmental Assessment and Management (TEAM) that employs a
   multicriteria approach for evaluating actions to address climate change
   impacts. Applications of TEAM have revealed some strengths of this tool:
   (1) transparency of the methodology used in TEAM is important,
   particularly to international audiences; (2) the structure encourages
   users to consider strategies and attributes from an array of
   disciplines, which leads to more effective outcomes; (3) the ability to
   consider and understand tradeoffs of noncomparable attributes is
   essential to good decision making; and (4) TEAM fosters communication
   and consensus among participants in the decision making process, in
   particular through the use of visual display features and sensitivity
   analyses.},

Title = {Total ecosystem blue carbon stocks and sequestration potential along a
   naturally regenerated mangrove forest chronosequence},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {527},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Naturally regenerated (NR) mangroves offer an excellent passive approach
   for climate change mitigation and adaptation under UN decade of
   restoration program. However, the support of NR mangroves on total
   ecosystem carbon (TEC) stocks and sequestration potential remained
   unclear across forest stand development process that can significantly
   vary spatially and temporally due to regeneration age. Using the `space
   for time' approach, this study quantified the TEC stocks along the
   Merlimau - Kuala Sebatu fringing mangrove habitat expansion
   chronosequence that comprised of 3, 6, 12, 18, 25 years age and intact
   stands. We also estimated the carbon (C) sequestration potential of each
   stand-age by comparing with un-vegetated mudflats as control. We
   collected aboveground tree, belowground root, downed woody debris,
   litterfall and soil core up to 2 m for TEC quantification and C
   sequestration. Mean TEC stocks ranged from 232 +/- 69 to 296 +/- 49 Mg
   C/ha for NR3 and NR25 respectively at the study area. TEC stocks from
   different aged NR and intact mangroves were not significantly different
   from each other and therefore did not affect by age. Aboveground trees C
   and downed wood C pools were significantly affected by stand-age. In
   contrast, sediment C stocks (representing up to 80 \%) remained generic
   over many years, driving the constant of TEC stocks in this study.
   Equally affected by age, the NR mangroves sequestered total C of 2.28 to
   17.38 (mean +/- SE: 7.36 +/- 1.88 Mg C/ha yr(-1)), with younger stands
   (NR3) holding almost six times higher total C sequestration rates than
   older mangroves (NR25). Our study suggests that highly suspended
   sediments driving from upstream, especially in the younger mangrove
   stands at a lower elevation, supports higher bulk density and C
   accumulation rate in the sediment as they expand seaward. This study
   proves that NR mangroves comprised primarily of younger mangrove stands
   can be a C sequestrator powerhouse that promises nature-based climate
   solutions through avoidance and management. Though, future research is
   needed to understand how better management and conservation practices
   can affect or towards increasing trend of TEC especially sediment carbon
   stock that holds almost 80 \% of total TEC.},

Abstract = {The interactive and cumulative impacts of climate change on natural
   resources such as coral reefs present numerous challenges for
   conservation planning and management. Climate change adaptation is
   complex due to climate-stressor interactions across multiple spatial and
   temporal scales. This leaves decision makers worldwide faced with local,
   regional, and global-scale threats to ecosystem processes and services,
   occurring over time frames that require both near-term and long-term
   planning. Thus there is a need for structured approaches to adaptation
   planning that integrate existing methods for vulnerability assessment
   with design and evaluation of effective adaptation responses. The Corals
   and Climate Adaptation Planning project of the U.S. Coral Reef Task
   Force seeks to develop guidance for improving coral reef management
   through tailored application of a climate-smart approach. This approach
   is based on principles from a recently-published guide which provides a
   framework for adopting forward-looking goals, based on assessing
   vulnerabilities to climate change and applying a structured process to
   design effective adaptation strategies. Work presented in this paper
   includes: (1) examination of the climate-smart management cycle as it
   relates to coral reefs; (2) a compilation of adaptation strategies for
   coral reefs drawn from a comprehensive review of the literature; (3)
   in-depth demonstration of climate-smart design for place-based crafting
   of robust adaptation actions; and (4) feedback from stakeholders on the
   perceived usefulness of the approach. We conclude with a discussion of
   lessons-learned on integrating climate-smart design into real-world
   management planning processes and a call from stakeholders for an
   ``adaptation design tool{''} that is now under development.},

Title = {An assessment of the physical impacts of sea-level rise and coastal
   adaptation: a case study of the eastern coast of Ghana},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise is a major coastal issue in the 21st century because many
   of the world's built assets are located in the coastal zone. Coastal
   erosion and flooding are serious threats along the coast of Ghana,
   particularly, the eastern coast where the Volta delta is located. Past
   human interventions, climate change and the resultant rise in
   sea-levels, increased storm intensity and torrential rainfall have been
   blamed for these problems. Accelerated sea-level rise and storm surge
   pose serious threat to coastal habitat, bio-diversity and socio-economic
   activities in the coastal zone of Ghana and elsewhere. There is the need
   for an holistic assessment of the impacts of sea-level rise on the coast
   zone in order to formulate appropriate adaptation policies and
   strategies to mitigate the possible effects. Using the eastern coast of
   Ghana as a case study, this paper assesses the physical impacts of
   accelerated sea level rise and storm surge on the coastal environment.
   It evaluates adaptation policies and plans that could be implemented to
   accommodate the present and any future impacts. Field investigation and
   Geographic Information System (GIS) are among the methods used for the
   assessment. The outcome of the assessment has provided comprehensive
   knowledge of the potential impacts of accelerated sea-level rise and
   storm surge on the eastern coast. It has facilitated identification of
   management units, the appraisal of alternate adaptation policies and the
   selection of the best policy options based upon the local conditions and
   environmental sustainability. Among other things, this paper reveals
   that the eastern coast of Ghana is highly vulnerable to accelerated
   sea-level rise and therefore, requires sustainable adaptation policies
   and plans to manage the potential impacts. It recommends that various
   accommodation policies, which enable areas to be occupied for longer
   before eventual retreat, could be adapted to accommodate vulnerable
   settlements in the eastern coast of Ghana.},

   Sandy},
Journal = {WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-200},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The risk of coastal flooding is increasing due to more frequent intense
   storm events, rising sea levels, and more people living in flood-prone
   areas. Although private adaptation measures can reduce damage and risk,
   most people living in risk-prone areas take only a fraction of those
   measures voluntarily. The present study examines relationships among
   individuals' beliefs and actions regarding flood-related risks based on
   in-depth interviews and structured surveys in communities deeply
   affected by Superstorm Sandy. The authors find that residents recognize
   the risk of coastal flooding and expect it to increase, although they
   appear to underestimate by how much. Although interview participants
   typically cited climate change as affecting the risks that they face,
   survey respondents' acceptance of climate change was unrelated to their
   willingness to tolerate coastal flooding risks, their beliefs about the
   effectiveness of community-level mitigation measures, or their
   willingness to take individual actions. Respondents who reported greater
   social support also reported both greater tolerance for flood risks and
   greater confidence in community adaptation measures, suggesting an
   important, but complex role of personal connections in collective
   resilience-both keeping people in place and helping them to survive
   there. Thus, residents were aware of the risks and willing to undertake
   both personal and community actions, if convinced of their
   effectiveness, regardless of their acceptance of climate change.},

Title = {Integrating Top-Down and Bottom-Up Adaptation Planning to Build Adaptive
   Capacity: A Structured Learning Approach},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {346-364},
Abstract = {Climate adaptation planning provides an opportunity to enhance the
   adaptive capacity of stakeholders across multiple levels. However,
   reviews of standard top-down and bottom-up approaches indicate that the
   value of multistakeholder involvement is not fully recognized or
   incorporated into guidelines. Focusing on provinces in Indonesia and
   Papua New Guinea within the Coral Triangle region, we present a novel
   integrated top-down and bottom-up planning approach. Based on
   Participatory Systemic Inquiry the process involves three stages of
   workshops intentionally designed to promote social learning, knowledge
   exchange, empowerment and social networks among multilevel stakeholders.
   Stage 1 workshops engage government, nongovernment and science
   stakeholders at the provincial level to analyze sub-districts'
   vulnerability and design appropriate adaptation strategies. Stage 2
   engages local government, non-government and community stakeholders
   within vulnerable sub-districts identified in Stage 1. Stage 3 combines
   Stage 1 and 2 stakeholders to refine adaptation strategies and design
   action plans for sub-districts. Evaluation demonstrated that different
   stakeholder groups' perceptions of community adaptation needs varied
   significantly, justifying the approach. In terms of adaptive capacity,
   the primary outcome for all stakeholder groups was innovative ideas,
   suggesting that social learning and knowledge exchange had occurred.
   Empowerment was a secondary outcome. We discuss how the approach could
   be further refined.},

Title = {`Walking along with development': Climate resilient pathways for
   political resource curses},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

Volume = {128},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Adaptation pathways are decision-making processes which sequence actions
   over time to account for rapid change and future uncertainty. In
   developing economies pathways practice can guide climate-resilient
   development (CRD) but is hampered by complex political dynamics,
   intensified by `resource curses' of abundant natural resources. We
   tested an adaptation pathways approach for large-scale natural resource
   development in Papua New Guinea's Bismarck Sea. We engaged with five
   contested development proposals for deep sea mining, oil palm and
   tourism to integrate CRD principles into decision-making. The process
   involved three steps: mapping decision-making and power, participatory
   pathways planning, and evaluation and learning. CRD-relevant information
   was fed into decision-making about the proposals. `Political spaces'
   were created through participatory planning that levelled power
   asymmetries, enabled common interests to emerge, democratised knowledge
   co-production, enhanced networks and coordination, and galvanised
   collective action to re-design the proposals with CRD considerations.
   The common political interests formed leverage points for conflict
   transformation and collaboration. Evaluation revealed the suspension of
   an oil palm development to allow a landuse plan to be formulated to
   account for food security, conservation and climate adaptation. The
   study highlighted three learnings: the importance of analysing politics
   and power in decision-making and identifying leverage points; the
   challenges for researchers wishing to create political spaces; and the
   necessity for capacity-building amongst local knowledge brokers to
   continue this role. We conclude by assessing the feasibility of
   mainstreaming this approach into decision-making in resource curses,
   dubbed by one decision-maker as `walking along with development'.},

Title = {Living the 14/14 Schedule: Qualitative Analysis of the Challenges and
   Coping Strategies among Families of Offshore Wind Workers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Offshore wind workers in Germany usually spend 14 days offshore,
   alternating with 14 days of spare time at home. The offshore lifestyle
   may considerably affect offshore workers' partners and families.
   However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the psychosocial
   adaptation among offshore wind couples living the 14/14 schedule. The
   present study intended to offer a contemporary view on the topic from
   the perspective of the women of offshore workers. Our aim was (1) to
   examine the perceived features of living the 14/14 schedule, (2) explore
   women's coping strategies, and (3) investigate their views on the
   reconciliation of offshore work and partnership/family life. The women
   reported differentiated views on the benefits and costs associated with
   their living situation, and stated various coping strategies that
   facilitated psychosocial adaptation. Despite some burdens, overall, most
   of the women seemed to have adapted relatively favourably to their
   lifestyle. This was particularly eased by recent sociological and
   technological advances, e.g., improved communication technologies.},

Title = {China's regional vulnerability to drought and its mitigation strategies

Abstract = {Climate change may make extreme droughts more frequent with heavy
   economic losses in China. Thus, this study aims to evaluate China's
   regional vulnerability to drought and propose proper mitigation
   strategies for drought vulnerable areas. In this paper, an integrated
   index containing exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity is
   developed to measure regional vulnerability to drought, and it is
   calculated by the integrated approach which combines slacks-based
   measure (SBM) model in data envelopment analysis (DEA) with genetic
   algorithm-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Accordingly, 65 cities
   in Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces of China are chosen as
   the study area. The results show that Anhui and Henan are more
   vulnerable to drought, and the proportions of cities with inefficient
   resilience to drought in the two provinces are 64.7 \% and 55.6 \%
   respectively. Compared with coastal areas, the inland regions have more
   drought vulnerable cities. In addition, the cities in the south are less
   vulnerable to drought than those in the central and north regions.
   Meanwhile, we conclude that the integrated index can measure the
   efficiency of resilience to drought and reveal the causes of drought
   vulnerability. It also indicates that adequate investments in drought
   preparedness and promotion of water efficiency are the crucial ways for
   drought vulnerability reduction. Finally, this study proposes some
   policy recommendations to alleviate the impacts of drought under climate
   change.},

Abstract = {The fisheries for small pelagic species in Angola, Namibia and South
   Africa fulfil important social and economic roles but have undergone
   substantial changes in recent years, some of which are likely to be
   related to climate change. This assessment of vulnerability and possible
   adaptation options for the main stakeholder groups in these fisheries
   was based on a framework encompassing ecological, social and economic
   vulnerability and the broader economic and governance context of the
   countries. Information was gathered through stakeholder consultations
   and workshops as well as from published information. Adaptation options
   were identified primarily through consultation with stakeholders.
   Namibia was considered to have the most vulnerable fishery because of
   the poor state of the sardine population and limited alternatives.
   Angola and South Africa were estimated to be moderately vulnerable for
   different reasons. Alternative sources of livelihoods are scarce, and
   the wellbeing of stakeholders is highly dependent on the resilience and
   adaptive capacity of individual fishing companies. For land-based and
   sea-going workers (fulltime and permanent), skills improvement to
   increase their flexibility and employability within and beyond fisheries
   is a primary adaptation option. Key roles for governments include
   ensuring effective governance and facilitating sustainable economic
   development, especially in underdeveloped coastal areas.},

Title = {Coping Strategies to Deal with Environmental Variability and Extreme

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {6},
Pages = {823-846},

Abstract = {The Peruvian anchovy fishery is the largest worldwide in terms of
   catches. The fishery started during the mid 1950s, and since then it has
   been highly dependent on natural stock fluctuations, due to the
   sensitivity of anchovy stocks to ocean-climate variability. The main
   driver of anchovy stock variability is the El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO), and three extreme ENSO warm events were recorded in 1972-1973,
   1983-1984 and 1997-1998. This study investigates the evolution of coping
   strategies developed by the anchovy fisheries to deal with climate
   variability and extreme ENSO events. Results showed eight coping
   strategies to reduce impacts on the fishery. These included:
   decentralized installation of anchovy processing factories; simultaneous
   ownership of fishing fleet and processing factories; use of low-cost
   unloading facilities; opportunistic utilization of invading fish
   populations; low cost intensive monitoring; rapid flexible management;
   reduction of fishmeal price uncertainty through controlled production
   based on market demand; and decoupling of fishmeal prices from those of
   other protein-rich feed substitutes like soybean. This research shows
   that there are concrete lessons to be learned from successful
   adaptations to cope with climate change-related extreme climatic events
   that impact the supply of natural resources. The lessons can contribute
   to improved policies for coping with climate change in the commercial
   fishery sector.},

Title = {Community Perception and Adaptation to Climate Change in Coastal Areas
   of Mexico},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation is an increasingly important topic addressed
   in the face of the current and expected future impacts by climate change
   that the social, economic and ecological systems are experiencing
   worldwide. Despite the advances reported in the literature, adaptation
   to climate change is still considered a challenge to move from planning
   to the practical implementation of successful interventions. In this
   regard, identifying international key barriers, exchanges of experiences
   and lessons learned may facilitate the progress of the coasts'
   sustainable and resilient future. The coast of Mexico is an excellent
   study area. High population densities occur along the coastal zone,
   whose main economic activity is related to primary and tertiary sectors.
   Additionally, a great diversity of coastal ecosystems exists, which are
   threatened by anthropogenic and hydrometeorological impacts. Under these
   circumstances, the population is becoming aware of the urgent need to
   adapt to the consequences of climate change. In this sense, this paper
   reviews research contributions concerning population perception to
   climate change and adaptation strategies in Mexico's coastal zone. The
   findings highlight critical institutional difficulties and social
   barriers that have impeded the effective implementation of adaptation
   strategies to climate change in Mexico and consider steps to address
   them. However, adaptation strategies that show the prevention culture of
   some coastal communities have been found and also results of successful
   projects carried out, especially on mangrove forest and coral reef
   restoration, which are of essential importance to consider to progress
   on the path of a successful adaptation to climate change in Mexico.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a participatory Multi-Criteria Assessment (MCA)
   methodology developed through the Resilience Increasing Strategies for
   Coasts Toolkit (RISC-KIT) project and implemented in nine case studies
   in Europe. The purpose of the MCA was to bridge the disciplinary divide
   between engineering sciences and social sciences, facilitate the
   communication and dissemination of local coastal risk assessments and
   Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures' evaluation to a broad range of
   actors. The process addressed the importance of integrating scientific
   knowledge with stakeholders' knowledge to understand and assess the
   possible social, political and economic implications of different DRR
   measures, which could foster or hinder successful implementation. The
   paper discusses the methodological aspects and implementation of the
   approach which included visualizing risk reduction of DRR measures using
   paper-based cards to support interaction and negotiation among

Abstract = {The protection, restoration, management, and sustainable use of natural
   and modified ecosystems to address climate change mitigation have
   received much global attention in recent years. Those types of actions
   are, however, often not designed to also address other global
   challenges, and so they miss an opportunity to provide important
   non-mitigation benefits and compromise their mitigation potential. Here,
   we highlight the importance of planning Nature-based Solutions for
   mitigation while considering the suite of global challenges that
   societies face, and we propose a set of considerations to ensure that
   those types of solutions also provide climate adaptation, biodiversity,
   and/or human well-being benefits. Planning Nature-based Solutions for
   climate mitigation that can also address other global challenges is very
   timely because every nature-based effort should grasp the opportunity to
   address a variety of pressing issues in order to allow for the continued
   delivery of mitigation and other benefits in this critical decade.},

Abstract = {Climate change has a different impact on each member of society. To
   reduce the damage caused by climate change, adaptation activities are
   being initiated, such as expanding the capacity of social
   infrastructures, and each stakeholder wants these adaptations to work in
   his or her favor. Therefore, a methodology is needed to determine
   adaptation measures that are most beneficial to all members of society.
   In this paper, a framework is proposed for producing an adaptation
   strategy that minimizes conflict between stakeholders. This framework
   casts the process of organizing climate change adaptations as a game and
   defines each community member as a stakeholder, each adaptation measure
   as a strategy, and the minimization of loss from future climate change
   as a payoff. In a case study involving sea level rise in Suncheon Bay,
   Korea, this framework is used to generate an optimal plan for minimizing
   conflicts while considering the losses of the central government, local
   governments, and local communities. The game theoretic results from the
   proposed framework enable a balanced distribution of responsibilities
   among stakeholders to achieve infrastructure adaptation to climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Warming of the earth is considered as the major adverse effect of
   climate change along with other abnormalities such as nonavailability of
   water resources, decreased agriculture production, food security, rise
   in seawater level, glaciers melting, and loss of biodiversity. Over the
   years, decreased agriculture production and water quality degradation
   have been observed due to climatic abnormalities. Crop production is
   highly sensitive to climate. It gets affected by long-term trends in
   average rainfall and temperature, annual climate variations, shocks
   during different stages of growth, and extreme weather events. Globally,
   the areas sown for the major crops of barley, maize, rice, sorghum, soya
   bean, and wheat have all seen an increase in the percentage of area
   affected by drought as defined in terms of the Palmer Drought Severity
   Index since the 1960s, from approximately 5-10\% to approximately
   15-25\%. Increase in temperature will be observed in terms of wheat
   yield losses - 5.5 +/- 4.4\% per degree Celsius for the United States, -
   9.1 +/- 5.4\% per degree Celsius for India, and - 7.8 +/- 6.3\% per
   degree Celsius for Russia as these countries are more vulnerable to
   temperature increase. Water management through increasing storage
   capacity (or rainwater storage), fair policies for water supply and
   distribution, river health, and watershed management can reduce the
   negative effects of climate change on water resource availability.
   Similarly, climate change-resistant crop development, water management
   in irrigation, adapting climate-smart agriculture approach, and
   promoting indigenous knowledge can ensure the food security via
   increasing agricultural yield. Technical intervention can equip the
   farmers with the scientific analyses of the climatic parameters required
   for the sustainable agriculture management. These technologies may
   include application of software, nutrient management, water management
   practices, instruments for temperature measurement and soil health
   analysis etc. Holistic efforts of the stakeholders (farmers, local
   society, academia, scientists, policy makers, NGOs etc.) can provide
   better results to reduce the risks of climate change on agriculture and
   water resources as discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Learning about ecosystem processes and patterns is an essential
   component of Ecosystem Based Fishery Management and the sustainable use
   of natural resources.
   Currently, such learning is usually done through adaptive management
   (passive or active) or Management Strategy Evaluation, which are
   explained. An example of adaptive management in northwestern Australia
   shows the strengths and limitations of management experiments and raises
   the question of how to learn if an experiment is not practicable. Both
   adaptive management and Management Strategy Evaluation are examples of
   scientific inference, an idea introduced by Sir Harold Jeffreys nearly
   80 years ago. With sufficient variation, even if it is not through
   controlled experiments, scientific inference is possible by combining
   mechanistic models with statistical methods; the recently proposed
   paradigm of `adaptive monitoring' is another case of scientific
   inference. The decline of Steller sea lions in the Bering Sea and
   Aleutian Islands is reviewed, including the only work in which 10
   hypotheses concerning the decline were simultaneously compared. It is
   concluded that scientific inference using mechanistic models and fine
   scale data at the level of the rookery can provide useful information
   about the interactions of fisheries, fish populations, and Steller sea
   lions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rural coastal fishery systems in tropical island nations are undergoing
   rapid change. Using a case study from eastern Sri Lanka, this paper
   examines the ways in which indigenous Coastal-Vedda fishers experience
   and respond to such change. We conducted semi-structured interviews (n =
   74), focus group discussions (n = 17, 98 participants), and key
   informant interviews (n = 38) over a 2-year period (2016-2019). The
   changes that most Coastal-Vedda fishers experience are disturbance from
   Sri Lankan ethnic war, changes in climate and the frequency and severity
   of natural disasters, increased frequency of human-elephant conflicts,
   increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, and transformation of the
   Coastal-Vedda due to social modernisation. We used a resilience-based
   conceptual framework focusing on place, human agency, collective action
   and collaboration, institutions, indigenous and local knowledge systems,
   and learning to examine fishers' responses to rapid changes. We
   identified three community-level adaptive strategies used by the
   Coastal-Vedda: adaptive institutions with a multi-level institutional
   structure that facilitates collective action and collaboration, the use
   of culture-based fisheries (CBF), and diversification of livelihoods. We
   also recognized four place-specific attributes that shaped community
   adaptations: cultural identity and worldviews, co-management of CBF,
   flexibility in choosing adaptive options, and indigenous and local
   knowledge systems and learning. These adaptive strategies and
   place-specific attributes provide new insights for scientists,
   policymakers, and communities in the region, enabling them to more
   effectively work together to support community adaptation.},

Abstract = {In this article, we compare four fishing-based areas in Thailand and the
   Philippines to examine if and how small-scale fishing communities are
   able to escape marginalisation. Three questions guide our inquiry: (i)
   How have fishing communities been affected by overfishing, climate
   change and other pressures? (ii) What adaptive strategies have these
   communities employed to mitigate socio-economic and environmental
   challenges? (iii) What has been the impact of these strategies on
   (escaping) marginalisation? Through a survey of 393 fishing-based
   households and semi-structured interviews with 59 key informants we find
   an uneven mixture of drivers, strategies and impacts. Respondents
   varyingly attribute declining fish catch to illegal fishing,
   overfishing, population increase, climate change and pollution. The case
   studies illustrate various degrees of adaptive successes that result
   from integration of top-down and bottom-up initiatives, and availability
   and access to livelihood strategies. However, the impact of adaptive
   strategies on overcoming marginalisation remains meagre and constrained
   by, among others, the power of illegal and commercial fishing and the
   absence of integrated spatial planning. We call for policy interventions
   and further research that takes into account the integration of top-down
   and bottom-up institutions, and the multiple dimensions and spaces of
   the drivers that shape fisherfolk marginalisation.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation Tool for Transportation: Mid-Atlantic Region
   Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING},

Volume = {139},

Abstract = {Transportation has contributed to climate change and will most likely be
   impacted by changes in sea level, temperature, precipitation, and wind,
   for example. As the risk of climate change impacts become more imminent,
   pressure for adaptation within transportation agencies to address these
   impacts continues to rise. The most logical strategy is to integrate
   consideration of adaptation projects into the long-range transportation
   planning (LRTP) process. To do this, tools and experience are needed to
   assist transportation agencies. The Climate Change Adaptation Tool for
   Transportation (CCATT) is a step-by-step method to evaluate climate
   change scenarios and impacts, inventory at-risk existing and proposed
   infrastructure, and assess mitigation practices to identify supporting
   adaptation efforts. This paper focuses on the application of CCATT to
   the Mid-Atlantic region using a case study on the Wilmington Area
   Planning Council (WILMAPCO), the Metropolitan Planning Organization for
   northern Delaware. The results of the application and case study
   demonstrate the importance of climate change adaptation practices in
   long-range transportation planning. DOI:

Abstract = {This paper attempts to provide an empirical application of the enhanced
   Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework using a case study of
   Mombasa Kenya. Climate variability is a challenge to tourism
   destinations, especially coastal and Island destinations, categories
   under which Mombasa, our study site falls under. Mombasa has limited
   capacity to adapt to climate change considering its socio economic
   conditions and weak institutions, thus making it necessary to explore
   the possible sustainable pathways for the city using the enhanced
   Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework. Earlier frameworks
   for tourism adaptation to climate change lacked focus on regional
   dynamics as well as sustainability aspects, and their implementation
   pose the risk of mal adaptation to some extent. Using secondary data and
   data from interviews with tourism stakeholders in Mombasa, the enhanced
   Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework guides our assessment
   of vulnerability and resilience of the destination, as well as
   identification of region specific adaptation options for the city within
   the context of sustainable practice. Based on climate change perceived
   impacts, risks and vulnerability various adaptation options are
   presented and discussed as provided in literature. The usefulness of the
   framework in guiding regional tourism destination managers and policy
   makers in their pursuit for a regional adaptation options within the
   tourism sector in order to reduce destinations vulnerability, increase
   resilience and take advantage of opportunities presented by climate
   change is underscored.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-112},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Because they contribute little to climate change, fisheries, aquaculture
   and other uses of marine renewable resources and environment have
   limited means to mitigate climate impacts. Adaptation is, therefore,
   critical. Though likely effects on oceans and fisheries can be
   identified, few can be quantified and, thus, priorized. Consequently,
   adaptation strategies should aim at enhancing the resilience of marine
   renewable resources and their uses and the current capacity to respond
   to surprises. Already, these uses are characterized by massive
   over-capacities, excessive resource exploitation, and pervasive
   conflicts within and between uses. Two complementary adaptation
   strategies are available. The first consists in adjusting conventional
   management systems to the new conditions of resource scarcity. The
   second aims at reducing the current resource constraint by promoting the
   development of aquaculture and a better utilization of fishery and
   aquaculture harvests. In this respect, small-scale and large-scale
   production systems, and developing and developed countries, have
   different capabilities. In summary, climate change does not modify, but
   enhances, existing priorities of environment and fisheries management
   and aquaculture development.},

Title = {Increase of the transient climate response to cumulative carbon
   emissions with decreasing CO2 concentration scenarios},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Near-constancy of the transient climate response to cumulative carbon
   emissions (TCRE) facilitates the development of future emission pathways
   compatible with temperature targets. However, most studies have explored
   TCRE under scenarios of temperature increase. We used an Earth system
   model (MIROC-ESM) to examine TCRE in scenarios with increasing and
   stable CO2 concentrations, as well as overshoot pathways in which global
   mean temperatures peak and decline. Results showed that TCRE is stable
   under scenarios of increasing or stable CO2 concentration at an
   atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO2) double the pre-industrial level.
   However, in the case of overshoot pathways and a stable pCO2 scenario at
   a quadrupledpCO2 level, the TCRE increases by 10\%-50\%, with large
   increases over a short period just after pCO2 starts to decrease. During
   the period ofpCO2 increase, annual ocean heat uptake (OHU) and ocean
   carbon storage (Co) (or cumulative ocean carbon uptake from the start of
   the experiment) exhibit similar changes, resulting in a stable TCRE.
   During the pCO2 decrease period, after a sudden TCRE increase when pCO2
   starts to decrease, the OHU decreases and Co increases (relative to the
   pCO2 increase period) balance each other out, resulting in a stable
   TCRE. In overshoot pathways, the temperature distribution when the
   global mean temperature anomaly cools to 1.5 C reveals small warming
   over land and large warming over the oceans relative to the 1\% per
   annum pCO2 increasing scenario, particularly in some high-latitude areas
   ofboth hemispheres. The increase in TCRE with overshoot pathways
   decreases the carbon budget for the temperature anomaly targets in such
   scenarios. Our analysis showed a 16\%-35\% decrease in the remaining
   carbon budget for the 1.5 C global warming target, in comparison with
   the reference scenario with a 1\% per year pCO2 increase, for pathways
   peaking at the doubledpCO2 level followed by decline to the
   pre-industrial level.},

Title = {The government-led climate change adaptation landscape in Nunavut,
   Canada},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {12-25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Canadian Arctic is uniquely sensitive to climate change impacts,
   including rapidly warming temperatures, sea ice change, and permafrost
   degradation. Adaptation-including efforts to manage climate change
   risks, reduce damages, and take advantage of new opportunities-has been
   identified as a priority for policy action across government levels.
   However, our understanding of adaptation in the Canadian North is
   limited: Is adaptation taking place, to what stresses, and what does it
   look like? In this paper we answer these questions for the Inuit
   territory of Nunavut, systematically cataloguing and reviewing
   government-led adaptation programs and policies at community,
   territorial, and federal levels, drawing on publically available
   information. We documented a total of 700 discrete adaptation
   initiatives. The focus on adaptation to-date has primarily been at the
   groundwork level, aimed at informing and preparing for adaptation
   through impact assessments, adaptation planning exercises, and
   stakeholder engagement. Adaptation in Nunavut has been driven by
   cross-scale coordination and leadership from the territorial and federal
   government. Our study finds few examples of concrete actions for planned
   adaptation, such as changes to or creation of policies that enable
   adaptation, alterations to building codes and infrastructure design with
   changing geohazards, or enhanced disaster planning and emergency
   preparedness in light of projected impacts. This study indicates a need
   for formal adaptation plans for the Governments of Canada and Nunavut,
   emphasis on adaptation monitoring and evaluation, and a greater role of
   Inuit traditional knowledge and cultural values in adaptation policy.},

Abstract = {Purpose The small-scale artisanal fishers in coastal Bangladesh are
   comparatively more vulnerable to climate risks than any other
   communities in Bangladesh. Based on practicality, this paper aims to
   explain the local level climate change perception, its impact and
   adaptation strategies of the fisher in southeast coastal villages in
   Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the above objective,
   this study used structural, semi-structured interviews and focus group
   discussion in two coastal communities, namely, at Salimpur in the
   Sitakund coast and Sarikait Sandwip Island, Bangladesh. It reviews and
   applies secondary data sources to compare and contrast the findings
   presented in this study. Findings Results show that the fishers
   perceived an increase in temperature, frequency of tropical cyclones and
   an increase in sea level. They also perceived a decrease in monsoon
   rainfall. Such changes impact the decreasing amount of fish in the Bay
   of Bengal and the fishers' livelihood options. Analysing seasonal
   calendar of fishing, findings suggest that fishers' well-being is highly
   associated with the amount of fish yield, rather than climatic stress,
   certain non-climatic factors (such as the governmental rules, less
   profit, bank erosion and commercial fishing) also affected their
   livelihood. The major adaptation strategies undertaken include, but are
   not limited to, installation of tube well or rainwater harvesting plant
   for safe drinking water, raising plinth of the house to cope with
   inundation and use of solar panel/biogas for electricity.
   Originality/value Despite experiencing social stress and extreme
   climatic events and disasters, the majority of the fishing community
   expressed that they would not change their profession in future. The
   research suggests implementing risk reduction strategies in the coastal
   region of Bangladesh that supports the small-scale fishers to sustain
   their livelihood despite climate change consequences.},

Title = {Adjusting Mitigation Pathways to Stabilize Climate at 1.5 degrees C and

Abstract = {To avoid the most dangerous consequences of anthropogenic climate
   change, the Paris Agreement provides a clear and agreed climate
   mitigation target of stabilizing global surface warming to under 2.0
   degrees C above preindustrial, and preferably closer to 1.5 degrees C.
   However, policy makers do not currently know exactly what carbon
   emissions pathways to follow to stabilize warming below these agreed
   targets, because there is large uncertainty in future temperature rise
   for any given pathway. This large uncertainty makes it difficult for a
   cautious policy maker to avoid either: (1) allowing warming to exceed
   the agreed target or (2) cutting global emissions more than is required
   to satisfy the agreed target, and their associated societal costs. This
   study presents a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach to
   restrict future warming to policy-driven targets, in which future
   emissions reductions are not fully determined now but respond to future
   surface warming each decade in a self-adjusting manner. A large ensemble
   of Earth system model simulations, constrained by geological and
   historical observations of past climate change, demonstrates our
   self-adjusting mitigation approach for a range of climate stabilization
   targets ranging from 1.5 degrees C to 4.5 degrees C, and generates AMP
   scenarios up to year 2300 for surface warming, carbon emissions,
   atmospheric CO2, global mean sea level, and surface ocean acidification.
   We find that lower 21st century warming targets will significantly
   reduce ocean acidification this century, and will avoid up to 4 m of
   sea-level rise by year 2300 relative to a high-end scenario.},

Title = {Climate change risk perceptions and agricultural adaptation strategies
   in vulnerable riverine char islands of Bangladesh},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Farmers in the riverine char islands of Bangladesh are frequently
   affected by climate change due to their proximity to the river and heavy
   reliance on agriculture for their livelihoods. The present study
   evaluates char dwellers? risk perceptions and agricultural adaptations
   to climate change. Survey data were collected from 98 households, and
   focus group discussions were conducted using a semi-structured
   questionnaire from Rydas Bari char under the Gaibandha District of
   Bangladesh. A standardized risk perception index was created using a
   four point Likert scale against sixteen climatic events. In addition, a
   binary logit model was used to estimate the influence of socioeconomic
   characteristics of sample households on the decision to choose climate
   change adaptation strategies. Findings suggest that droughts, river
   erosion, and floods are the major climatic risks perceived by char
   dwellers. Additionally, results from a climate vulnerability index
   portray similar findings that char respondents are more exposed to
   diverse climatic hazards. The study further investigates local
   adaptation mechanisms in agriculture with regards to major climatic
   events. In response to the existing climate change risks, the char
   inhabitants employ several adaptation strategies in agriculture such as
   implementing new or alternative farming practices, changing planting
   times, and cultivating short-duration varieties. The llogit analysis
   suggests that household age, family size, annual income, farm size, farm
   ownership and farming experience have a significant influence on
   farmers? adaptation choices. Household access to education, early
   warning by extension agents, information on improved agricultural
   technologies, access to off-farm sources of income and incorporating
   char people during policy design can effectively enhance farmers?
   resilience and help reduce vulnerability.},

   Assessment: A Case Study on Yunlin Coast, Taiwan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A coastal erosion risk assessment was framed as the basis for the
   intervention of coastal adaptation strategies under time-variant
   scenarios. The framework was devised to assess the influence of coastal
   erosion on coastal defense, the coastal inundation induced by the
   erosion-induced malfunction of defense, and risks using a downscaling
   analysis and the mechanism of the compound hazard interaction, which are
   innovative and practical for the application of coastal management in
   Taiwan. In addition, the vulnerable socio-economy was also taken into
   consideration in risk assessment. The adaptive strategy is proposed in
   terms of the risk origins and time-variance of risk forecasts, and the
   risk origins were assessed based on the Fuzzy Delphi Method and the
   analytic hierarchy process instead of subjective consideration. Within
   the erosion-induced hazard and risk assessments, this study considered
   erosion rates, decreases in defense elevation due to land subsidence,
   and population development in time-variant scenario analyses to estimate
   risk forecasts. Furthermore, a case study of the Yunlin coastal area was
   undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The
   presented results are informative for coastal hazard reduction and the
   promotion of the sustainable development of coastal zones.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Volume = {75},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are inimitable in view of their frailty as compared
   to terrestrial ecosystems, and yet in their indispensability in
   preserving the terrestrial ecosystems being the first line of defence
   against hazards of oceanic origin. More often than not, these are more
   precious in terms of their natural, built, human and social capitals
   over land ecosystems; and yet more often than not these are subjected to
   ill considerate and unbridled anthropogenic stresses for gaining entree
   to these capitals. The human `undoings' albeit enhancement in climate
   change-induced degenerative-and often cataclysmic-marine influences in
   form of tropical and extratropical cyclones, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.
   are only adding to the woes in so far as the stability of the coastal
   ecosystems-and their very existence as well-is concerned. In view of
   these impending threats on various coastal habitats due to increasing
   occurrence as well as ferocity of oceanic hazards coupled with
   anthropogenic stresses, adaptation and mitigation measures are called
   for to resuscitate and rejuvenate coastal landforms. Since man cannot
   dictate over nature, adaptation measures are necessitated to `Better
   live with' the nature's furies while mitigation is required to `Better
   deal with' the human-induced pressures. The present paper aims at (1)
   reviewing the role of climate change in increasing occurrences of
   oceanic hazards threatening the coastal ecosystems and (2) invoke
   perspicacious and percipient adaptation and mitigation measures to
   better deal with and live with these Nature's perils.},

Title = {Climatic disasters within a flood-prone coastal slum in Lagos: coping
   capacities and adaptation prospects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose Climate impacts are a significant challenge in slums and
   informal settlements, most of which are located along the coast. This
   article aims to show coping strategies and flood adaptation
   opportunities through the case study of a coastal slum in Lagos,
   Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach is used in
   Idi-Araba settlement, Oworonshoki, Lagos - the case study area. Data
   collection involved semi-structured interviews with 15 purposively
   selected residents and a survey (sample size = 300 residents). A town
   hall meeting was convened to disseminate the findings and gather
   feedback from the community. Findings Being an informally developed
   settlement, flooding affects the poor-quality buildings - a situation
   made worse by absence of infrastructure and services. Coping with
   flooding involves structural strategies (raising building's foundation,
   re-roofing, sand-filling the surrounding, etc.), failed attempt through
   green infrastructure, nonstructural measures through dietary pattern,
   dressing, etc. These measures emanate from self-help and community
   efforts, attesting to notable social capital in the study area. They are
   minimally effective and limited, which highlights adaptation gaps and
   opportunities. Research limitations/implications This study calls for
   transformative adaptation, beyond the current coping and maladaptation.
   It argues that local strategies need to meet with innovative substantive
   external initiatives from the state and third sector. Originality/value
   This study considers the single case of a coastal settlement in Lagos.
   This focus allowed detailed examination within a representative
   settlement, much unlike city-wide, cross-settlement considerations in
   many other studies. It provides additional empirical evidence on
   limitations of self-help flood coping measures and adaptation prospects
   in the often overlooked low-income, informal urban sector.},

Title = {A Perspective on Biofuels Use and CCS for GHG Mitigation in the Marine
   Sector},
Journal = {ISCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the marine sector were around
   2.6\% of world GHG emissions in 2015 and are expected to increase
   50\%-250\% to 2050 under a ``business as usual'' scenario, making the
   decarbonization of this fossil fuel-intensive sector an urgent priority.
   Biofuels, which come in various forms, are one of the most promising
   options to replace existing marine fuels for accomplishing this in the
   short to medium term. Some unique challenges, however, impede biofuels
   penetration in the shipping sector, including the low cost of the
   existing fuels, the extensive present-day refueling infrastructure, and
   the exclusion of the sector from the Paris climate agreement. To address
   this, it is necessary to first identify those biofuels best suited for
   deployment as marine fuel. In this work, the long list of possible
   biofuel candidates has been narrowed down to four high-potential
   options-bio-methanol, bio-dimethyl ether, bio-liquefied natural gas, and
   bio-oil. These options are further evaluated based on six criteria-cost,
   potential availability, present technology status, GHG mitigation
   potential, infrastructure compatibility, and carbon capture and storage
   (CCS) compatibility-via both an extensive literature review and
   stakeholder discussions. These four candidates turn out to be relatively
   evenly matched overall, but each possesses certain strengths and
   shortcomings that could favor that fuel under specific circumstances,
   such as if compatibility with existing shipping infrastructure or with
   CCS deployment become pivotal requirements. Furthermore, we pay
   particular attention to the possibility of integrating deployment of
   these biofuels with CCS to further reduce marine sector emissions. It is
   shown that this aspect is presently not on the radar of the industry
   stakeholders but is likely to grow in importance as CCS acceptability
   increases in the broader green energy sector.},

Title = {Community-based disaster risk and vulnerability models of a coastal
   municipality in Bangladesh},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is one of the most natural hazard-prone countries in the
   world with the greatest negative consequences being associated with
   cyclones, devastating floods, riverbank erosion, drought, earthquake,
   and arsenic contamination, etc. One way or other, these natural hazards
   engulfed every corner of Bangladesh. The main aim of this research paper
   is to carry out a multi-hazards risk and vulnerability assessment for
   the coastal Matlab municipality in Bangladesh and to recommend possible
   mitigation measures. To this aim, hazards are prioritized by integrating
   SMUG and FEMA models, and a participation process is implemented so as
   to involve community both in the risk assessment and in the
   identification of adaptation strategies. The Matlab municipality is
   highly vulnerable to several natural hazards such as cyclones, floods,
   and riverbank erosion. The SMUG is a qualitative assessment, while FEMA
   is a quantitative assessment of hazards. The FEMA model suggests a
   threshold of highest 100 points. All hazards that total more than 100
   points may receive higher priority in emergency preparedness and
   mitigation measures. The FEMA model, because it judges each hazard
   individually in a numerical manner, may provide more satisfying results
   than the SMUG system. The spatial distributions of hazard, risk, social
   institutions, land use, and other resources indicate that the flood
   disaster is the top environmental problem of Matlab municipality.
   Hazard-specific probable mitigation measures are recommended with the
   discussion of local community. Finally, this study tries to provide
   insights into the way field research combining scientific assessments
   tools such as SMUG and FEMA could feed evidence-based decision-making
   processes for mitigation in vulnerable communities.},

Abstract = {Climate change projections necessarily involve uncertainty. Analysis of
   the physics and mathematics of the climate system reveals that greater
   uncertainty about future temperature increases is nearly always
   associated with greater expected damages from climate change. In
   contrast to those normative constraints, uncertainty is frequently cited
   in public discourse as a reason to delay mitigative action. This failure
   to understand the actual implications of uncertainty may incur notable
   future costs. It is therefore important to communicate uncertainty in a
   way that improves people's understanding of climate change risks. We
   examined whether responses to projections were influenced by whether the
   projection emphasized uncertainty in the outcome or in its time of
   arrival. We presented participants with statements and graphs indicating
   projected increases in temperature, sea levels, ocean acidification and
   a decrease in arctic sea ice. In the uncertain-outcome condition,
   statements reported the upper and lower confidence bounds of the
   projected outcome at a fixed time point. In the uncertain
   time-of-arrival condition, statements reported the upper and lower
   confidence bounds of the projected time of arrival for a fixed outcome.
   Results suggested that people perceived the threat as more serious and
   were more likely to encourage mitigative action in the time-uncertain
   condition than in the outcome-uncertain condition. This finding has
   implications for effectively communicating the climate change risks to
   policy-makers and the general public.},

Journal = {TOURISM PLANNING \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {300-320},
Abstract = {This study examines tourist attitudes towards various climate change
   adaptations for regional tourism destinations. This research took a
   single case-study approach, which involved a survey of visitors to the
   Surf Coast region of Australia. Analysis was carried out to determine
   visitor preferences for various adaptation options. In addition,
   knowledge of climate change and adaptation, as well as demographic
   information such as age, gender and nationality were collected.
   Psychographic segmentation using the New Ecological Paradigm was also
   used to enable researchers to identify ecocentric respondents, who were
   more likely to be classified as ``green{''} consumers. The results show
   that visitors to the Surf Coast felt that they had only average
   knowledge of climate change and even less knowledge of climate change
   adaptation. Interestingly, the self-reported knowledge of climate change
   issues was significantly lower for ecocentric respondents, when compared
   to anthropocentric respondents. This may indicate that ecocentric
   respondents acknowledge the shortcomings in both their knowledge and
   understanding of climate change issues. When presented with potential
   adaptation options the overall results showed a positive opinion for
   five of the seven options presented, with the provision of early warning
   systems for extreme events receiving the most positive overall response.},

Abstract = {The climate of a city influences the ways in which its outdoor spaces
   are used. Especially, public spaces intended for use by pedestrians and
   cyclists, such as parks, squares, residential and commercial streets,
   and foot and cycle paths will be used and enjoyed more frequently if
   they have a comfortable and healthy climate. Due to the predicted global
   temperature increase, urban climate is likely to become more
   uncomfortable, especially in summer when an increase in heat stress is
   expected. Urban forestry has been proposed as one approach for
   mitigating the human health consequences of increased temperature
   resulting from climate change. The aims of the current research were to
   (a) provide a transferable methodology useful for analyzing the effect
   of urban trees on surface temperature reduction, particularly in public
   spaces, and (b) provide high-resolution urban mapping for adaptation
   strategies to climate change based on green space projects. To achieve
   the established aims, we developed a methodology that uses multisource
   data: LiDAR data, high-resolution Landsat imagery, global climate model
   data from CMIP5 (IPPC Fifth Assessment), and data from meteorological
   stations. The proposed model can be a useful tool for validating the
   efficiency of design simulations of new green spaces for temperature
   mitigation.},

Journal = {GEOFORUM},

Volume = {56},
Pages = {201-210},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Adjustment to predicted environmental change in a place requires people
   in that place to consider short- and long-term futures there. These
   futures are imagined with reference to pasts and presents, remembered
   and lived. This paper presents the stories relating possible futures to
   pasts and presents of residents in tiny, low-lying coastal communities
   in Gippsland East, Australia, as they make sense of the uncertain
   futures they may face. It identifies four time stories, about
   generational continuity, the temporariness of inundation, endurance and
   acceptance in older age, and the impermanence of infrastructure. It sets
   these alongside the time-based practices inherent in existing adaptation
   policies, which do not satisfy the demands for adaptation arising from
   residents' time stories. We suggest that understanding local residents'
   time stories can contribute to a better synchronisation in the timing of
   local adaptation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the effectiveness of climate change adaptation
   strategies in Berlin, Germany, on a summer day by using the urban

   of both are analysed regarding their cooling ability on the 2
   m-temperature. Additionally, horizontal and vertical compactness are
   evaluated in terms of their respective impact on the micro climate. An
   enhanced albedo of the urban surfaces leads to the highest cooling
   ability with a significant daily average cooling of 0.2 K per 0.1
   increase of albedo, while green roofs have only a small cooling effect
   at pedestrian level. An increased vertical compactness has a cooling
   ability due to the higher amount of shading, enhanced horizontal
   compactness shows a negative impact on the micro climate due to the
   raised percentage of sealed surfaces and the additional urban structures
   that can emit additional heat during the night. All strategies show a
   higher effect on the daytime and a smaller influence on the nocturnal
   temperature.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the concept of adaptation within the shoreline
   management framework in England and Wales. In the future it may not be
   sustainable to continue to defend all the locations on the coast that
   presently benefit from defences. Adaptation can help deliver more
   sustainable shoreline management solutions that better manage the risks
   to the social, economic and environmental function of the coast.
   Planning for adaptation will require preparing coastal communities for
   future change and will involve building in flexibility rather than
   closing off future solutions. A number of case studies are presented
   which exemplify different aspects of adaptation. The paper demonstrates
   how future reviews of Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) could promote
   more adaptive measures linked to the Coastal Change Management Areas
   that will feature in the next revision of land use plans. The future
   challenges to delivering more adaptive solutions are considered by
   looking at where adaptation may be needed, what more adaptive approaches
   may look like, and what the barriers to implementation are. One critical
   area is the greater engagement of local communities and the paper shows
   how the recent Coastal Pathfinder projects are tackling this issue. The
   lessons learned from these projects will be invaluable in rolling out
   adaptive solutions to other areas in the future. Such solutions can be
   progressed within the policies laid down in the current SMPs but should
   be updated in future SMP reviews as new information and knowledge
   becomes available.},

Abstract = {The natural attributes of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO world
   heritage site listed for its natural beauty and biological diversity,
   are rapidly declining due to major threats from diffuse water pollution
   and climate change. The environmental, social, political and legal
   conditions that have enabled or blocked successful management of diffuse
   water pollution are analyzed. We find that the management approach has
   transitioned towards resilience-focused adaptive management of impacts
   from outside the marine park. Despite key enablers of adaptive
   governance, deep-seated political ideology is a major barrier to
   transformational adaptive governance to improve reef water quality.},

Abstract = {Farming freshwater prawns with fish in rice fields is widespread in the
   coastal region of southwest Bangladesh because of favourable resources
   and ecological conditions. This article provides an overview of an
   ecosystem-based approach to integrated prawn-fish-rice farming in
   southwest Bangladesh. The practice of prawn and fish farming in rice
   fields is a form of integrated aquaculture-agriculture, which provides a
   wide range of social, economic and environmental benefits. Integrated
   prawn-fish-rice farming plays an important role in the economy of
   Bangladesh, earning foreign exchange and increasing food production.
   However, this unique farming system in coastal Bangladesh is
   particularly vulnerable to climate change. We suggest that
   community-based adaptation strategies must be developed to cope with the
   challenges. We propose that integrated prawn-fish-rice farming could be
   relocated from the coastal region to less vulnerable inland areas, but
   caution that this will require appropriate adaptation strategies and an
   enabling institutional environment.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change in geographically isolated, peripheral
   coastal communities holds particular challenges. In the CoastAdapt
   project a common approach was applied to support climate change
   adaptation in study sites in peripheral regions of Northwest Europe
   (Scotland, Ireland, Norway and Iceland). This involved a series of
   workshops at each site to describe the nature of future climate change,
   identify site-specific climate-change-related issues and explore
   adaptation options. While there are common issues related to the impacts
   of sea level rise, other aspects tend to be site and time-specific. The
   occurrence of recent high impact events (storms or floods), in
   particular, exert a strong influence on community perceptions. The
   studies reveal that availability of resources, knowledge of options (and
   their implications), and the particular governance framework in
   operation are major determinants of the adaptation options selected. (C)

Title = {Wind disasters adaptation in cities in a changing climate: A systematic
   review},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Wind-related disasters will bring more devastating consequences to
   cities in the future with a changing climate, but relevant studies have
   so far provided insufficient information to guide adaptation actions.
   This study aims to provide an in-depth elaboration of the contents
   discussed in open access literature regarding wind disaster adaptation
   in cities. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to refine
   topics and main contents based on 232 publications (1900 to 2019)
   extracted from Web of Science and Scopus. We conducted a full-text
   analysis to filter out focal cities along with their adaptation
   measures. The results show that wind disaster adaptation research in
   cities has formed a systematic framework in four aspects: 1)
   vulnerability and resilience of cities, 2) damage evaluation, 3)
   response and recovery, and 4) health impacts of wind disaster. Climate
   change is the background for many articles discussing vulnerability and
   adaptation in coastal areas. It is also embedded in damage evaluation
   since it has the potential to exacerbate disaster consequences. The
   literature is strongly inclined towards more developed cities such as
   New York City and New Orleans, among which New York City associated with
   Hurricane Sandy ranks first (38/232). Studies on New York City cover all
   the aspects, including the health impacts of wind disasters which are
   significantly less studied now. Distinct differences do exist in the
   number of measures regarding the adaptation categories and their
   subcategories. We also find that hard adaptation measures (i.e.,
   structural and physical measures) are far more popular than soft
   adaptation measures (i.e., social and institutional measures). Our
   findings suggest that policymakers should pay more attention to cities
   that have experienced major wind disasters other than New York. They
   should embrace the up-to-date climate change study to defend short-term
   disasters and take precautions against long-term changes. They should
   also develop hard-soft hybrid adaptation measures, with special
   attention on the soft side, and enhance the health impact study of
   wind-related disasters.},

Abstract = {Pacific Islanders who live on atolls are among the first people who have
   begun to be seriously impacted by the effects of global climate change.
   These are the people whose entire landscape is typically no higher than
   one meter above sea level. Extreme environmental changes are nothing new
   to these communities. Over many generations these atoll cultures have
   survived major, unpredictable and locally devastating changes that are
   of the same magnitude as those expected from climate changes. An
   examination of traditional ecological knowledge of Marshall Islanders at
   Rongelap atoll serves to illustrate some of the coping strategies that
   have enabled these people to be resilient in the past and in the current
   environmental crisis. Interviews revealed that these atoll dwellers
   actively manage the resources that are most likely to be impacted by
   climate change. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the representation of climate information in a way to
   support decision making has been gaining momentum. Worldwide, these
   so-called climate services are emerging as an essential tool to connect
   the advances in climate science with the domains of climate change
   adaptation. The methodology developed within the CLARITY project (funded
   through European Union funding program Horizon 2020) is aimed at
   implementing a new generation of climate services specifically designed
   to assess adaptation measures at the city level under the effects of
   extreme weather events in the context of climate change. These effects
   are assessed based on observations as well as climate projections, and
   the subsequent derivation of climate indices to address changes in
   climate extremes. The dynamical-statistical downscaling of regional
   climate model results is used to obtain this information on fine spatial
   scales (100 m), hence providing urban scale projections and enabling
   climate sensitivity simulations of adaptation measures on the urban
   scale. The climate adaptation strategies encompass, among others, green
   roofs, increasing roof albedo, as well as changes in soil sealing. Here,
   the climate assessment methodology developed within CLARITY will be
   discussed in detail, and results for the city of Linz (Austria)
   presented. In addition, the usage of these methods and results within
   the CLARITY climate service as well as the connection to urban climate
   change resilience will be highlighted.},

Abstract = {This article describes a climate change adaptation planning process
   triggered by a group of researchers and stakeholders in a context where
   no collective responses or long-term plans for protecting a vulnerable
   coastal system had been initiated, despite local perceptions of
   vulnerability and risk. The case study shows the application of two
   methods: scenario workshops and adaptation pathways in the context of a
   participatory action research methodological design. Participatory
   action research and qualitative scenario methods are highlighted as
   accelerators of climate change adaptation processes by calling to
   action, facilitating and connecting diverse social groups with a stake
   in a long-term plan towards a more adapted society. The experience leads
   to the conclusion that planning climate change adaptation has to go far
   beyond the technical dimension and take into account those affected (in
   the present and the future) by decisions made. A holistic approach to
   climate change adaptation planning will depend on the interrelations of
   managerial and top-down approaches with localized initiatives driven
   through an inclusive and collective action research process.},

Abstract = {The US state of Rhode Island (RI) offers a unique case for examining the
   conditions that hinder or facilitate coastal resilience efforts, due to
   its small size, active coastal program, and dynamic engagement of
   stakeholders. A five-decade corpus of information on hazard events,
   studies, plans and policies, and a database of more than 40,000 RI
   Coastal Resource Management Council (CRMC) permit decisions helps reveal
   patterns of decision-making related to coastal resilience. A social
   network map traces RI stakeholder engagement revealing hidden areas of
   resistance to resilience policies. Content analysis of documents and
   press coverage of decision-making in just one critical coastal area
   reveals 71 types of obstacles articulated by property owners and
   authorities. Current RI plans and studies are biased toward public
   engagement, filling information gaps, and designing new adaptation
   options. Deeper structural, financial and institutional sources of
   resistance to resilience remain and continue to be difficult to address.},

Abstract = {Fisheries in Sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to the effects of climate
   change, which include changes in mean temperature, increasing rainfall
   variability and the occurrence of extreme weather events. This article
   reviews evidence on the magnitude of climate change and the nature of
   its impacts on both inland and marine fisheries. In addition, the review
   also focuses on the impacts of climate change on fishery-dependent
   communities and finally highlights climate change adaptation strategies
   adopted by fishers. A systematic approach was employed to search and
   select relevant published literature used in this review paper. The
   reviewed literature indicated the challenge of declining fish catches in
   several fishing communities, which was associated with climate change
   and variability. Changes in mean temperature, rainfall quantities and
   patterns, sea-level changes, water salinity, and lake levels affect fish
   productivity. Fishers in sub-Saharan Africa adopt different strategies
   to sustain their livelihoods and food security, which are being
   threatened by climate change. Adaptation strategies employed by fishers
   to cope with the impacts of climate change include, changing fishing
   gear, migration, targeting new species, and increasing fishing grounds
   and time spent fishing. To promote socio-ecological adaptation and
   fisheries sustainability, it is crucial to understand the impacts of
   climate change at a local level, which would inform policy and fisheries
   management practices.},

Title = {Fisheries bycatch mitigation measures as an efficient tool for the
   conservation of seabird populations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1674-1685},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The impact of industrial fisheries on marine biodiversity is conspicuous
   in large pelagic vertebrate's fisheries bycatch. In seabirds, this led
   to the decline of many populations since the 1980s following the rise of
   global fishing effort. Bycatch mitigation measures were implemented
   since the 2000s, but their effects on the concerned seabird populations
   remain poorly quantified and understood. We studied the effects of
   bycatch mitigation measures on the demography of the white-chinned
   petrel, one of the most bycatch impacted seabirds whose populations
   suffered dramatic declines before the implementation of mitigation
   measures. To do so we (a) built multi-event capture-recapture models to
   estimate the demographic parameters of a population from Possession
   Island (southern Indian Ocean) over 30 years, (b) assessed the effect of
   climate and fishery covariates on demographic parameters, (c) built a
   population matrix model to estimate stochastic growth rate according to
   the management in fisheries bycatch and (d) estimated changes in
   breeding population density using distance sampling data. The population
   declined from the 1980s to the mid-2000s, while trawl and longline
   fisheries occurred with no bycatch mitigation measures. The negative
   effects of fishery bycatch through additive mortality and of rat
   predation on breeding success were likely the main drivers of this
   decline. Both modelled population growth rate and observed breeding
   densities showed an increase since the mid-2000s. We explained this
   trend by the improvement in survival probability following
   implementation of fishery bycatch mitigation measures and in breeding
   success probability with the local control of the rat population and
   changes in sea ice conditions on foraging grounds. Synthesis and
   applications. We provide a holistic approach to assess the effects of
   management measures by analysing datasets from sampling methods commonly
   employed in seabird studies. Our conclusions should encourage the
   eradication of invasive predatory species in seabird breeding areas and
   the strengthening of bycatch mitigation measures for the vulnerable
   seabird species, especially in international waters, but also the
   development of such measures considering the other marine large pelagic
   species threatened by fisheries bycatch (sharks, rays, turtles and
   marine mammals) since it could be crucial to avoid populations'
   extinction.},

Abstract = {Rise in temperature and annual precipitation, changes in seasonal
   rainfall patterns, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, and
   increased salinity in river water have been observed in Bangladesh in
   the recent years. Rising temperature will elevate total power
   consumption and peak power demand especially during the pre-monsoon hot
   summer season, reduce power plant efficiency and transformer lifetime,
   and increase the transmission loss. More frequent and severe extreme
   weather events may cause more disruption in power generation and
   distribution, and more damage of power infrastructure. Lower river flow
   in dry season may cause water scarcity in power plants and hamper the
   production. Increased salinity in river water due to sea level rise may
   lead to corrosion and leakages in power plants located in the coastal
   region of Bangladesh. A diversified, decentralized, and climate
   resilient power system can reduce negative impacts of climate change on
   power sector of Bangladesh. Adaptation and mitigation strategies must be
   incorporated in the planning and development of new power systems and
   the reformation of existing power systems of Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel interdisciplinary and catchment-based
   approach for exploring urban flood resilience. Our research identified
   and developed a diverse set of adaptation measures for Elwood, a suburb
   in Melbourne, Australia, that is vulnerable to pluvial and coastal
   flooding. We drew on methods from social science, urban design and
   environmental engineering to gain integrated insights into the
   opportunities for Elwood to increase its flood resilience and urban
   liveability. Results showed that an appropriate balance of social,
   infrastructural and urban design responses would be required to retreat
   from, accommodate and protect against flood risk. These would also
   deliver broader benefits such as securing water supplies through
   harvested stormwater and mitigating extreme heat through greener
   landscapes. Our interdisciplinary approach demonstrated the value of (i)
   engaging with the community to understand their concerns, aspirations
   and adaptation ideas, (ii) exploring design measures that densify and
   use urban forms in ways that implement adaptation measures while
   responding to local context, (iii) adopting modelling techniques to test
   the performance, robustness and economic viability of possible
   adaptation solutions, and (iv) innovating governance arrangements and
   principles needed to improve flood resilience in the Elster Creek
   catchment. Our research also provided valuable insight on how to
   operationalize interdisciplinary work in practice, highlighting the
   importance of sharing an impact agenda, taking a place-based approach,
   developing a common conceptual framework, and fostering a constructive
   team culture.

Abstract = {Sea-level rise, a consequence of climate change, is progressively
   affecting coastal areas around the globe. In turn, protected areas are
   keystones or protecting coastal biodiversity and the ecosystems services
   ensuring sustainable livelihoods. Effective management and adaptation
   plans are needed to maintain ecological function and integrity. In the
   present article, we used a coastal digital elevation model to simulate
   inundation surfaces and a prioritization index for ranking management
   interventions in 278 coastal protected areas from 27 African countries.
   Of these, 15 areas and eight countries demonstrated a high need for
   proactive management actions because of high levels of biodiversity,
   international conservation relevance, and exposure to sea-level rise.
   From the array of management actions available, tailored solutions are
   being implemented according to the morphology and location of the areas.
   Concerted action by international, government, and local partners is
   required for successful protection of the areas, including
   implementation of adaptive plans and monitoring progress schemes.},

   recovered. Complex phenomena occur during primary coalbed methane (CBM)
   recovery and CO2 injection for enhanced methane production and CO2
   sequestration (CO2-ECBM). Numerical modeling and simulations can be used
   to represent these complex phenomena.
   This research investigates the CO2 storage capacity and CO2-ECBM
   recovery potential of a high volatile bituminous coal (Ferron coal) in
   Buzzard Bench, Uinta Basin. It is one of the most recognized coalbed
   methane producing areas in the U.S. and high-graded for evaluation due
   to its proximity to coal-fired power plants and CBM activity history. A
   three-dimensional geological model was first constructed with
   information available from the public domain. Available gamma-ray and
   density logs were utilized to develop the three-dimensional model of the
   coal seam and the overlying rocks using geostatistical techniques. This
   allows heterogeneity to be introduced in both vertical and horizontal
   directions, thereby creating a representational geologic model. After
   that, a dynamic reservoir model was constructed and calibrated against
   actual methane production using a history match. Simulations of CO2
   injection and collateral methane production were carried out after the
   history match using two injectors and two production wells.
   The fluid flow simulation results demonstrated that it may be feasible
   to inject 1.16 million tons and sequester 1.15 million tons of CO2 over
   20 years. Additionally, 13.95 billion cubic feet of methane were
   recovered within the same period. Due to the permeability reduction by
   coal matrix swelling, the methane recovered decreased by 19\%, while the
   volume of CO2 injected decreased by 29\%. This demonstrated injection
   feasibility, even in the presence of potential permeability reduction by
   coal matrix swelling during CO2 injection. Injection and production
   strategies are suggested to maximize injectivity and sequestration to
   overcome problems resulting from permeability changes and override.},

Abstract = {The science of climate change is now well established. Predicted
   weather-related events like sea level rise, increased storm events, and
   extreme heat waves imply an urgent need for new approaches to settlement
   design to enable human and non-human species to adapt to these increased
   risks. A wide variety of policy responses are emerging at local and
   regional levels - from sustainable urban form, to alternative energy
   production and new approaches to biodiversity conservation. However.
   little attempt has been made to ensure that strategies to adapt to the
   inevitable impacts of enhanced climate change (such as additional open
   space to enable water inundation) support ongoing policies intended to
   mitigate local contributions to climate change (such as attempts to
   increase urban densities to reduce car dependency). In some cases
   mitigation and adaptation are complementary but in other cases these
   policy goals may conflict. This research examined leading case examples
   of land-use plans and policies designed to address climate change.
   Focusing predominantly on cases from the United States and Australia, we
   identified whether the policies address adaptation, mitigation or both
   and whether the practices put mitigation and adaptation in potential
   conflict with each other. We found that half of the actions identified
   contain potential conflicts to achieving adaptation and mitigation
   simultaneously. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {New cool concrete for building envelopes and urban paving: Optics-energy
   and thermal assessment in dynamic conditions},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is an acknowledged effect that causes higher
   temperatures in urban areas compared to the surrounding rural areas.
   Such urban overheating directly increases buildings' energy demand for
   cooling, to reach thermal comfort conditions in the indoor areas. This
   phenomenon increases energy consumption and, consequently, greenhouse
   gas emissions in the cooling season. Moreover, it seriously threatens
   citizens' environmental comfort in urban areas. In this context, the use
   of cool (high solar reflectance and thermal emittance) materials has
   been widely acknowledged as a promising passive UHI mitigation solution.
   However, the application of such cool materials does not comply with the
   environmental preservation of cultural heritage sites, for architectural
   reasons. In fact, historical districts, which constitute a large part of
   European building stock, are often characterized by non-cool, dark
   colored materials. Therefore, the most common, light-colored cool
   solutions cannot be applied, since regulations on such protected areas
   are strict. Indeed, the above-mentioned regulations do not allow the
   modification of visible parts of the building. In this paper, innovative
   concrete elements with infrared-reflective (IR) pigments are presented
   to be used as i) urban paving, ii) building facade elements, and iii)
   retrofit strategies for walls and pavements in historical buildings.
   Both in-lab and in-field characterization of the samples are carried out
   with dynamically varying thermal and radiative forcing. Results indicate
   that prototypes with IR pigments have higher solar reflectance, up to
   +15.8\% compared to standard concrete prototypes and +12.5\% with
   respect to same color prototypes without high infrared reflective
   pigments. Moreover, they are able to maintain surface temperatures that
   are up to -10.6 degrees C lower with respect to non-IR samples. These
   results confirm that the presented composite material represents a good
   solution for passive cooling at building and inter-building scale. (C)

Title = {How Feasible Is the Scaling-Out of Livelihood and Food System Adaptation
   in Asia-Pacific Islands?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {The sustainable development and food security of islands in the
   Asia-Pacific region is severely compromised by climate change, sea level
   rise and compounding socio-economic issues. To achieve a step-change in
   food production and climate adaptation, livelihoods must rapidly
   transform. Food security programs continue to apply the ``pipeline{''}
   model of scaling-out technological innovations, but do not account for
   the social-ecological complexity of islands. We tested the feasibility
   of scaling-out adaptation strategies in two provinces in the region:
   Nusa Tenggara Barat in Indonesia, and West New Britain in Papua New
   Guinea. Guided by a sub-district typology of resource use, we trialled a
   participatory, systems-based livelihood adaptation pathways approach in
   sub-district case studies. The process aimed to mainstream social
   learning and future uncertainty into community development
   decision-making, yielding `no regrets' adaptation strategies to
   transform livelihoods. We tested two assumptions: first, that because
   the contexts of all villages were homogenous, strategies were
   sufficiently similar to enable scaling-out across the provinces; second,
   that the sub-district typologies would assist scaling-out within each
   type. The results showed that the first assumption was untenable: there
   was very little similarity amongst villages' strategies; only
   sustainable fisheries management was scalable amongst coastal villages.
   The second was marginally tenable, because there were strong
   similarities amongst villages in an off-shore island type. When pooled
   into classes of adaptation strategy, most related to practice and
   behaviour change, and addressed systemic social issues; very few were
   technological. Our results suggest that scaling-out livelihood and food
   system innovations is not feasible due to the complex social-ecological
   contexts within islands, caused by steep climate gradients, natural
   resource and cultural diversity. We discuss the limitations of a
   resource use typology that aimed to mitigate this complexity and guide
   scaling-out. Instead we argue that appropriate social learning
   approaches akin to livelihood adaptation pathways must be mainstreamed
   into existing community development decision cycles, thereby
   ``scaling-up{''} and ``scaling-deep{''} to tackle institutional,
   political and cultural barriers to transformation. We discuss the
   implications of our recommendations for government and donor support for
   food security programs in islands of the Asia-Pacific region, and future
   research priorities.},

Title = {Internal relocation as a relevant and feasible adaptation strategy in
   Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Atoll islands face increasing coastal risks (coastal erosion and marine
   flooding) due to climate change, especially sea-level rise. To face
   increasing coastal risks, various adaptation options are considered by
   atoll countries and territories, including in particular hard protection
   (preferred option to date), Nature-based Solutions (increasingly used)
   and island raising (considered a longer-term solution and a potential
   alternative to international migration, e.g. in the Maldives). Internal
   relocation within the same atoll island or atoll, which refers to
   long-term community movement from one threatened island area or island
   to a safer island area or island, has previously been disregarded by
   scholars as a potentially relevant climate adaptation strategy. However,
   in low-lying coastal areas, it offers real potential to address the dual
   context of increasing climate risks and the shrinking of the solution
   space. This paper assesses the potential of internal relocation for
   atolls by applying to Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia, Central Pacific,
   a two-fold assessment framework questioning its physical relevance (are
   some islands high enough to host settlements in the future?) and its
   societal feasibility (are the political-institutional and socio-economic
   conditions in place? Are people willing to relocate?). The findings show
   that internal relocation is both relevant and feasible on Rangiroa Atoll
   and should therefore serve as a pillar to develop robust in situ
   adaptation pathways in this atoll.},

Title = {Grassland farmers' attitudes toward climate change in the North German
   Plain},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts will affect grassland farming in various ways in
   the future. Communication and knowledge transfer are crucial to
   implement on-farm adaptation measures required to meet these challenges
   in a timely way. Therefore, we need to know how grassland farmers
   perceive climate change and which factors influence their attitude. We
   hypothesized that besides direct factors such as region, farm size, age
   and education, farmers' socio-cultural background and their beliefs and
   attitudes are most important in their reaction to climate change. To
   investigate this, we conducted a survey with extensive on-farm
   interviews (n = 82) in four distinctive regions in the North German
   Plain on a gradient from sub-maritime to areas with sub-continental
   climate. We found that with a more continental climate and less rainfall
   and with increasing farm size, grassland farmers were more aware of the
   implications of climate change. In a second step, to categorize the
   influence of personal beliefs on decisions concerning farming, we
   applied the typology approach and distinguished four farming styles.
   Farmers in the four groups differed in terms of climate change awareness
   and adaptation preferences (P < 0.05). Yield Optimizers and Modernists

Title = {Green Infrastructure as an Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategy-A
   Review},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research on urban heat mitigation has been growing in recent years with
   many of the studies focusing on green infrastructure (GI) as a strategy
   to mitigate the adverse effects of an urban heat island (UHI). This
   paper aims at presenting a review of the range of findings from GI
   research for urban heat mitigation through a review of scientific
   articles published during the years 2009-2020. This research includes a
   review of the different types of GI and its contribution for urban heat
   mitigation and human thermal comfort. In addition to analysing different
   mitigation strategies, numerical simulation tools that are commonly used
   are also reviewed. It is seen that ENVI-met is one of the modelling
   tools that is considered as a reliable to simulate different mitigation
   strategies and hence has been widely used in the recent past.
   Considering its popularity in urban microclimate studies, this article
   also provides a review of ENVI-met simulation results that were reported
   in the reviewed papers. It was observed that the majority of the
   research was conducted on a limited spatial scale and focused on
   temperature and human thermal comfort.},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Low-lying, densely populated coastal areas worldwide are under threat,
   requiring coastal managers to develop new strategies to cope with land
   subsidence, sea-level rise and the increasing risk of
   storm-surge-induced floods. Traditional engineering approaches
   optimizing for safety are often suboptimal with respect to other
   functions and are neither resilient nor sustainable. Densely populated
   deltas in particular need more resilient solutions that are robust,
   sustainable, adaptable, multifunctional and yet economically feasible.
   Innovative concepts such as `Building with Nature' provide a basis for
   coastal protection strategies that are able to follow gradual changes in
   climate and other environmental conditions, while maintaining flood
   safety, ecological values and socio-economic functions. This paper
   presents a conceptual framework for Building with Nature that is used to
   evaluate coastal protection strategies, based on a case study of the
   Holland coast in the Netherlands. The added value and the limitations of
   these strategies are discussed.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},

Volume = {30},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the Anthropocene, marine ecosystems are rapidly shifting to new
   ecological states. Achieving effective conservation of marine
   biodiversity has become a fast-moving target because of both global
   climate change and continuous shifts in marine policies. How prepared
   are we to deal with this crisis? We examined EU Member States Programs
   of Measures designed for the implementation of EU marine environmental
   policies, as well as recent European Marine Spatial Plans, and
   discovered that climate change is rarely considered operationally.
   Further, our analysis revealed that monitoring programs in marine
   protected areas are often insufficient to clearly distinguish between
   impacts of local and global stressors. Finally, we suggest that while
   the novel global Blue Growth approach may jeopardize previous marine
   conservation efforts, it can also provide new conservation
   opportunities. Adaptive management is the way forward (e.g., preserving
   ecosystem functions in climate change hotspots, and identifying and
   targeting climate refugia areas for protection) using Marine Spatial
   Planning as a framework for action, especially given the push for Blue
   Growth.},

Abstract = {Coastal tourism is a vital part of the world economy bit also
   facilitates access to ?blue spaces? ? this offers significant health
   benefits to populations and shapes our relationship with the coast. At
   present, climate change impacts on the coast, such as storm surges and
   rising sea levels, are an inevitability and, in some regions, they are
   already damaging coastal tourism economies. It is clear, therefore, that
   our relationship with the coast will change. Given the importance of
   coastal tourism, this new relationship needs to incorporate adaptive
   measures; including a blue space and wellbeing focus, education and
   awareness of challenges facing the natural environment. We make this
   case by re-evaluating the literature on coastal tourism and climate
   adaptation policies. Using recent examples, we also offer an indication
   of new policy directions for coastal destinations. At present coastal
   tourism plans and policies largely ignore how destinations might respond
   and adapt to climate change impacts. We critique this and suggest that
   the human?environment relationship should be placed directly at the
   centre of all thinking on this topic.},

Pages = {576-596},
Abstract = {Ports are important nodes in maritime transportation networks. However,
   port managers face different types of risks in port operations which may
   disrupt cargo flows in the logistics chain. These risk factors are
   expected to increase in view of such global issues as climate change and
   geopolitical changes. An overview of risk classifications and mitigation
   strategies in port logistics can help academics and practitioners
   prepare for managing port logistics risks. Consequently, this paper
   presents a conceptual discussion of port logistics risks and illustrates
   an exemplary define-measure-analyse-improve-control (DMAIC)
   implementation framework to highlight potential risk management and
   mitigation strategies in port operations. Our discussion advances
   knowledge on the different risk factors with a practical step-by-step
   approach for addressing the risk in port logistics.},

   policy response is considered. The main results are as follows. (1)
   Marine economic efficiency dominates the synergistic development of the
   system; however, the effect of resilience becomes increasingly prominent
   as the quality of China's marine economy increases. (2) A significant
   spatio-temporal difference is observed in the synergistic evolution of
   marine economic resilience and efficiency. Moreover, a pattern of
   polarization still exists, inter-regional cooperation is insufficient,
   and the resilience-efficiency relationship tends to evolve from the
   primary to advanced stage and from single polarization to
   multi-polarization. (3) The dynamic effects of marine economic
   resilience and efficiency exhibit fluctuating characteristics, which
   indicates that endogenous growth of China's marine economy is
   insufficient. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a diversified
   industrial system under the existing industrial foundation and
   technological level to strengthen economic resilience and promote
   sustainable development of the marine economy. (4) A policy response
   mechanism should be constructed that focuses on resilience policy and
   explores policy interactions from the three aspects of the marine
   industry, marine cultural environment, and marine governance. Such a
   policy framework would provide theoretical and practical support for
   building marine economic resilience.},

Abstract = {Climate action at the local level represents an important and unique
   complement to global and national-level policies. This study provides
   one of the first systematic analyses of local climate actions in the
   State of California by comparing cities' adoption of alternative
   policies and statistical modeling of local choices of climate actions.
   The pattern of adopting different climate actions incrementally suggests
   that cities prefer certain actions than others. Coastal location,
   instead of the usual predictors of local mitigation actions, is found to
   affect cities' adaptation actions. Whether a city is more likely to keep
   its commitment to mitigate climate change depends on the nature of the
   commitment.},

Title = {Vulnerability assessment of urban community and critical infrastructures
   for integrated flood risk management and climate adaptation strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {375-411},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to develop an integrated
   framework for assessing the flood risk and climate adaptation capacity
   of an urban area and its critical infrastructures to help address flood
   risk management issues and identify climate adaptation strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using the January 2011 flood in the core
   suburbs of Brisbane City, Queensland, Australia, various spatial
   analytical tools (i.e. digital elevation modeling and urban
   morphological characterization with 3D analysis, spatial analysis with
   fuzzy logic, proximity analysis, line statistics, quadrat analysis,
   collect events analysis, spatial autocorrelation techniques with global
   Moran's I and local Moran's I, inverse distance weight method, and hot
   spot analysis) were implemented to transform and standardize hazard,
   vulnerability, and exposure indicating variables. The issue on the
   sufficiency of indicating variables was addressed using the topological
   cluster analysis of a two-dimension self-organizing neural network
   (SONN) structured with 100 neurons and trained by 200 epochs.
   Furthermore, the suitability of flood risk modeling was addressed by
   aggregating the indicating variables with weighted overlay and modified
   fuzzy gamma overlay operations using the Bayesian joint conditional
   probability weights. Variable weights were assigned to address the
   limitations of normative (equal weights) and deductive (expert judgment)
   approaches. Applying geographic information system (GIS) and appropriate
   equations, the flood risk and climate adaptation capacity indices of the
   study area were calculated and corresponding maps were generated.
   Findings - The analyses showed that on the average, 36 (approximately
   813 ha) and 14 per cent (approximately 316 ha) of the study area were
   exposed to very high flood risk and low adaptation capacity,
   respectively. In total, 93 per cent of the study area revealed negative
   adaptation capacity metrics (i.e. minimum of -23 to <0), which implies
   that the socio-economic resources in the area are not enough to increase
   climate resilience of the urban community (i.e. Brisbane City) and its
   critical infrastructures.
   Research limitations/implications - While the framework in this study
   was obtained through a robust approach, the following are the research
   limitations and recommended for further examination: analyzing and
   incorporating the impacts of economic growth; population growth;
   technological advancement; climate and environmental disturbances; and
   climate change; and applying the framework in assessing the risks to
   natural environments such as in agricultural areas, forest protection
   and production areas, biodiversity conservation areas, natural heritage
   sites, watersheds or river basins, parks and recreation areas, coastal
   regions, etc.
   Practical implications - This study provides a tool for high level
   analyses and identifies adaptation strategies to enable urban
   communities and critical infrastructure industries to better prepare and
   mitigate future flood events. The disaster risk reduction measures and
   climate adaptation strategies to increase urban community and critical
   infrastructure resilience were identified in this study. These include
   mitigation on areas of low flood risk or very high climate adaptation
   capacity; mitigation to preparedness on areas of moderate flood risk and
   high climate adaptation capacity; mitigation to response on areas of
   high flood risk and moderate climate adaptation capacity; and mitigation
   to recovery on areas of very high flood risk and low climate adaptation
   capacity. The implications of integrating disaster risk reduction and
   climate adaptation strategies were further examined.
   Originality/value - The newly developed spatially explicit analytical
   technique, identified in this study as the Flood Risk-Adaptation
   Capacity Index-Adaptation Strategies (FRACIAS) Linkage/Integrated Model,
   allows the integration of flood risk and climate adaptation assessments
   which had been treated separately in the past. By applying the FRACIAS
   linkage/integrated model in the context of flood risk and climate
   adaptation capacity assessments, the authors established a framework for
   enhancing measures and adaptation strategies to increase urban community
   and critical infrastructure resilience to flood risk and climate-related
   events.},

Title = {Risks to biodiversity from temperature overshoot pathways},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {377},
Number = {1857},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Temperature overshoot pathways entail exceeding a specified global
   warming level (e.g. 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C) followed by a decline
   in warming, achieved through anthropogenically enhanced CO2 removal from
   the atmosphere. However, risks to biodiversity from temperature
   overshoot pathways are poorly described. Here, we explore biodiversity
   risks from overshoot by synthesizing existing knowledge and quantifying
   the dynamics of exposure and de-exposure to potentially dangerous
   temperatures for more than 30 000 species for a 2 degrees C overshoot
   scenario. Our results suggest that climate risk to biodiversity from
   temperature overshoot pathways will arrive suddenly, but decrease only
   gradually. Peak exposure for biodiversity occurs around the same time as
   peak global warming, but the rate of de-exposure lags behind the
   temperature decline. While the global overshoot period lasts around 60
   years, the duration of elevated exposure of marine and terrestrial
   biodiversity is substantially longer (around 100 and 130 years,
   respectively), with some ecological communities never returning to
   pre-overshoot exposure levels. Key biodiversity impacts may be
   irreversible and reliance on widespread CO2 removal to reduce warming
   poses additional risks to biodiversity through altered land use.
   Avoiding any temperature overshoot must be a priority for reducing
   biodiversity risks from climate change, followed by limiting the
   magnitude and duration of any overshoot. More integrated models that
   include direct and indirect impacts from overshoot are needed to inform
   policy.This article is part of the theme issue `Ecological complexity
   and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.},

Title = {How to tackle complexity in urban climate resilience? Negotiating
   climate science, adaptation and multi-level governance in India},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {As the world's population is expected to be over 2/3(rd) urban by 2050,
   climate action in cities is a growing area of interest in the
   inter-disciplines of development policy, disaster mitigation and
   environmental governance. The climate impacts are expected to be quite
   severe in the developing world, given its urban societies are densely
   packed, vastly exposed to natural elements while possessing limited
   capabilities. There is a notable ambiguity and complexity that inhibits
   a methodical approach in identifying urban resilience measures. The
   complexity is due to intersection of large number of distinct variables
   in climate geoscience (precipitation and temperature anomalies at
   different locations, RCPs, timeline), adaptation alternatives (approach,
   priority, intervention level) and urban governance (functional mandate,
   institutional capacity, and plans \& policies). This research examines
   how disparate and complex knowledge and information in these
   inter-disciplines can be processed for systematic `negotiation' to
   situate, ground and operationalize resilience in cities. With India as a
   case, we test this by simulating mid-term and long-run climate scenarios
   (2050 \& 2080) to map regional climate impacts that shows escalation in
   the intensity of climate events like heat waves, urban flooding,
   landslides and sea level rise. We draw on suitable adaptation measures
   for five key urban sectors- water, infrastructure (including energy),
   building, urban planning, health and conclude a sleuth of climate
   resilience building measures for policy application through national/
   state policies, local urban plans and preparation of city resilience
   strategy, as well as advance the research on `negotiated resilience' in
   urban areas},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Faced with sea level rise and the intensification of extreme events,
   human populations living on the coasts are developing responses to
   address local situations. A synthesis of the literature on responses to
   coastal adaptation allows us to highlight different adaptation
   strategies. Here, we analyze these strategies according to the
   complexity of their implementation, both institutionally and
   technically. First, we distinguish two opposing paradigms - fighting
   against rising sea levels or adapting to new climatic conditions; and
   second, we observe the level of integrated management of the strategies.
   This typology allows a distinction between four archetypes with the most
   commonly associated governance modalities for each. We then underline
   the need for hybrid approaches and adaptation trajectories over time to
   take into account local socio-cultural, geographical, and climatic
   conditions as well as to integrate stakeholders in the design and
   implementation of responses. We show that dynamic and participatory
   policies can foster collective learning processes and enable the
   evolution of social values and behaviors. Finally, adaptation policies
   rely on knowledge and participatory engagement, multi-scalar governance,
   policy monitoring, and territorial solidarity. These conditions are
   especially relevant for densely populated areas that will be confronted
   with sea level rise, thus for coastal cities in particular.},

Title = {Applying Analytic Hierarchy Process to Adaptation to Saltwater Intrusion
   in Vietnam},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Given the multidimensional nature of climate change issues,
   decision-making in climate change adaptation is a complex process, and
   suitable decision support methods are needed. The aim of this paper was
   to rank saltwater intrusion adaptation options for farmers in two
   provinces in the central coastal region of Vietnam using the analytical
   hierarchy process method. Data for the analysis were obtained through a
   literature review, field observations, and face-to-face interviews and
   focus group discussions with key informants. We combined two ways of
   weighting to arrive at final scores for each of the identified
   adaptation options: prioritizing criteria and subcriteria by pairwise
   comparison and rating the different alternatives with respect to the
   lowest level subcriteria. In doing so, we also investigated differences
   in the priority sets and final rankings of the analytical hierarchy
   process applications in both provinces. In our study, we worked with
   group consensus scores on both the criteria weights and the ratings for
   the different adaptation options for each of the criteria. Our results
   revealed that ``sustainability and equity{''} was the most important
   criteria, while coherence ranked lowest. The final ranking of adaptation
   options differed between both provinces due to differences in the
   geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the study areas. The
   consistency ratios for all pairwise matrices were less than 0.1,
   indicating that judgments from the focus group discussions with respect
   to the different criteria were highly consistent. A sensitivity analysis
   of our results confirmed the robustness of the rankings in our research.},

Abstract = {Salinity intrusion in soil caused by climate-induced hazards, especially
   cyclones and sea level rise (SLR), is adversely affecting rice
   production in coastal Bangladesh. The southwest coastal district of
   Satkhira is one of the most vulnerable areas because of its high
   exposure to salinity intrusion and widespread poverty. Based on a survey
   of 360 farming households in four villages and on focus group
   discussions, in-depth interviews and community consultations, this paper
   explores how salinity intrusion affects rice production. This research
   demonstrates that salinity levels in the soil have increased sharply
   over the last 20 years. The introduction of saline-tolerant rice
   cultivars has been the most important adaptation measure being
   practised. These adaptation measures, however, have not been enough to
   deal with the sudden increase in salinity after cyclone Aila hit the
   area in 2009, with devastating consequences. In that year, farmers in
   the study areas lost their entire potential yield of aman rice
   production.},

Abstract = {In the past efforts to prevent catastrophic losses from natural hazards
   have largely been undertaken by individual property owners based on
   site-specific evaluations of risks to particular buildings. Public
   efforts to assess community vulnerability and encourage mitigation have
   focused on either aggregating site-specific estimates or adopting
   standards based upon broad assumptions about regional risks. This paper
   develops an alternative, intermediate-scale approach to regional risk
   assessment and the evaluation of community mitigation policies.
   Properties are grouped into types with similar land uses and levels of
   hazard, and hypothetical community mitigation strategies for protecting
   these. properties are modeled like investment portfolios. The portfolios
   consist of investments in mitigation against the risk to a community
   posed by a specific natural hazard and are defined by a community's
   mitigation budget and the proportion of the budget invested in
   locations, of each type.
   The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated through an integrated
   assessment of earthquake-induced lateral-spread ground failure risk in
   the Watsonville, California area. Data from the magnitude 6.9 Loma
   Prieta earthquake of 1989 are used to model lateral-spread ground
   failure susceptibility. Earth science and economic data are combined and
   analyzed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The portfolio model
   is then used to evaluate the benefits of mitigating the risk in
   different locations. Two mitigation policies one that prioritizes
   mitigation by land use type and the other by hazard zone, are. compared
   with a status quo policy of doing no further mitigation beyond that
   which already exists. The portfolio representing the hazard zone role
   yields a higher expected return than the land use portfolio does;
   however. the hazard zone portfolio experiences a higher standard
   deviation. Therefore, neither portfolio is clearly preferred. The two
   mitigation policies both reduce expected losses and increase overall
   expected community wealth compared to the status quo policy.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In response to increasing emphasis on adapting to climate change,
   various stakeholders have focused on building adaptive capacity and
   `mainstreaming' adaptation policies, although the tools to achieve these
   goals are still developing. Using Metro Vancouver as a case study, this
   paper outlines how a system dynamics (SD) approach was used to develop a
   conceptual model of social vulnerability and resilience in order to
   simulate the impact of potential adaptation polices. The SD approach was
   particularly effective for: modelling the underlying constructs and
   feedbacks related to vulnerability; linking vulnerability and resilience
   concepts; and integrating the responses and actions taken at various
   scales. Challenges included modelling the relationship between
   vulnerability and resilience, and establishing causal linkages and
   directional relationships between feedbacks. The model demonstrates the
   potential for SD tools to help stakeholders bridge the gap between
   theory and on-the-ground decision-making by providing insight into the
   potential effectiveness of proposed adaptation interventions.},

Journal = {ERDE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {144},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {181-201},
Abstract = {In the near-surface atmosphere, heat waves during the summer cause
   situations that may lead to human-biometeorological impairment. Because
   of their high population density, overheated cities are particularly
   strongly affected by heat stress. In the future, due to the effects of
   climate change, heat stress will increase in terms of its intensity and
   spatial expansion in the areas of concern. Taking the example of the
   city of Gelsenkirchen, Germany, this article presents a method for the
   identification of areas requiring adaptation or protection. A scenario
   of the future increase of heat stress events is presented, based on data
   of the German climate change model STAR II. For the identification of
   areas requiring adaptation and protection, spatial analyses of the urban
   heat island, land use and demographic aspects were performed using GIS
   tools. The application and assessment of adaptation measures is
   investigated for an urban quarter using the microscale numerical model
   ENVI-met. Finally adaptation measures in urban planning against heat
   stress are discussed. The relevant urban planning adaptation measures,
   which are also important in view of climate change, not only involve
   heat stress reduction in the residential areas already affected, but
   also involve the protection and optimisation of existing favourable and
   compensation areas.},

   Adaptive management pathways under dynamic risk},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {206-215},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Government seeks to manage public protected areas, such as national
   parks, to conserve high-quality wildlife habitats and provide essential
   ecosystems services at risk of permanent damage or extinction from
   climate change. The complexity of the organizational structure required
   to deliver this breadth of functions, coupled to uncertainty surrounding
   the onset and severity of climate impacts at local scale, impedes
   planning for climate change. This paper describes the development of an
   adaptation planning tool and its application in a pilot planning process
   for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the agency of the New South
   Wales (NSW) Government (Australia) responsible for management of
   national parks and public conservation reserves. The process involved
   close engagement in knowledge co-production in participatory workshops,
   and employed two complementary techniques, adaptive pathways and risk
   assessment. It successfully elicited tacit knowledge of agency staff
   about the range of interventions available, the need for management
   practices to evolve, and of discontinuities in management pathways in a
   dynamic risk environment. Findings suggest that management effort across
   the NSW reserve system will increase as climate risk rises.
   Consequently, government will need to respond to increased demand for
   resources, for better targeting of those resources, and for management
   innovation in how resources are deployed to support adaptation that is
   both anticipatory and transformative.},

Abstract = {Low-lying, densely populated coastal areas worldwide are under threat,
   requiring coastal managers to develop new strategies to cope with land
   subsidence, sea-level rise and the increasing risk of
   storm-surge-induced floods. Traditional engineering approaches
   optimizing for safety are often suboptimal with respect to other
   functions and are neither resilient nor sustainable. Densely populated
   deltas in particular need more resilient solutions that are robust,
   sustainable, adaptable, multifunctional and yet economically feasible.
   Innovative concepts such as `Building with Nature' provide a basis for
   coastal protection strategies that are able to follow gradual changes in
   climate and other environmental conditions, while maintaining flood
   safety, ecological values and socio-economic functions. This paper
   presents a conceptual framework for Building with Nature that is used to
   evaluate coastal protection strategies, based on a case study of the
   Holland coast in the Netherlands. The added value and the limitations of
   these strategies are discussed.},

Title = {Simulating Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics with Residue Removal Using the

Abstract = {Concerns about CO(2) emissions and fossil fuel supplies have enhanced
   interest in using crop residues for biofuel production; however,
   maintaining soil organic C (SOC) through residue return is vital for
   maintaining sod productivity. Our objectives were to simulate long-term
   SOC dynamics using CQESTR and to examine the effect of residue harvest
   on SOC stocks under disking (DT) and conservation tillage (CS). A
   long-term study in the mid-Coastal Plain region of South Carolina was
   used to simulate four residue harvest rates (0, 50,66, and 90\%) during
   two harvest periods. The yearly variation of SOC was predicted well
   (r(2) = 0.84, P < 0.0001). Without residue removal, average increases of
   0.10 and 0.39 g SOC kg(-1) yr(-1) were predicted under DT and CS,
   respectively, consistent with observed increases of 0.12 and 0.44 g SOC
   kg(-1) yr(-1). After 23 yr, simulated SOC stock gain was more than
   threefold greater under CS than DT (9.0 vs. 2.4 g SOC kg(-1)). The model
   predicted 1.86 and 4.47 g SOC kg(-1) losses in the top 5 cm of soil
   under DT and CS, respectively, during 23 yr of 66\% residue harvest
   compared with no residue harvest. The predicted SOC stocks under CS were
   similar to 5 g SOC kg(-1) greater than under DT, however, even with 90\%
   residue harvest. The quantities of crop residue that can be sustainably
   harvested were directly influenced by the initial SOC concentration and
   tillage practices. While CS can somewhat mitigate the loss of soil C,
   residue harvest from loamy sand soils may have an adverse impact on SOC
   stocks.},

Abstract = {The global response to the challenge of increasingly rapid and severe
   climate change is shifting from a focus on mitigation and remediation of
   impacts to a pragmatic adaptation framework. Innovative adaptive
   solutions that transform the way in which we manage the world's oceans
   and, particularly, the harvesting of marine resources in a sustainable
   manner, are urgently needed. In that context, ICES Journal of Marine
   Science solicited contributions to the themed article set (TS),
   ``Exploring adaptation capacity of the world's oceans and marine
   resources to climate change{''}. We summarize the contributions included
   in this TS that provide examples of emerging climate change impacts,
   assess system risks at subnational and international scales, prove and
   evaluate different adaptation options and approaches, and explore
   societal and stakeholder perceptions. We also provide some ``food for
   thought{''} on possible future developments in a transdisciplinary
   ``adaptation science{''} working at the interface between ecology,
   socio-economics, and policy-governance, and that will have to provide
   concrete solutions to the challenges represented by climate-change and
   anthropogenic activity. Success will depend on the extent to which new
   knowledge and approaches can be integrated into the decision-making
   process to support evidence-based climate policy and ecosystem-based
   management. This includes testing their effectiveness in real systems,
   but also consider how social acceptance of adaptive measures will/will
   not support their full implementation.},

Title = {An integrated approach for physical, economic, and demographic
   evaluation of coastal flood hazard adaptation in Santa Monica Bay,
   California},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The increased risk of coastal flooding associated with climate-change
   driven sea level rise threatens to displace communities and cause
   substantial damage to infrastructure. Site-specific adaptation planning
   is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of flooding on coastal
   residents and the built environment. Cost-benefit analyses used to
   evaluate coastal adaption strategies have traditionally focused on
   economic considerations, often overlooking potential demographic impacts
   that can directly influence vulnerability in coastal communities. Here,
   we present a transferable framework that couples hydrodynamic modeling
   of flooding driven by sea level rise and storm scenarios with
   site-specific building stock and census block-level demographic data. We
   assess the efficacy of multiple coastal adaptation strategies at
   reducing flooding, economic damages, and impacts to the local
   population. We apply this framework to evaluate a range of engineered,
   nature-based, and hybrid adaptation strategies for a portion of Santa
   Monica Bay, California. Overall, we find that dual approaches that
   provide protection along beaches using dunes or seawalls and along
   inlets using sluice gates perform best at reducing or eliminating
   flooding, damages, and population impacts. Adaptation strategies that
   include a sluice gate and partial or no protection along the beach are
   effective at reducing flooding around inlets but can exacerbate flooding
   elsewhere, leading to unintended impacts on residents. Our results also
   indicate trade-offs between economic and social risk-reduction
   priorities. The proposed framework allows for a comprehensive evaluation
   of coastal protection strategies across multiple objectives.
   Understanding how coastal adaptation strategies affect hydrodynamic,
   economic, and social factors at a local scale can enable more effective
   and equitable planning approaches.},

Title = {Long Term Sugarcane Crop Residue Retention Offers Limited Potential to
   Reduce Nitrogen Fertilizer Rates in Australian Wet Tropical Environments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {The warming of world climate systems is driving interest in the
   mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the agricultural
   sector, practices that mitigate GHG emissions include those that (1)
   reduce emissions {[}e.g., those that reduce nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions by avoiding excess nitrogen (N) fertilizer application], and
   (2) increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (e.g., by retaining
   instead of burning crop residues). Sugarcane is a globally important
   crop that can have substantial inputs of N fertilizer and which produces
   large amounts of crop residues ('trash'). Management of N fertilizer and
   trash affects soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and hence GHG emissions.
   Trash has historically been burned at harvest, but increasingly is being
   retained on the soil surface as a `trash blanket' in many countries. The
   potential for trash retention to alter N fertilizer requirements and
   sequester SOC was investigated in this study. The APSIM model was
   calibrated with data from field and laboratory studies of trash
   decomposition in the wet tropics of northern Australia. APSIM was then
   validated against four independent data sets, before simulating location
   x soil x fertilizer x trash management scenarios. Soil carbon increased
   in trash blanketed soils relative to SOC in soils with burnt trash.
   However, further increases in SOC for the study region may be limited
   because the SOC in trash blanketed soils could be approaching
   equilibrium; future GHG mitigation efforts in this region should
   therefore focus on N fertilizer management. Simulated N fertilizer rates
   were able to be reduced from conventional rates regardless of trash
   management, because of low yield potential in the wet tropics. For crops
   subjected to continuous trash blanketing, there was substantial
   immobilization of N in decomposing trash so conventional N fertilizer
   rates were required for up to 24 years after trash blanketing commenced.
   After this period, there was potential to reduce N fertilizer rates for
   crops when trash was retained (<= 20 kg N ha(-1)per plant or ratoon
   crop) while maintaining >= 95\% of maximum yields. While these savings
   in N fertilizer use were modest at the field scale, they were
   potentially important when aggregated at the regional level.},

Title = {Optimum Design of Hybrid Renewable Energy System for Sustainable Energy
   Supply to a Remote Island},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Renewable energy technologies can not only help in mitigating the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but it can also be very useful for
   electricity generation at remote locations, where no other means of
   power are available. The present study focuses on the techno-economic
   optimum design of a small hybrid renewable energy system (HRES)
   consisting of wind-solar as primary energy sources. The HRES was
   modelled for a remote island (Deokjeok-do Island, South Korea) using
   real electricity consumption data for one complete year. A daily mean
   load of 24,720 kWh was entered at Deokjeok-do Island with a peak load of
   2291.54 kW. Average annual values of wind speed and daily solar
   radiations were estimated to be 3.6 m/s (10 m height) and 4.13 kWh/m(2),
   respectively. A total of 8760 simulations were performed to achieve the
   hourly load demand of the mentioned island. In order to deal with the
   surplus and electricity deficit, two different types of energy storage
   systems (ESS) were modelled i.e., battery and pumped hydro storage
   (PHS). Four different HRESs were also evaluated as the most suitable
   based on levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and net present cost (NPC). A
   detailed economic break-down of each component and the impact of
   different sensitivity variables on decision making have also been
   discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA),
   commonly referred to as `The Breaux Act', has provided some of the
   resources necessary to begin implementing a comprehensive, large-scale,
   long-term coastal wetland restoration program for Louisiana USA. Due to
   the dynamic nature of this ecosystem and the uncertainty associated with
   large-scale restoration, adaptive management principles were embedded
   throughout CWPPRA's organizational structure, planning process, project
   implementation, and monitoring program to facilitate achieving the
   mandates associated with the Breaux Act. Feedback loops were established
   within and between each of the programmatic components to encourage
   continuous learning, which is central to adaptive management. The
   knowledge gained has led to institutionalized change in projects as well
   as the program. This paper describes how the formation of the CWPPRA
   Task Force and associated committees and groups resulted in an
   integrated coast-wide process for planning, selection, construction,
   operation, maintenance, monitoring, and scientific evaluation of 84
   restoration projects implemented or scheduled for implementation
   throughout coastal Louisiana. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Understanding Perceptions of Climate Change, Priorities, and

   Adaptation and Mitigation Planning},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Climate change poses multiple risks to the population of Lima, the
   largest city and capital of Peru, located on the Pacific coast in a
   desert ecosystem. These risks include increased water scarcity,
   increased heat, and the introduction and emergence of vector-borne and
   other climate sensitive diseases. To respond to these threats, it is
   necessary for the government, at every level, to adopt more mitigation
   and adaptation strategies. Here, focus groups were conducted with
   representatives from five Lima municipalities to determine priorities,
   perception of climate change, and decision-making processes for
   implementing projects within each municipality. These factors can affect
   the ability and desire of a community to implement climate change
   adaptation and mitigation strategies. The results show that climate
   change and other environmental factors are of relatively low priority,
   whereas public safety and water and sanitation services are of highest
   concern. Perhaps most importantly, climate change is not well understood
   among the municipalities. Participants had trouble distinguishing
   climate change from other environmental issues and did not fully
   understand its causes and effects. Greater understanding of what climate
   change is and why it is important is necessary for it to become a
   priority for the municipalities. Different aspects of increased climate
   change awareness seem to be connected to having experienced extreme
   weather events, whether related or not to climate change, and to higher
   socioeconomic status.},

Title = {Structural and Psycho-Social Limits to Climate Change Adaptation in the
   Great Barrier Reef Region},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Adaptation, as a strategy to respond to climate change, has limits:
   there are conditions under which adaptation strategies fail to alleviate
   impacts from climate change. Research has primarily focused on
   identifying absolute bio-physical limits. This paper contributes
   empirical insight to an emerging literature on the social limits to
   adaptation. Such limits arise from the ways in which societies perceive,
   experience and respond to climate change. Using qualitative data from
   multi-stakeholder workshops and key-informant interviews with
   representatives of the fisheries and tourism sectors of the Great
   Barrier Reef region, we identify psycho-social and structural limits
   associated with key adaptation strategies, and examine how these are
   perceived as more or less absolute across levels of organisation. We
   find that actors experience social limits to adaptation when: i) the
   effort of pursuing a strategy exceeds the benefits of desired adaptation
   outcomes; ii) the particular strategy does not address the actual source
   of vulnerability, and; iii) the benefits derived from adaptation are
   undermined by external factors. We also find that social limits are not
   necessarily more absolute at higher levels of organisation: respondents
   perceived considerable opportunities to address some psycho-social
   limits at the national-international interface, while they considered
   some social limits at the local and regional levels to be effectively
   absolute.},

Title = {An Assessment of Vulnerability and Adaptation of Coastal Mangroves of

Booktitle = {THREATS TO MANGROVE FORESTS: HAZARDS, VULNERABILITY, AND MANAGEMENT},
Series = {Coastal Research Library},

Abstract = {This chapter seeks to evaluate the current status of West Africa's
   mangroves. It assesses Climate Change vulnerability and adaptation
   options for mangroves in West Africa. West African mangroves contribute
   a wide range of environmental services, economic goods and social
   services. In spite of the important contributions of mangroves in the
   region, they experiencing high rate of degradation. It is estimated that
   the degradation and the deforestation of mangroves in the region have
   resulted from their uncontrolled anthropogenic exploitation due to
   urbanisation, population growth, salt production, industrial pollution
   and the cutting of mangroves for firewood. Besides the afore-mentioned
   anthropogenic impacts on the mangroves, the anticipated effects of
   climate change such as increased temperatures, sea level rise, increased
   intensity of storm and precipitation are likely to have the most severe
   impacts on mangrove ecosystems. Climate change and the anthropogenic
   driven variations of these environmental forces will inevitably have a
   profound effect on coastal zones and mangroves. The challenge of
   reversing the degradation of mangrove ecosystems in the face of
   uncontrolled exploitation and impacts of climate change seems to be a
   very complex problem. This assessment has identified that both the past
   and the present vulnerability were more controlled by anthropogenic
   activities than the effects of climate change, though it is expected
   that climate change may be the major driving force in the long-term.
   However, many adaptation options exist to enhance specific ecosystem
   services in ways that reduce negative trade-offs, but these involve
   changes in policies, institutional framework and better practices for
   exploitation, and good management strategies. The chapter concludes that
   West Africa should implement adaptation policy options including
   reducing anthropogenic impacts, maintaining coastal buffer zones,
   restoration of mangroves, catchment management, establishing regional
   monitoring and regulations and education and local participation to
   enhance sustainability.},

Title = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane in paddy soil: Role of electron acceptors
   and fertilization in mitigating CH4 fluxes},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {141},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine ecosystems is
   ubiquitous and largely coupled to sulfate reduction. In contrast, the
   role of AOM in terrestrial environments and the dominant electron
   acceptors driving terrestrial AOM needs deeper understanding. Submerged
   rice paddies with intensive CH4 production have a high potential for
   AOM, which can be important for greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.
   Here, we used (CH4)-C-13 to quantify the AOM rates in paddy soils under
   organic (Pig manure, Biochar) and mineral (NPK) fertilization.
   Alternative-to-oxygen electron acceptors for CH4 oxidation, including
   Fe3+, NO3, SO42-, and humic acids, were examined and their potential for
   CH4 mitigation from rice paddies was assessed by (CH4)-C-13 oxidation to
   (CO2)-C-13 under anoxic conditions.
   During 84 days of anaerobic incubation, the cumulative AOM
   (13CH4-derived CO2) reached 0.15-1.3 mu g C g-1 dry soil depending on
   fertilization. NO3- was the most effective electron acceptor, yielding
   an AOM rate of 0.80 ng C g(-1) dry soil h(-1) under Pig manure. The role
   of Fe3+ in AOM remained unclear, whereas SO42- inhibited AOM but
   strongly stimulated the production of unlabeled CO2, indicating
   intensive sulfate-induced decomposition of organic matter. Humic acids
   were the second most effective electron acceptor for AOM, but increased
   methanogenesis by 5-6 times in all fertilization treatments. We
   demonstrated for the first time that organic electron acceptors (humic
   acids) are among the key AOM drivers and are crucial in paddy soils. The
   most pronounced AOM in paddy soils occurred under Pig manure, followed
   by Control and NPK, while AOM was the lowest under Biochar. We estimate
   that nitrate (nitrite)-dependent AOM in paddy fields globally consumes
   similar to 3.9 Tg C-CH4 yr-1, thereby offsetting the global CH4
   emissions by similar to 10-20\%. Thus, from a broader agroecological
   perspective, the organic and mineral fertilizers control an important
   CH4 sink under anaerobic conditions in submerged ecosystems. Appropriate
   adjustments of soil fertilization management strategies would therefore
   help to decrease the net CH4 flux to the atmosphere and hence the global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Increasing the risk of interruptions or shutdowns of supply chains, the
   development of multiple security initiatives to enhance security and
   resilience capability without affecting efficiency has become an
   important issue for multinational firms. This study aims to examine the
   enablers and performance outcomes of resilience capability in maritime
   firms from a relational perspective. Data collected from a questionnaire
   survey and a structural equation modeling (SEM) was subsequently
   performed to test the research hypotheses. Results indicate that
   relationship orientation is positively related to maritime firms'
   security management practices and resilience capability, whereas
   security management practices are positively associated with maritime
   firms' resilience capability and cargo operational performance.
   Moreover, results reveal that resilience capability is positively
   associated with cargo operational performance. Although the direct
   impact of relationship orientation on cargo operational performance was
   not found in this study, security management practices are found to play
   a mediating role. The finding implies that relationship orientation
   indirectly affects cargo operational performance via security management
   practices and resilience capability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have a range of impacts on Pacific Island
   ecosystems and the services they provide for current and future
   development. There are a number of characteristics that can make
   adaptation approaches that utilise the benefits of ecosystems a
   compelling and viable alternative to other adaptation approaches. The
   objective of this paper is to determine what level of relative influence
   technical and planning considerations currently have in guiding the
   recognition and application of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)
   approaches in the Pacific Islands context. The technical feasibility of
   EbA in relation to the expected impacts of climate change and the
   compatibility of adaptation planning processes of the Pacific Islands
   with EbA requirements was considered. The main barrier to fully
   implementing EbA in the Pacific Islands is not likely to be financial
   capital, but a combination of stable technical capacity within
   government departments to advise communities on EbA opportunities and
   the compatibility of planning frameworks.},

Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is a key climate
   mitigation technology that can global CO2 emissions by thousands of
   megatonnes of CO2 annually. CCS is almost certainly required, along with
   a wide portfolio of other technologies in an ``all of the above{''}
   strategy, to achieve the reductions in global CO2 emissions necessary to
   stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Despite many high-profile
   demonstration projects, commercial-scale CCS deployment is still impeded
   by multiple issues including economic viability, public awareness and
   acceptance, and regulation and permitting. Developing a large-scale,
   highly visible and economically feasible CCS network-in addition to
   existing investment approaches-will be required to overcome these
   barriers to widespread CCS adoption. We propose a pathway to an
   integrated CCS network that connects multiple industrial CO2 sources and
   geologic storage reservoirs using existing CCS technologies.
   Specifically, we propose that such a network could utilize CO2 emissions
   from ethylene manufacturing for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the U.S.
   Gulf Coast region, creating a regional ethylene: CO2-EOR network. The
   ethylene market presents several key advantages for capturing CO2:
   ethylene is a high-value chemical with a price that can readily absorb
   capture costs (unlike fossil fuel electricity generation), ethylene
   sources are both closely clustered and emit a large volume of CO2, and
   existing capture technology is cost-competitive when coupled with nearby
   EOR reservoirs. Our analysis describes the techno-economic potential of
   CO2 capture and EOR, the potential policy implications, and how the
   ethylene industry could be an ideal first-mover for jumpstarting
   commercial-scale CCS operations. As part of this analysis we identify
   the costs and CO2 flows for ethylene production and EOR across the Gulf
   Coast region. We introduce the concepts of ``byproduct CO2{''} (CO2 as a
   byproduct or waste stream from an existing industry such as power
   generation) and ``extracted CO2{''} (naturally-occurring CO2 extracted
   from subsurface reservoirs for EOR); extracted CO2 cannot decrease the
   carbon footprint of oil production, unlike byproduct CO2. We also
   suggest ethylene: CO2-EOR as a blueprint for other regional-scale
   byproduct CO2-E OR projects such as the Alberta oil sands, Marcellus and
   other U.S. shale fields, and large-scale coal-to-liquid and
   coal-to-chemical operations in China. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper adds to a limited literature eliciting willingness to pay
   (WTP) for mitigation measures against natural hazards caused by climate
   change, on coastal and marine environments. Our case study is Santander,
   a coastal region in Northern Spain. The case-study specific natural
   hazards concern (a) sea-level rise, high tides and extreme wave events
   that lead to floods and beach erosion, (b) rise in sea temperature that
   leads to invasive jellyfish blooms and changes in native biodiversity.
   In particular, we employ a choice experiment (CE) to elicit the value
   locals place on improvements, through the implementation of appropriate
   mitigation measures, in biodiversity, recreational opportunities and on
   decreases in health risks associated with jellyfish blooms. Results
   suggest that people value positively benefits in terms of increased
   biodiversity and recreation opportunities, as well as health risk
   reductions, and point to interesting policy implications. (C) 2014

Abstract = {The connection between climatic change and social response is complex
   because change articulates a number of inter-related factors. Human
   decisions are filtered by social buffers - including social memory, risk
   perception, and cultural priorities - and the rate and scale of climate
   change is usually much larger than the scale of human decision-making.
   In this article, we provide information on climate change based on
   precisely dated speleothems with the response evident in archaeological
   sites that have radiocarbon date ranges within the same time frame. A
   stalagmite recovered from within the catchment area for aquifer recharge
   of the Pre-Arawak site of Angostura in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, shows
   that a significant wet period occurred between 3.9 and 3.1ka (primarily
   centered at 3.5ka). We investigate the effect that this increase in
   precipitation had on the earliest occupations on the island in the
   context of palaeoenvironmental, geoarchaeological, and archaeological
   records from Angostura, Maruca, and Paso del Indio. Our analysis
   suggests the presence of two different adaptation strategies: settlement
   relocation and microlandscape modification. Our study concludes that the
   social response to change cannot be seen as monolithic given that human
   behavior, even within the same period, addresses the needs of individual
   groups with different priorities. This multiplicity of responses can
   indeed enhance resilience as social support can continue through
   alliances and exchanges, strengthening social bonds that can help buffer
   catastrophes. The results can help shed light on the range of adaptation
   strategies to change encompassed within the manifestations of social
   resilience or vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Freshwater aquaculture provides employment and offers often reliable
   income to impecunious communities in the Sundarban delta of India, a
   UNESCO declared world heritage site while it has been threatened by
   recent environmental and climatic changes. Based on household survey our
   study provides data on i) how local farmers perceive climate change in
   general, ii) prevailing freshwater aquaculture scenarios and potential
   impacts of the climate change on aquaculture, and iii) which strategies
   aquaculture farmers employ to cope with the perceived risks. The study
   reveals that farmers are aware of climatic variability and express their
   experiences of changes in temperature, rainfall, tropical cyclones and
   sea level rise. The production methods of freshwater aquaculture in
   Sundarban can be termed as `semi-improved low-input carp polyculture'.
   Cyclones and storm surges are the most significant climatic phenomena
   and severely affect freshwater aquaculture due to subsequent coastal
   flooding, and sea-level rise that cumulatively lead to salinity
   intrusion, followed by rising air temperature and drought. In relation
   to perceived risks, farmers are currently dealing with the problems
   through short-term coping measures which need scientific improvements to
   give long-term relief to the farmers. Considering the effects of climate
   change on freshwater pond aquaculture in the delta, we propose some
   preliminary policy recommendations that need to be introduced to cope
   with the challenges.},

Abstract = {There is growing attention to the use of greenery in urban areas, in
   various forms and functions, as an instrument to reduce the impact of
   human activities on the urban environment. The aim of this study has
   been to investigate the use of green roofs as a strategy to reduce the
   urban heat island effect and to improve the thermal comfort of indoor
   and outdoor environments. The effects of the built-up environment, the
   presence of vegetation and green roofs, and the urban morphology of the
   city of Turin (Italy) have been assessed considering the land surface
   temperature distribution. This analysis has considered all the
   information recorded by the local weather stations and satellite images,
   and compares it with the geometrical and typological characteristics of
   the city in order to find correlations that confirm that greenery and
   vegetation improve the livability of an urban context. The results
   demonstrate that the land-surface temperature, and therefore the air
   temperature, tend to decrease as the green areas increase. This trend
   depends on the type of urban context. Based on the results of a
   green-roofs investigation of Turin, the existing and potential green
   roofs are respectively almost 300 (257,380 m(2)) and 15,450 (6,787,929
   m(2)). Based on potential assessment, a strategy of priority was
   established according to the characteristics of building, to the
   presence of empty spaces, and to the identification of critical areas,
   in which the thermal comfort conditions are poor with low vegetation.
   This approach can be useful to help stakeholders, urban planners, and
   policy makers to effectively mitigate the urban heat island (UHI),
   improve the livability of the city, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and gain thermal comfort conditions, and to identify policies
   and incentives to promote green roofs.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems can sustain social adaptation to environmental change by
   protecting people from climate change effects and providing options for
   sustaining material and non-material benefits as ecological structure
   and functions transform. Along adaptation pathways, people navigate the
   trade-offs between different ecosystem contributions to adaptation, or
   adaptation services (AS), and can enhance their synergies and
   co-benefits as environmental change unfolds. Understanding trade-offs
   and co-benefits of AS is therefore essential to support social
   adaptation and requires analysing how people co-produce AS. We analysed
   co-production along the three steps of the ecosystem cascade: (i)
   ecosystem management; (ii) mobilization; and (iii) appropriation, social
   access and appreciation. Using five exemplary case studies across
   socio-ecosystems and continents, we show how five broad mechanisms
   already active for current ecosystem services can enhance co-benefits
   and minimize trade-offs between AS: (1) traditional and multi-functional
   land/sea management targeting ecological resilience; (2) pro-active
   management for ecosystem transformation; (3) co-production of novel
   services in landscapes without compromising other services; (4)
   collective governance of all co-production steps; and (5) feedbacks from
   appropriation, appreciation of and social access to main AS. We conclude
   that knowledge and recognition of co-production mechanisms will enable
   pro-active management and governance for collective adaptation to
   ecosystem transformation. This article is part of the theme issue
   `Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.},

Title = {Effects of land use and forest management on soil carbon in the
   ecoregions of Maryland and adjacent eastern United States},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {448},
Pages = {34-47},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The impacts of forest-related land use and management on soil organic
   carbon (SOC) stocks have been investigated through years of primary
   research and review articles. This attention is justified given the
   importance of land use and management to greenhouse gas mitigation, soil
   and forest productivity, and other ecosystem services. However, there is
   a gap of scale and scope between site-level studies that control for
   sources of variation, producing high-confidence results for limited
   locations, and the broad reviews that offer more general conclusions.
   The present analysis is intended to fill that gap. Here, we focus on six
   ecoregions of the eastern United States, and integrate meta-analysis of
   published literature with synthesis of geo-referenced soil observations
   to: (1) test whether common land use and management practices
   quantitatively impact SOC; (2) identify key sources of variation in
   these effects; (3) assess how sources of variation translate to
   decisions about land use and management at ecoregional to landscape
   levels. Results corroborate general trends, such as O horizon SOC losses
   with harvesting and fire and SOC gains during reforestation, but provide
   greater detail about the influence of specific practices and site-level
   controls on SOC stocks and change in the study region. Results also show
   that: (1) harvest impacts depend upon landform and soil taxonomy; (2)
   harvesting forests that are recovering on previously cultivated lands
   decreases SOC; (3) tree biomass and SOC recovery increase concurrently
   during reforestation; (4) specific harvest, site preparation, and fire
   management practices affect the magnitude and variability of changes in
   SOC. Perhaps more importantly, ecoregional classification and soil
   taxonomy provide spatial frameworks for placing quantitative estimates
   of SOC stocks and changes in the geographic context of the study region,
   providing greater detail and specificity for individuals and
   institutions concerned with SOC management at more localized levels.},

Title = {Governance conditions for adaptive freshwater management in the
   Vietnamese Mekong Delta},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {557},
Pages = {116-127},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is a region of utmost importance to
   Vietnam's national food security. However, the availability of required
   freshwater resources (from both surface and groundwater sources) is
   currently under great threats due to dry season salinity intrusion,
   surface water pollution, and over-exploitation of groundwater. Global
   climate change, sea level rise, and upstream and in situ development
   activities may worsen the situation. Assuming that adaptive management
   could be a promising strategy to address the increasingly complex and
   unpredictable water-related problems in the VMD, we design and apply a
   framework to identify the extent to which the governance regime in this
   region exhibits conditions that are likely to promote adaptive
   freshwater management. Using both primary and secondary data, our
   analysis reveals that the prospects for adaptive water management in the
   study area are limited since several conditions were not present. We
   observe among others limitations in vertical and horizontal integration
   and public participation, restraints in knowledge and information
   sharing, inadequate policy development and implementation, and
   insufficient diversification of financial resources. Following our
   findings, we conclude the paper with recommendations both for national,
   regional and local policy interventions and for future research. (C)

Title = {Urban design parameters for heat mitigation in tropics},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {According to United Nations, cities situated in the tropical belt occupy
   only 36\% of the Earth's surface yet account for 1/3 of the entire
   global population. The increasing number of compact dense cities and the
   rapid population growth in the tropics have also been accompanied by
   increased urban air temperature. Increased air temperature is often
   associated with heat waves, and increased energy consumption. Therefore,
   the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon and thermal stress have received
   much research attention and, as a result, the establishment of heat
   mitigation technologies has become critical. Although studies on urban
   climate in the tropics have shown progress, the situation in these areas
   remains complex and warrants further investigation. Accordingly, this
   paper examines the available heat mitigation techniques and their
   effectiveness in tropical areas from five perspectives, namely, shading
   (modifications in urban geometry), urban ventilation (street
   orientation, sun, and wind), urban greening (green roofs, trees, parks,
   and walls), albedo, and water bodies. This review paper showed that
   adopting a combination of mitigation approaches is the most effective
   method in reducing temperature in tropical cities. The use of shading
   and/or urban ventilation has also been proven to be more promising than
   the extensive use of vegetation, water bodies, or albedo modifications
   in reducing air temperature in tropical cities, where there is already a
   high level of humidity exists. Some key planning actions to combat UHI
   and thermal discomfort in tropical areas are eventually provided that
   can help urban planners integrate urban climatic knowledge into their
   practices.},

Title = {The adaptation-resistance spectrum: A classification of contemporary
   adaptation approaches to climate-related coastal change},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {94},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {90-98},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The realisation of climate change and its potential impacts on coastal
   environments and coastal communities has prompted much activity in the
   realm of `adaptation'. Adaptation is typically viewed as actions in
   response to climate change that seek to limit its impacts and/or bring
   some benefit to human society. In this paper we consider adaptation
   actions in response to the twin risks of coastal flooding and recession
   both of which are likely to increase in frequency/rate and magnitude as
   a result of global climate change. Adaptation actions are classified on
   a spectrum based on the degree of planned modification of (i) human
   activities or (ii) the physical coastal environment.
   At one end of the spectrum is a set of activities that involve changing
   human activities to suit the changing environment (e.g. innovative
   building design, relocation of infrastructure and/or people, changing
   landuse or livelihoods). At the other extreme are activities (e.g.
   building or raising flood defences, building or strengthening seawalls,
   nourishing beaches) that involve resisting environmental change in order
   to preserve existing infrastructure and human activities. Between these
   two extremes are a few initiatives that involve components of both
   approaches. A qualitative review of current practice suggests that most
   adaptation activity is in the category of seeking to preserve human
   activities and infrastructure. This form of response is better termed
   `resistance' than `adaptation'. These conservative and short-term goals
   of protecting fixed assets and existing activities, are damaging to the
   environment, involve significant cost and increase future risk of
   catastrophic failure. Those measures that involve adaptation of human
   activities in response to the changing coastal environment are likely to
   be more sustainable in the longer term, but are politically more
   difficult to implement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recently many problems have been caused by climate change. Measures in
   respond to natural disaster are searched for in various fields such as
   water management, energy, ecosystem, and health science. Resilient
   policies are being prepared to prevent disaster from flooding and
   drought through water management system, social infrastructure and green
   growth. Safety management for flood damage mitigation are being
   implemented through the regulation and public-private cooperation. This
   study aims to suggest new strategies planning of water management and
   land use in response to abnormal weather which allow waterfront spaces
   to be the cities by providing facilities and public spaces through the
   experience of resilient project in the Netherlands. Dutch national
   resilient policy and strategy is to developed multi-dimensional approach
   for flood risk which structure based on the spatial planning focused
   response. Feature of the Dutch water source management policies changed
   from the old water management as command and control focused on
   solution, monistic, rapid outflow of water with pumping, dikes, and
   drainage by hierarchical and closed sectoral water policy to the new
   water management of 21st as prevention and anticipation focused on
   design, retention and natural storage, participatory and interactive
   specific water by pluralistic societal anticipative and adaptive
   integral spatial policy. The water control strategy, for flexibly
   responding to the sea level rise and flooding caused by the climate
   change through the experience of Dutch resilience, is as follows: 1)
   Customized prevention plan according to the local property 2) Creating
   spatial planning by considering disaster risk level and fragility 3)
   Establishing urban planning by considering the flood risk level. (C)

Abstract = {Asian countries with large populations concentrated in coastal cities
   are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as sea level
   rise. This, in turn, can adversely affect water resources as a result of
   flooding, coastal erosion, water scarcity etc. Singapore has been hailed
   for its progressive water policies and practices, which were developed
   to overcome its natural resource disadvantage (limited resource base)
   and to achieve self-sufficiency. Certainly, Singapore's geopolitical
   situation may have provided an atmosphere conducive to the development
   of progressive policies; however, it is worth exploring how Singapore is
   preparing for climate change adaptation, as this may allow other
   cities/countries to learn from Singapore's experience. The paper
   evaluates the contribution of Singapore's water policies and practices
   to climate change adaptation, and examines whether they can support the
   development of adaptation strategies in the water sector for other
   similarly situated cities in vulnerable countries. Copyright (c) 2013

   Hazards and Sea Level Rise: A Case Study from Imperial Beach, California},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sea level rise increases community risks from erosion, wave flooding,
   and tides. Current management typically protects existing development
   and infrastructure with coastal armoring. These practices ignore
   long-term impacts to public trust coastal recreation and natural
   ecosystems. This adaptation framework models physical responses to the
   public beach and private upland for each adaptation strategy over time,
   linking physical changes in widths to damages, economic costs, and
   benefits from beach recreation and nature using low-lying Imperial
   Beach, California, as a case study. Available coastal hazard models
   identified community vulnerabilities, and local risk communication
   engagement prioritized five adaptation approaches-armoring, nourishment,
   living shorelines, groins, and managed retreat. This framework innovates
   using replacement cost as a proxy for ecosystem services normally not
   valued and examines a managed retreat policy approach using a public
   buyout and rent-back option. Specific methods and economic values used
   in the analysis need more research and innovation, but the framework
   provides a scalable methodology to guide coastal adaptation planning
   everywhere. Case study results suggest that coastal armoring provides
   the least public benefits over time. Living shoreline approaches show
   greater public benefits, while managed retreat, implemented sooner,
   provides the best long-term adaptation strategy to protect community
   identity and public trust resources.},

Abstract = {Coastal cities are vulnerable to flooding, and flood risk to coastal
   cities will increase due to sea-level rise. Moreover, Asian cities in
   particular are subject to considerable population growth and associated
   urban developments, increasing this risk even more. Empirical data on
   vulnerability and the cost and benefits of flood risk reduction measures
   are therefore paramount for sustainable development of these cities.
   This paper presents an approach to explore the impacts of sea-level rise
   and socio-economic developments on flood risk for the flood-prone
   District 4 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and to develop and evaluate the
   effects of different adaptation strategies (new levees, dry-and wet
   proofing of buildings and elevating roads and buildings).
   A flood damage model was developed to simulate current and future flood
   risk using the results from a household survey to establish stage-damage
   curves for residential buildings. The model has been used to assess the
   effects of several participatory developed adaptation strategies to
   reduce flood risk, expressed in expected annual damage (EAD). Adaptation
   strategies were evaluated assuming combinations of both sea-level
   scenarios and land-use scenarios. Together with information on costs of
   these strategies, we calculated the benefit-cost ratio and net present
   value for the adaptation strategies until 2100, taking into account
   depreciation rates of 2.5\% and 5 \%.
   The results of this modelling study indicate that the current flood risk
   in District 4 is USD0.31 million per year, increasing up to USD 0.78
   million per year in 2100. The net present value and benefit-cost ratios
   using a discount rate of 5\% range from USD-107 to -1.5 million, and
   from 0.086 to 0.796 for the different strategies. Using a discount rate
   of 2.5\% leads to an increase in both net present value and benefit-cost
   ratio. The adaptation strategies wet-proofing and dry-proofing generate
   the best results using these economic indicators. The information on
   different strategies will be used by the government of Ho Chi Minh City
   to determine a new flood protection strategy. Future research should
   focus on gathering empirical data right after a flood on the occurring
   damage, as this appears to be the most uncertain factor in the risk
   assessment.},

Abstract = {Climate change is now considered the greatest long-term threat to coral
   reefs, with some future change inevitable despite mitigation efforts.
   Managers must therefore focus on supporting the natural resilience of
   reefs, requiring that resilient reefs and reef regions be identified. We
   develop a framework for assessing resilience and trial it by applying
   the framework to target management responses to climate change on the
   southern Great Barrier Reef. The framework generates a resilience score
   for a site based on the evaluation of 19 differentially weighted
   indicators known or thought to confer resilience to coral reefs. Scores
   are summed, and sites within a region are ranked in terms of (1) their
   resilience relative to the other sites being assessed, and (2) the
   extent to which managers can influence their resilience. The framework
   was applied to 31 sites in Keppel Bay of the southern Great Barrier
   Reef, which has a long history of disturbance and recovery. Resilience
   and `management influence potential' were both found to vary widely in
   Keppel Bay, informing site selection for the staged implementation of
   resilience-based management strategies. The assessment framework
   represents a step towards making the concept of resilience operational
   to reef managers and conservationists. Also, it is customisable, easy to
   teach and implement and effective in building support among local
   communities and stakeholders for management responses to climate change.},

Volume = {574},

Abstract = {New Swiss legislation obligates hydropower plant owners to reduce
   detrimental impacts on rivers ecosystems caused by hydropealdng. We used
   a case study in the Swiss Alps (hydropower company Kraftwerke Oberhasli
   AG) to develop an efficient and successful procedure for the ecological
   evaluation of such impacts, and to predict the effects of possible
   mitigation measures. We evaluated the following scenarios using 12
   biotic and abiotic indicators: the pre-mitigation scenario (i.e. current
   state), the future scenario with increased turbine capacity but without
   mitigation measures, and future scenarios with increased turbine
   capacity and four alternative mitigation measures. The evaluation was
   based on representative hydrographs and quantitative or qualitative
   prediction of the indicators. Despite uncertainties in the ecological
   responses and the future operation mode of the hydropower plant, the
   procedure allowed the most appropriate mitigation measure to be
   identified. This measure combines a basin and a cavern at a total
   retention volume of 80,000 m(3), allowing for substantial dampening in
   the flow falling and ramping rates and in turn considerable reduction in
   stranding risk for juvenile trout and in macroinvertebrate drift. In
   general, this retention volume had the greatest predicted ecological
   benefit and can also, to some extent, compensate for possible
   modifications in the hydropower operation regime in the future, e.g. due
   to climate change, changes in the energy market, and changes in river
   morphology. Furthermore, it also allows for more specific seasonal
   regulations of retention volume during ecologically sensitive periods
   (e.g. fish spawning seasons). Overall experience gained from our case
   study is expected to support other hydropeaking mitigation projects. (C)

Abstract = {Climate change and its impacts are already perceptible in many parts of
   the world and coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to these
   changes. To address issues arising in the Aquitaine region (south-west
   France, now administratively part of Nouvelle-Aquitaine), we listed
   possible measures for adaptation to climate change impacts at the
   regional level and focussing on coastal hazards. Then we assessed their
   effectiveness with respect to long-term climate change and to the
   coastal management practices they are designed for. The assessment is
   independent of the local context and is therefore valid in most coastal
   areas.
   For this purpose, we conducted a review of the literature to select 51
   measures that are potentially applicable to the Aquitaine coast. We then
   classified these measures combining two approaches. The first was based
   on the regional management practices applied by the GIP Littoral
   Aquitain (a public interest group for coastal management in
   Nouvelle-Aquitaine) while the second drew on the IPCC (Intergovernmental
   Panel for Climate Change) classification based on the
   physical-environmental, socio-economic or institutional characteristics
   of adaptation measures. In parallel, ten criteria were defined to assess
   the current and future efficiency of the measure independently of the
   local context. Finally, by providing an assessment of the adaptation
   measures using nine of these criteria, this method allowed objective and
   easy comparisons between measures.
   The results were analysed taking each criterion independently and also
   through a multi-criteria analysis. Overall, the measures performed well
   against all the binary criteria except ``self-sufficiency{''} and
   ``synergy with mitigation{''}. The more detailed analysis of the results
   highlight the main characteristics of the measures applied in each
   management approach. The multi-criteria analysis identified a set of
   essential measures for adaptation to coastal risks in the context of
   climate change. 19 measures were rated at once as ``no regrets{''},
   ``robust{''} and ``reversible/flexible{''}. In general, the study shows
   that there are many short and medium term possibilities for adaptation
   (2030-2050, 2080-2100) and emphasises the need to implement some of
   these as soon as possible. According to our study, measures that
   generate immediate benefits are overwhelmingly predominant (86\%).},

Abstract = {Planning for adaptation to climate change requires regionally relevant
   information on rising air and ocean temperatures, sea levels,
   increasingly frequent and intense storms, and other climate-related
   impacts. However, in many regions there are limited focused syntheses of
   the climate impacts, risks, and potential adaptation strategies for
   coastal marine areas and sectors. We report on a regional assessment of
   climate change impacts and recommendations for adaptation strategies in
   the NE Pacific Coast (British Columbia, Canada), conducted in
   collaboration with a regional planning and plan implementation
   partnership (Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast), aimed
   at bridging the gaps between climate science and regional adaptation
   planning. We incorporated both social and ecological aspects of climate
   change impacts and adaptations, and the feedback mechanisms which may
   result in both increased risks and opportunities for the following areas
   of interest: ``Ecosystems{''}, ``Fisheries and Aquaculture{''},
   ``Communities{''}, and ``Marine Infrastructure{''}. As next steps within
   the region, we propose proactive planning measures including
   communication of the key impacts and projections and cross-sectoral
   assessments of climate vulnerability and risk to direct decision-making.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is one of the largest emerging and significant
   environmental threats for the aquaculture industry, jeopardizing its
   role as an alternative for supporting food security. Moreover, market
   conditions, characterized by price volatility and low value-added
   products, could exacerbate the industry's vulnerability to OA. We use a
   literature review on the biological consequences of OA over marine
   commercial species attributes to inform the empirical assessment of
   consumers' preferences for those attributes affected by OA, and
   consumers' responses to a set of market adaptation strategies suggested
   by the industry. We found that OA will have a negative impact on
   consumers' welfare due to the effects on commercial attributes of
   mussels aquaculture products. However, the main concerns for the
   industry are the market conditions. Thus, the industry's current
   adaptation strategies are focused on increasing their market share by
   offering new product assortments (with more value-added), regardless of
   the effect of OA on consumers' welfare. Despite this fact, the
   industry's strategies could eventually contribute to cope with OA since
   some specific segments of the market are willing to pay for new product
   assortments. This new market composition highlights the role of public
   institutions' reputation in issues related to food safety.},

Abstract = {It is claimed that country ownership enables equitable adaption by
   ensuring that adaptation interventions address priorities of local level
   vulnerable populations. This paper uses a framings approach to
   understand whether country owned interventions are aligned with local
   level adaptation needs. Three framing - the rights and responsibility,
   capabilities and recognition framings-are used to identify principles of
   justice reflected in adaptation interventions and compares them to those
   expressed by local level communities expected to benefit from these
   interventions. A case study of a Least Developed Countries Fund-funded
   and Global Environment Facility-administered coastal adaptation project
   in Tanzania is used. The analysis finds differences between framings by
   the project and local communities. The project portrays a rights and
   responsibilities framing with emphasis on government-led technocratic
   adaptation. Local level communities prioritize the capabilities framing,
   where local natural resource management institutions are considered
   necessary for mediating between resource access by resource-dependent
   households and resource conservation for coastal adaptation. The
   findings suggest that country ownership may not necessarily be equitable
   as local level adaptation priorities can fail to be reflected in country
   owned interventions.},

Abstract = {Arguments that fairness should be a guiding principle of climate change
   adaptation have been primarily concerned with distributive and
   procedural aspects of fairness, with far less attention paid to the
   temporal, spatial and interactional dimensions of fairness. This paper
   presents the results of a study that sought to understand the multiple
   dimensions of fairness of adaptation strategies that exist or can be
   developed to deal with sea-level rise. The study focused on five small
   communities along the south-east coast of Australia-Lakes Entrance,
   Seaspray, Port Albert, McLoughlins Beach and Manns Beach. Interviews
   were conducted with residents of the local communities to examine
   perceptions of current adaptation policies and their social impacts. A
   questionnaire was used to develop a nuanced understanding of the types
   of people living in these communities and their everyday lives,
   practices, and relationships. This enabled us to identify a range of
   non-material social impacts that may occur as a result of sea-level
   rise. Finally, focus groups were used to obtain community perspectives
   on the fairness of a range of potential future adaptation strategies.
   Together, these methods revealed that adaptation to sea-level rise is
   likely to affect some groups in the community significantly more than
   others, and in ways that will fundamentally change the nature of living
   in these communities. Understanding nuances in the social values of
   communities reveals how policies can be adapted to provide fairer
   outcomes for all community members through processes that create the
   time and space required to establish long-term working relationships
   between communities and government.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events and failure to adapt to the likely impacts of
   climate change are two of the most significant threats to humanity.
   Therefore, many local communities are preparing adaptation plans. Even
   so, much of what was done has not been published in the peer-reviewed
   literature. This means that consideration of adaptation options for
   local communities is limited. With the objective of assisting in the
   development of adaptation plans, we present 80 adaptation options
   suitable for coastal communities that can be applied by local
   governments. They are a catena of options from defend to co-exist and
   finally, retreat that progresses as impacts become less manageable.
   Options are organized according to their capacity to protect local
   properties and infrastructure, natural systems, food production,
   availability of fresh and drinking water and well-being of the local
   population, as these are likely to be affected by climate change. To
   respond to multiple threats, `soft' options, such as awareness raising,
   planning, political articulation and financial incentives, insurance and
   professional skills enhancement, can be encouraged immediately at
   relatively low cost and are reversible. For specific threats, options
   emphasize change in management practices as pre-emptive measures. Key
   audiences for this work are communities and local governments starting
   to consider priority actions to respond to climate change impacts.},

Title = {An indicator-based approach to quantifying the adaptive capacity of
   urban households: The case of Da Nang city, Central Vietnam},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Municipal governments have to contend with climate change dynamics with
   household-level adaptive capacity becoming an increasingly important
   component to the urban setting. However, methods in the quantification
   of adaptation, and what factors may drive adaptation at the urban
   household level, remain poorly resolved. In this study, we proposed an
   empirical approach and a set of 17 adaptive indicators to assess the
   adaptive capacity of urban households to climate change. The adaptive
   indicators were tested from three urban districts of the Da Nang city,
   Vietnam. A household survey using socioeconomic data was conducted in
   617 urban households. The empirical results showed that inherent
   capacity of urban households was relatively high in term of wealth,
   housing condition and durable assets, and low for livelihood diversity
   and knowledge to climate change. Six components, consisting of household
   economy, social relation, human capital, adaptation practices, municipal
   services and urban governance, and livelihood protection were extracted
   from the adaptive indicators. Of these, household economy, social
   relation, and adaptation practices were major factors determining the
   adaptation of urban households to climate change. The adaptive
   indicators present here, with appropriate modification, could be used to
   assess adaptive capacity of urban households to climate change from
   other coastal areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study examined measures and factors influencing the climate change
   adaptation decisions of smallholder farmers holding less than 0.5
   hectares of farmland. The binary logit model was applied to analyze data
   collected by face-to-face interviews with 110 households in Phu Vang
   Coastal District, Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The findings
   indicate that most farmers accurately perceived climate-related changes
   during the recent decade, and implemented various adaptation measures in
   an effort to alleviate the potential risks. Adaptations included
   changing crop varieties, adjusting farming calendar, diversifying crops,
   diversifying livestock, improving irrigation, and intensifying soil
   quality. In addition, the farming household adaptation decisions were
   positively affected by gender, education level, number of laborers,
   income level, involvement in local community organizations, and
   perception of climate change severity and adaptation measure efficacy.
   Farmer adaptations, in contrast, were negatively influenced by non-farm
   income and entirely unaffected by access to credit. Policy-related
   recommendations were proposed to encourage smallholder farmers to adapt
   to climate change in the region. Recommendations included (1)
   improvements in the understanding of climate change, especially for
   female and less educated farmers; (2) more attention paid to the
   activities of local community organizations to be more attractive for
   members; (3) participation in the non-agricultural sector in parallel
   with implementing climate change adaptation measures in agriculture; (4)
   preferential loans designed as targets for low-income households
   combined with strict management to avoid misuse by beneficiaries.},

Title = {GIS based coastal vulnerability assessment and adaptation barriers to
   coastal regulations in Dakshina Kannada district, India},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal areas represent fragile and complex ecosystems. Changes in
   climate, increasing urbanization and industrialization are creating
   immense pressure on the coastal environment. Coastal erosion, sea level
   rise, changing morphology of the coastal areas and extreme weather
   events are some of the threats that coastal regions are experiencing
   globally. While various studies have assessed the vulnerability of
   coastal regions quantitatively and spatially, there is a need to
   supplement these findings with qualitative insights based on human
   experiences. Thus, the present study carried out a coastal vulnerability
   assessment along the coastline of Dakshina Kannada district in
   Karnataka, India using Shannon's Entropy by including eight parameters
   i.e., slope, elevation, geomorphology, bathymetry, sea level rise, mean
   tidal range, mean significant wave height and shoreline change. The
   study also explored the experiences and perceptions of stakeholders
   regarding adaptation barriers to climate change vulnerabilities for
   understanding the ground complexities. Coastal vulnerability index (CVI)
   revealed that nearly 39.7 km of the coastline is vulnerable including
   areas along Sasihtlu beach, Munda, New Mangalore Port Batapady beach,
   Uchilla, Kotekar, Ullal beach, Netravati River Area and Mukka beach.
   Rainfall induced coastal erosion, lack of coordination among the various
   stakeholders, policy makers and practitioners regarding a common
   framework for climate change adaptation strategies were identified
   adaptation barriers. The findings of CVI and adaptation barriers may be
   used by practitioners and policy makers for framing the adaptation
   measures for mitigating the implications of the coastal region. (c) 2022

Title = {Adapting water resources systems to climate change in tropical areas:
   Ecuadorian coast},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {703},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase rainfall and temperature in the
   tropical areas of the Ecuadorian coast. The increase in temperature will
   also increase evapotranspiration therefore, future water balance on
   Ecuadorian coast will have a slight variation. Changes in precipitation
   patterns and evapotranspiration will produce an increase in the water
   requirements for current crops, so an imbalance in the water resources
   systems between natural resources and water demands is expected. This
   study presents water resources management as an adaptation measure to
   climate change for reducing vulnerability in tropical areas.
   Twelve bias-corrected climate projections are used, from: two AR5
   General Circulation Models (GCMs), two Representative Concentration
   Pathways, 4.5-8.5 scenarios, and three time periods, short-term
   (2010-2039), medium-term (2040-2069) and long-term (2070-2099). These
   data were incorporated into the Lumped Temez Hydrological Model. Climate
   change scenarios predict for the long-term period both a mean rainfall
   and temperature increases up to 22\%-2.8 degrees C, respectively.
   Besides, the potential evapotranspiration will increase until 12\% by
   Penman-Monteith method and 60\% by Thornthwaite method. Therefore,
   natural water resources will finally have an increase of 19\%
   {[}8-30\%]. Additionally, water requirements for crops will increase
   around 4\% and 45\%.
   As this research shows, in tropical regions, currently viable water
   resources systems could become unsustainable under climate change
   scenarios. To guarantee the water supply in the future additional
   measures are required as reservoir operation rules and irrigation
   efficiency improvement of system from 0.43 to 0.65, which it involves
   improving the distribution and application system. In study area future
   irrigation areas have been estimated for 13,268 ha, which under climate
   change scenarios is unsustainable, only 11,500 ha could be expanded with
   a very high irrigation efficiency of 0.73. Therefore, in tropical areas
   the effect of climate change on expansion projects for irrigated areas
   should be considered to ensure the functioning systems. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Numerous studies worldwide emphasize the impacts that cities now face
   due to increasing variability of weather extremes associated with
   climate change, exacerbating the urban heat island effect, air pollution
   and health impacts. In this respect, cities need to cope with these new
   threats and get prepared. One way of doing this is to develop climate
   change mitigation and adaptation strategies, focusing on local
   vulnerabilities in relation to the current societal development needs
   and adaptation options. There are many recent initiatives and examples
   for climate change adaptation strategies and plans for large cities, but
   only a few examples for small and medium-size cities. This paper
   investigates the mid-(2021-2050) and far-future (2071-2100) climate
   change signals in an urban area located in northern Romania (Baia Mare
   town), with around 200,000 inhabitants, exploring the results of some
   CORDEX GCMs under the new IPCC RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The
   study analyzes these signals in relation to the local awareness of key
   institutional stakeholders, as well as to the current social and
   economic constraints towards considering the climate change adaptation.
   The findings, based on a survey, highlight how the local authorities
   perceive and include climate change aspects in their activities as an
   important step towards real implementation of specific climate-based
   decisions, as well as their needs in terms of climate information and
   data. The study provides useful scientific insights about future climate
   and expected impacts in the Baia Mare Urban System to stakeholders,
   which could increase their awareness and knowledge in terms of climate
   change.},

Title = {Developing Heat Mitigation Strategies in the Urban Environment of
   Sydney, Australia},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Heat island effects raise the ambient air temperature in metropolitan
   areas by 4-5 degrees Celsius and can reach 10 degrees Celsius at their
   maximum. This phenomenon magnifies cities' energy difficulties while
   reducing comfort. Mitigation strategies have been developed and
   recommended to deal with the issue. Methods to increase albedo and the
   utilisation of vegetation appear to be the most promising, with a
   reasonably high heat island reduction capacity. This paper examines the
   heat mitigation techniques and their effectiveness under Sydney's
   climate conditions and compares strategies. We implement two
   perspectives, namely urban greening (green roofs, green pavements) and
   albedo (street, roof), and characterise urban surface structures, and
   Envi-met software is employed for our simulation method. Mitigation
   strategies show a cooling potential of 4.1 degrees C in temperature
   along this precinct during the heatwave period. Scenarios that increase
   high-albedo material on the road, pavements and rooftops and full
   mitigation show the maximum cooling potential. The mitigation strategies
   have higher predicted cooling potential on the peak ambient temperature,
   up to 1.18 degrees C, while having no or little impact on minimum
   ambient temperature. The outdoor thermal comfort based on PMV indices
   varies between a minimum of -0.33 in scenario seven in large layout
   areas to 3. However, the mitigation scenario presents more acceptable
   outdoor thermal comfort, but large layouts are predicted to have a hot
   condition.},

Abstract = {Urban green infrastructure (UGI) has been increasingly promoted as a key
   measure to mitigate heat stress in cities caused by the urban heat
   island effect and climate change impacts, including climate variability
   and extremes. However, comparable information concerning the performance
   of different UGI types to moderate such impacts is mostly lacking. This
   creates serious challenges for urban planners who need to decide on the
   most effective measures while considering spatial and administrative
   constraints. This study investigates how different types and quantities
   of UGI, i.e. trees, green roofs, and green facades, affect pedestrian
   thermal comfort. The study was applied to high-density residential areas
   under current and future climatic conditions. Climate change will on
   average increase afternoon Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET)
   values by 2.4 K; however, this could be vastly reduced by different UGI
   scenarios. Planting trees had the strongest impact with an average PET
   reduction of 13\% compared with existing vegetation. Trees shade open
   spaces and provide evapotranspirative cooling. Another valuable
   adaptation option is green facades, which have mitigating effects of
   5\%-10\%. In contrast, the effects of green roofs were negligible. Our
   results indicate that increasing the share of green cover did not
   directly correspond to the magnitude of the PET reduction. Placing
   vegetation strategically in heat-exposed areas is more effective than
   just aiming at a high percentage of green cover. We conclude that our
   extensive comparative analysis provides empirical evidence to support
   UGI on the micro-scale and assists planners and decision-makers to
   effectively select and prioritise concrete measures to adapt to climate
   change. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Coastal flooding affects physical and social place attachments.
   Values-based approaches to climate change adaptation examine how risks
   to place attachments are distributed within and among communities, with
   a view to informing equitable adaptation policies. In this nascent body
   of research, divergent theoretical frameworks and empirical approaches
   to measuring social values are evolving. While some studies explore the
   things people value about their everyday lives generally-the lived
   values approach, others locate specific social and cultural values in
   geographic space-the landscape values mapping approach. This study aims
   to compare the explanatory value of these two approaches for
   understanding the social risks of sea-level rise, and appraise whether
   either or both approaches are likely to meet local adaptation planning
   needs. It does this by examining the potential social impacts of
   sea-level rise in Kingston Beach, Australia, informed by a mail-out
   survey of the community. The lived values approach identified that the
   natural environment, scenery, relaxed lifestyle and safety are highly
   important to local residents, while the landscape values mapping
   approach revealed that Kingston Main Beach is the most highly valued of
   eight coastal landscape units. Incorporating the landscape values
   mapping into the lived values cluster analysis revealed that while
   Kingston Main Beach is highly important for its recreational value to
   some members of the community, for others manmade features such as
   community halls or sports ovals may be of higher importance because they
   facilitate social interactions. There is potential to further integrate
   these two approaches to better inform adaptation policy about how lived
   and landscape values are distributed among communities, where they are
   located in space and whether they change over time. A deeper
   understanding of such assigned values can lead to improved engagement
   with coastal residents to inform adaptation policy now and into the
   future.},

Title = {Population Health Adaptation Approaches to the Increasing Severity and

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewRecent changes in our planetary climate have and will
   continue to challenge historical knowledge and risk assumptions for
   weather-related disasters. While the public health community is rapidly
   working to develop epidemiological approaches and tools to mitigate and
   adapt to these weather-related disasters, recent high-profile events
   have exposed gaps in knowledge and response efforts. Limited work has
   been done to assess the climate readiness of the local public health and
   healthcare community as it pertains to local response planning and
   adaptation measures in the event of a weather-related disaster. The
   purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature related to
   climate change, weather-related disasters, and population health
   approaches to adapt to climate-related changes in weather-related
   disasters at the local level. We highlight a brief case study to
   illustrate an example of a local approach to adaptation planning in a
   coastal community.
   Recent Findings Few studies have put forth quantitative disaster
   epidemiology tools to aid public health officials in preparing for and
   responding to these weather-related disaster events. There is a general
   lack of understanding within the public health community about the
   epidemiological tools which are available to assist local communities in
   their preparation for, response to, and recovery from weather-related
   disasters.
   Summary Cities around the nation are already working to assess their
   vulnerability and resilience to weather-related disasters by including
   climate change in emergency preparedness plans and developing adaptation
   strategies, as well as equipping local hospitals, health departments and
   other critical public health systems with climate information. But more
   work is needed and public health funding is lagging to support local and
   state-level efforts in preparing for and adapting to weather-related
   disasters in the context of a changing climate. Our population health
   disaster preparedness programs need to be adapted to address the
   increasing risks to local public health resulting from our changing
   climate.},

Title = {Seismic surveys near gray whale feeding areas off Sakhalin Island,
   Russia: assessing impact and mitigation effectiveness},

Abstract = {In 2015, two oil and gas companies conducted seismic surveys along the
   northeast coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, near western gray whale
   (Eschrichtius robustus) feeding areas. This population of whales was
   listed as Critically Endangered at the time of the operations described
   here but has been reclassified as Endangered since 2018. The number and
   duration of the 2015 seismic surveys surpassed the level of previous
   seismic survey activity in this area, elevating concerns regarding
   disturbance of feeding gray whales and the potential for auditory
   injury. Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) developed a mitigation approach to
   address these concerns and, more importantly, implemented a
   comprehensive data collection strategy to assess the effectiveness of
   this approach. The mitigation approach prioritized completion of the
   seismic surveys closest to the nearshore feeding area as early in the
   season as possible, when fewer gray whales would be present. This was
   accomplished by increasing operational efficiency through the use of
   multiple seismic vessels and by establishing zones with specific
   seasonal criteria determining when air gun shutdowns would be
   implemented. These zones and seasonal criteria were based on pre-season
   modeled acoustic footprints of the air gun array and on gray whale
   distribution data collected over the previous 10 years. Real-time
   acoustic and whale sighting data were instrumental in the implementation
   of air gun shutdowns. The mitigation effectiveness of these shutdowns
   was assessed through analyzing short-term behavioral responses and
   shifts in gray whale distribution due to sound exposure. The overall
   mitigation strategy of an early survey completion was assessed through
   bioenergetics models that predict how reduced foraging activity might
   affect gray whale reproduction and maternal survival. This assessment
   relied on a total of 17 shore-based and 5 vessel-based teams collecting
   behavior, distribution, photo-identification, prey, and acoustic data.
   This paper describes the mitigation approach, the implementation of
   mitigation measures using real-time acoustic and gray whale location
   data, and the strategy to assess impacts and mitigation effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Small-scale mariculture of high-value species for trade in remote
   islands can offer valuable alternative livelihoods to local communities.
   The endangered giant clam species Tridacna maxima is naturally abundant
   in some atolls in French Polynesia (FP) and has been the focus of
   commercial mariculture activities since 2012. Shortly after spat
   collectors became operational in two atoll lagoons, FP rose to become
   one of the main exporters of giant clams for the aquarium trade.
   However, this activity has been threatened recently by a mass
   clam-bleaching event triggered by the 2015-2016 El Nino. This study
   reviews the roles that international (Convention on International Trade
   in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and national regulatory
   frameworks play in the development of this activity in a small island
   context, and how they can indirectly promote better science and
   monitoring in order to inform adaptive management strategies. The links
   between the nine main groups of stakeholders show the necessary
   adaptation measures required to mitigate climate-driven mortalities.
   While this case study remains specific to giant clam farming in FP,
   general lessons are provided that could help in mitigating economic
   impacts from climate-related events on other islands.},

Title = {A fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process approach for measuring flood
   resilience at the individual property level},

Abstract = {Purpose Recent changes in climate, rainfall patterns, snow melt and
   rising sea levels coupled with an increase in urban development have
   increased the threat of flooding. To curb these threats and mitigate
   these damages, property-level approaches to improving resilience are now
   being encouraged as part of an integrated approach to flood risk
   management. This raises questions such as, what are the flood resilient
   attributes within individual properties, what is their importance and
   how can these be quantified. This research sought to develop a
   quantitative approach for the measurement of property-level flood
   resilience. Design/methodology/approach A synthesis of literature was
   undertaken to establish the main resilient attributes and their relevant
   sub-attributes. This process led to the development of a new method,
   named the Composite Flood Resilient Index (CFRI) to weight the
   attributes and sub-attributes of flood resilience based on their
   importance. The approach adopts the use of the fuzzy-analytic hierarchy
   process (F-AHP) approach to quantify flood resilience. Findings The
   implications of the proposed methodology in determining the flood
   resilience of individual property, including the potential use in
   retrofitting activities, and the benefits to a range of stakeholders are
   considered. Social implications The methodology offers the potential to
   support the measurement of flood resilience of individual properties,
   allowing the identification and prioritisation of specific interventions

Title = {How harmful are restrictions on adapting to climate change?},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-45},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The dominant assumption in economic models of climate policy remains
   that adaptation will be implemented in an optimal manner. There are,
   however, several reasons why optimal levels of adaptation may not be
   attainable. This paper investigates the effects of suboptimal levels of
   adaptation caused by different types of adaptation restrictions, on the
   composition and level of climate change costs and on welfare. We find
   that especially restrictions to the effectiveness of adaptation at more
   extreme levels of climate change can be very harmful. Furthermore we
   show that the potential of mitigation to offset suboptimal adaptation
   varies from being essential in case adaptation becomes ineffective at
   higher temperature increases, to being largely ineffective in case of
   short-term inaction. However, in all cases the short-term recommendation
   is to increase mitigation levels slightly above what is normally
   recommended, and to keep mitigation policies flexible enough to be able
   to respond when adaptation restrictions become more prominent. It is
   clear that by reducing adaptation restrictions, in combination with
   adjusting the optimal level of mitigation may keep the costs of
   adaptation restrictions limited, and thus generally it is very harmful
   to ignore existing restrictions on adaptation when devising (efficient)
   climate policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Pacific climate change adaptation The use of participatory media to
   promote indigenous knowledge},
Journal = {PACIFIC JOURNALISM REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {112-131},
Abstract = {Pacific Island communities are increasingly experiencing the impacts of
   climate change. Inaccessibility to relevant information about
   contemporary climate change adaptation strategies at the community level
   presents challenges. At the same time, indigenous strategies to adapt to
   climate changes have been overlooked in both local and global climate
   change debates. This article discusses a project undertaken with a
   community in Andra Island, Manus Province, Papua New Guinea. Climate
   change impacts and adaptation strategies were explored through photo
   essays developed by community members, engaging in approaches of visual
   participatory action research and indigenous research approaches. The
   collaboration with the Andra Island community created a space for
   reflective dialogue about challenges posed by climate change as well as
   how photo essays can be used to promote Indigenous Knowledge (IK) as a
   viable capital for community-based adaptation (CBA). Within this
   context, this article demonstrates how climate change is both a natural
   and cultural process of change which poses socio-economic challenges.
   These challenges can compel people to engage in unsustainable practices
   that might exacerbate natural climate change impacts. The article
   highlights that building community capacity in participatory media can
   be an important tool to forge collective synergy, dialogue and ownership
   in local climate change initiatives. In particular, the authors
   demonstrate how participatory media can be harnessed to integrate
   indigenous knowledge in community-based climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Challenges to Mitigating the Urban Health Burden of Mosquito-Borne
   Diseases in the Face of Climate Change},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cities worldwide are facing ever-increasing pressure to develop
   mitigation strategies for all sectors to deal with the impacts of
   climate change. Cities are expected to house 70\% of the world's
   population by 2050, and developing related resilient health systems is a
   significant challenge. Because of their physical nature, cities' surface
   temperatures are often substantially higher than that of the surrounding
   rural areas, generating the so-called Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.
   Whilst considerable emphasis has been placed on strategies to mitigate
   against the UHI-associated negative health effects of heat and pollution
   in cities, mosquito-borne diseases have largely been ignored. However,
   the World Health Organization estimates that one of the main
   consequences of global warming will be an increased burden of
   mosquito-borne diseases, many of which have an urban facet to their
   epidemiology and thus the global population exposed to these pathogens
   will steadily increase. Current health mitigation strategies for heat
   and pollution, for example, may, however, be detrimental for
   mosquito-borne diseases. Implementation of multi-sectoral strategies
   that can benefit many sectors (such as water, labor, and health) do
   exist or can be envisaged and would enable optimal use of the meagre
   resources available. Discussion among multi-sectoral stakeholders should
   be actively encouraged.},

Title = {Coupling GIS spatial analysis and Ensemble Niche Modelling to
   investigate climate change-related threats to the Sicilian pond turtle
   Emys trinacris, an endangered species from the Mediterranean},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {The pond turtle Emys trinacris is an endangered endemic species of
   Sicily showing a fragmented distribution throughout the main island. In
   this study, we applied ``Ensemble Niche Modelling{''}, combining more
   classical statistical techniques as Generalized Linear Models and
   Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines with machine-learning
   approaches as Boosted Regression Trees and Maxent, to model the
   potential distribution of the species under current and future climatic
   conditions. Moreover, a ``gap analysis{''} performed on both the
   species' presence sites and the predictions from the Ensemble Models is
   proposed to integrate outputs from these models, in order to assess the
   conservation status of this threatened species in the context of
   biodiversity management. For this aim, four ``Representative
   Concentration Pathways{''}, corresponding to different greenhouse gases
   emissions trajectories were considered to project the obtained models to
   both 2050 and 2070. Areas lost, gained or remaining stable for the
   target species in the projected models were calculated. E. trinacris'
   potential distribution resulted to be significantly dependent upon
   precipitation-linked variables, mainly precipitation of wettest and
   coldest quarter. Future negative effects for the conservation of this
   species, because of more unstable precipitation patterns and extreme
   meteorological events, emerged from our analyses. Further, the sites
   currently inhabited by E. trinacris are, for more than a half, out of
   the Protected Areas network, highlighting an inadequate management of
   the species by the authorities responsible for its protection. Our
   results, therefore, suggest that in the next future the Sicilian pond
   turtle will need the utmost attention by the scientific community to
   avoid the imminent risk of extinction. Finally, the gap analysis
   performed in GIS environment resulted to be a very informative
   post-modeling technique, potentially applicable to the management of
   species at risk and to Protected Areas' planning in many contexts.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Climatic and non-climatic stressors, such as temperature increases,
   rainfall fluctuations, population growth and migration, pollution,
   land-use changes and inadequate gender-specific strategies, are major
   challenges to coastal agricultural sustainability. In this paper, we
   discuss all pertinent issues related to the sustainability of coastal
   agriculture under climate change. It is evident that some
   climate-change-related impacts (e.g., temperature and rainfall) on
   agriculture are similarly applicable to both coastal and non-coastal
   settings, but there are other factors (e.g., inundation, seawater
   intrusion, soil salinity and tropical cyclones) that particularly impact
   coastal agricultural sustainability. Coastal agriculture is
   characterised by low-lying and saline-prone soils where spatial
   competition with urban growth is an ever-increasing problem. We
   highlight how coastal agricultural viability could be sustained through
   blending farmer perceptions, adaptation options, gender-specific
   participation and integrated coastal resource management into policy
   ratification. This paper provides important aspects of the coastal
   agricultural sustainability, and it can be an inspiration for further
   research and coastal agrarian planning.},

Title = {Climate Change in South Asia},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY IN SOUTH ASIA},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {13-30},
Abstract = {South Asia, is home to over one fifth of the world's population and is
   known to be the most disaster prone region in the world. The high rates
   of population growth, and natural resource degradation, with continuing
   high rates of poverty and food insecurity make South Asia one of the
   most vulnerable regions to the impacts of climate change. In general,
   past and present climate trends and variability in South Asia can be
   characterized by increasing air temperatures and there is an increasing
   trend in the intensity and frequency of extreme events in South Asia
   over the last century. Temperature projections for South Asia for the
   twenty-first century suggest a significant acceleration of warming over
   that observed in the twentieth century. Recent modelling experiments
   indicate that the warming would be significant in Himalayan Highlands
   including the Tibetan Plateau and arid regions of Asia. An increase in
   occurrence of extreme weather events including heat wave and intense
   precipitation events is projected in South Asia, along with an increase
   in the interannual variability of daily precipitation in the Asian
   summer monsoon. The projected impacts of climate change in South Asia
   will vary across sectors, locations and populations. Temperature rise
   will negatively impact crop yields in tropical parts of South Asia where
   these crops are already being grown close to their temperature tolerance
   threshold. While direct impacts are associated with rise in
   temperatures, indirect impacts due to water availability and changing
   soil moisture status and pest and disease incidence are likely to be
   felt. The most significant impacts are likely to be borne by
   small-holder rainfed farmers who constitute the majority of farmers in
   this region and possess low financial and technical capacity to adapt to
   climate variability and change. The projected impacts of climate change
   in different parts of South Asia are described. The coping capacity of
   the rural poor, especially in the marginal areas, is low and there is a
   need to mainstream the good practices for adaptation to climate change
   into sustainable development planning in the region. Improved
   understanding of the climate change impacts, vulnerability and the
   adaptation practices to cope with climate change could help this
   process.},

Abstract = {Neighborhood has always been of significant interest to built
   environment stockholders as a basic planning unit. However, any
   discussion in these concerns, without drawing attention to sustainable
   microclimate approaches, would still in a mess at a time of increasing
   population and climate change. Emergence of the sustainable development
   concept at the mid-20th century and its emphasis led to increasing
   crucial role that the urban green infrastructure along with reflective
   materials can play in mitigating neighborhood microclimate's symptoms of
   climate change. Considering the lack of studies for urban heat island
   (UHI) in hot arid regions, particularly in Egypt and the limited number
   of studies concerning the numerical simulation of all mitigation
   strategies incorporated, this research studies the mitigation of UHI
   phenomenon in a case study in Cairo in present and future (2020, 2050
   and 2080) through applying the criteria of tree lines, green roofs, high
   albedo pavements and shading structures within the neighborhood
   sustainability assessment tool (Leadership in Energy and Environmental
   Design for Neighborhood; LEED-ND). The microclimatic numerical CFD
   simulations of ENVI-met 4.0 was used following the measurement of LAI
   and Albedo of selected Egyptian trees to assess UHI through air and
   radiant temperature differences before and after applying mitigation
   strategies. Results demonstrate a considerable ability to acclimatize
   the microclimate in terms of better conditions in present and future.},

Title = {Carbon balance of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations: A review of
   uncertainties at plot, landscape and production level},

Volume = {221},

Abstract = {Rapid expansion of natural rubber plantations in South-East Asia and
   other regions has greatly altered ecosystem based carbon (C) stocks with
   potential impacts on climate change mitigation and future C trading
   opportunities. Therefore, reliable estimations of carbon sequestration
   and emission at the landscape level after land cover transition from
   forest, swidden agriculture and other land use types are needed. We
   reviewed studies on C stocks and dynamics in rubber plantations
   considering the contribution of aboveground and belowground biomass,
   soil organic matter, collected latex and other minor components. C
   sequestration occurred after conversion of arable land to rubber
   plantations while C losses usually prevailed if forest was converted to
   rubber. These general trends strongly depended on local climate
   conditions and soil properties as well as on topography. Non-traditional
   planting of rubber under subtropical conditions with a dryer climate and
   at high elevations (300-1000 m above sea level) decreased the C
   sequestration potential of rubber. We show how rotation length, rubber
   clone, and management strategies like tapping frequency or planting
   density affect C stocks, discuss the uncertainties in C stock estimation
   and highlight improved approaches. An important conclusion is that
   upscaling of C stocks and dynamics under different climate scenarios and
   rotation lengths to a regional level requires the use of time averaged C
   stocks. Enhanced remote sensing techniques can greatly improve C stock
   estimates at the regional level, allowing for an accounting of the
   variability caused by terrain and plantation properties. A partial life
   cycle assessment of rubber production revealed greenhouse gas emissions
   as a minor contribution when compared to land use change effects on
   plant and soil C stocks and C accumulation in latex, wood products and
   seed oil. The review highlights scantily explored topics and proposes
   directions for future studies, which should decrease uncertainties in C
   estimates in rubber dominated landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Awareness of urban climate adaptation strategies -an international
   overview},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Problems caused by urban climate phenomena such as urban heat island
   intensification, nuisance winds, or the lack of ventilation, are a
   growing concern with urban population growth and aging infrastructure.
   While many possible solutions are known, effective adaptation strategies
   have been insufficiently implemented to ameliorate urban climate
   problems. Reasons for this `implementation gap' such as the level of
   awareness about implementable solutions have received little attention
   in the literature. An important question thus remains unanswered: what
   do different urban actors (citizens; politicians; urban planners and
   designers; and urban climate experts) who shape the urban environment
   and thus its climate, know about urban climate adaptation measures? We
   conducted a pilot study using semi-structured interviews with
   specialists in the field of urban sustainability related to urban
   planning and climate in ten countries worldwide. Interview results
   indicated that awareness of adaptation measures differs between
   countries, but even more so between different actor groups. Citizens and
   politicians are less aware than urban planners or designers and urban
   climate experts. Awareness raising should involve media campaigns,
   further education and display of good practice. Politicians should work
   on better laws and their enforcement and urban climate experts on good
   knowledge communication.},

Title = {Integration of the WUDAPT, WRF, and ENVI-met models to simulate extreme
   daytime temperature mitigation strategies in San Jose, California},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {184},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {An obstacle to the modeling of strategies to mitigate extreme urban
   temperatures is frequently the lack of on-site meteorological data. The
   current study thus reports on a method that used the Weather Research
   and Forecasting (WRF) model to generate inputs for the ENVI-met model to
   produce building-scale canyon temperatures within a 300 m square near
   downtown San Jose. A land use distribution was generated for WRF by a
   WUDAPT classification, and the days of interest were then the hottest
   day in California history and a typical summer day. The source of
   meteorological data for ENVI-met, run with a 1.5 m cubic grid, was
   either an urbanized version of WRF; its default version; or observations
   at the closest NWS site. All WRF simulations were run on a 1 km grid,
   and output at its grid closest to the study area provided ENVI-met with
   lateral boundary conditions. The mitigation strategy was comprised of
   three parts, which either increased vegetation, rooftop albedo, or
   architectural shade elements. Results showed all strategies with only
   negligible impacts on ENVI-met nighttime 1 m level street canyon
   temperatures. Increased vegetation, however, was the most effective
   daytime strategy on both days, as it affected the largest area. The
   maximum vegetative cooling on the extreme and average days was -3.5 and
   -3.3 degrees C, respectively. While increased rooftop albedos produced
   near negligible impacts, increased architectural shading produced
   corresponding values of -1.6 and -1.7 degrees C, respectively.},

Title = {Allowable carbon emissions for medium-to-high mitigation scenarios},
Journal = {TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {65},
Abstract = {Using an ensemble of simulations with an intermediate complexity climate
   model and in a probabilistic framework, we estimate future ranges of
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in order to follow three medium-high
   mitigation concentration pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and SCP4.5 to 2.6.
   Uncertainty is first estimated by allowing modelled equilibrium climate
   sensitivity, aerosol forcing and intrinsic physical and biogeochemical
   processes to vary within widely accepted ranges. Results are then
   constrained by comparison against contemporary measurements. For both
   constrained and unconstrained projections, our calculated allowable
   emissions are close to the standard (harmonised) emission scenarios
   associated with these pathways. For RCP4.5, which is the most moderate
   scenario considered in terms of required emission abatement, then after
   year 2100 very low net emissions are needed to maintain prescribed year
   2100 CO2 concentrations. As expected, RCP2.6 and SCP4.5 to 2.6 require
   more strict emission reductions. The implication of this is that direct
   sequestration of carbon dioxide is likely to be required for RCP4.5 or
   higher mitigation scenarios, to offset any minimum emissions for society
   to function (the `emissions floor'). Despite large uncertainties in the
   physical and biogeochemical processes, constraints from
   model-observational comparisons support a high degree of confidence in
   predicting the allowable emissions consistent with a particular
   concentration pathway. In contrast the uncertainty in the resulting
   temperature range remains large. For many parameter sets, and especially
   for RCP2.6, the land will turn into a carbon source within the 21st
   century, but the ocean will remain as a carbon sink. For land carbon
   storage and our modelling framework, major reductions are seen in
   northern high latitudes and the Amazon basin even after atmospheric CO2
   is stabilised, while for ocean carbon uptake, the tropical ocean regions
   will be a source to the atmosphere, although uncertainties on this are
   large. The parameters which most significantly affect the allowable
   emissions are aerosols and climate sensitivity, but some carbon-cycle
   related parameters (e.g. maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration's
   temperature dependency of vegetation) also have significant effects.
   Parameter values are constrained by observation, and we found that the
   CO2 emission data had a significant effect in constraining climate
   sensitivity and the magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing.},

   understanding different classes of problem},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {9-13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Economic intensification continues to increase along many of the world's
   coastlines. This intensification, which includes asset and
   infrastructure intensification, along with the increasing likelihood of
   inundation associated with sea level rise, implies an increasing risk
   profile for many coastal communities. In response, many cities and
   owners of major civil infrastructure have commissioned climate risk and
   adaptation studies in order to develop adaptation strategies. In many
   cases the same methods, terminology and approaches have been applied in
   studies of adaptation options for entire communities as for individual
   structures and assets. It is argued here that as a result of the
   different scales and complexity between whole communities and individual
   assets or structures, it is desirable that tailored approaches to
   identifying adaptation options need to be applied. In particular, it is
   recommended that categorising settlement and infrastructure studies into
   either community-scale, or infrastructure-scale problems will help to
   ensure that the most appropriate methodological approaches are be used.

Abstract = {Around the world, deltaic and coastal regions like the Netherlands are
   facing challenges from climate, change such as sea-level rise as well as
   more frequent and extreme natural events. Since 2009, the Dutch
   government has tried to mitigate flood vulnerability by deploying a
   balanced mix of flood protection measures, resilient spatial planning
   and crisis management (MultiLayer Safety). However, recent evaluations
   have concluded that resilient spatial planning is (too) limitedly
   applied in practice. This article aims to understand the barriers and
   opportunities for resilient spatial planning in flood risk management by
   comparing two cases where resilient spatial planning was opted for:
   Dordrecht and the Ussel-Vecht Delta. The study suggests a large gap
   between the wide array of possible measures, and those that are actually
   realized in practice. Three physical-spatial barriers were identified:
   maximum flood depths, lack of space, and rigidity of the existing built
   environment. Additionally, institutional-organizational barriers were
   found, including: a false, low or non-existent safety perception or risk
   awareness, and therefore a lack of urgency to act; a lack of political
   and societal support; a suboptimal collaboration between stakeholders;
   ambiguity regarding responsibilities; finances and a cost-benefit
   imbalance; and a lack of human capital. Subsequently, the article
   explores possibilities to overcome these barriers. Overcoming these
   barriers can pave pathways for flood resilient spatial planning. The
   institutional-organizational barriers appear surmountable, whereas the
   physical-spatial barriers prove to be more problematic and form the most
   important restrictive factor for resilient spatial planning in flood
   risk management.},

Abstract = {Different individuals and groups perceive risk differently. This can
   significantly affect risk management and mitigation practices and
   requirements. This paper presents findings from a study of tropical
   cyclone risk perceptions in the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory
   of Australia. Primary in-depth interview data and other secondary data
   are analysed, focussing in particular on wind damage, storm surge and
   life safety risk perceptions of residents since Cyclone Tracy, which
   impacted in 1974, and perceptions of future climate change as it relates
   to tropical cyclone risk. The analysis reveals that a number of
   perceptions prevail. In particular, the study reveals a wide difference
   of perceptions between short-term residents (Group 1) and long-term and
   expert residents (Group 2) in relation to wind damage, storm surge and
   life safety risk. It also reveals a large division between laypersons
   (Group 3) and expert residents' (Group 4) perceptions of climate change
   risk as it relates to tropical cyclone risk. The author recommends that
   flexible, multiple and integrative management and mitigation approaches
   are required to deal with such different perceptions and divisions in
   the resident population.},

Title = {Implementing ecosystem-based management: evolution or revolution?},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {465-476},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a dominant paradigm, ecosystem-based fisheries have to come to terms
   with uncertainty and complexity, an interdisciplinary visioning of
   management objectives, and putting humans back into the ecosystem. The
   goal of this article is to suggest that implementing ecosystem-based
   management (EBM) has to be revolutionary in the sense of going beyond
   conventional practices. It would require the use of multiple disciplines
   and multiple objectives, dealing with technically unresolvable
   management problems of complex adaptive systems and expanding scope from
   management to governance. Developing the governance toolbox would
   require expanding into new kinds of interaction unforeseen by the
   mid-twentieth-century fathers of fishery science governance that may
   involve cooperative, multilevel management, partnerships, social
   learning and knowledge co-production. In addition to incorporating
   relatively well-known resilience, adaptive management and co-management
   approaches, taking EBM to the next stage may include some of the
   following: conceptualizing EBM as a wicked problem; conceptualizing
   fisheries as social-ecological systems; picking and choosing from an
   assortment of new governance approaches; and finding creative ways to
   handle complexity.},

Title = {Assessment of shallow landslide risk mitigation measures based on land

Journal = {LANDSLIDES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {On October 25, 2011, an extreme rainfall event affected a wide area
   along the coasts of Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, northern Italy).
   Particularly, in the Vernazza catchment, the event triggered hundreds of
   shallow landslides and a debris flood that caused three casualties.
   Investigation of the slope stability after the event was carried out
   aiming at defining the most effective mitigation measures which may be
   adopted in future land use planning. To this objective, a susceptibility
   model was produced and a series of scenarios were simulated using
   probabilistic methods. The susceptibility model has provided information
   about landslide conditioning factors on which to act for reducing
   landslide occurrence and therefore the associated risk. The simulations
   have taken into consideration the following alternative types of
   mitigation measures: (1) restoration of abandoned terraces, (2)
   reforestation of abandoned terraces, (3) use of local structural
   measures over stretches of potentially unstable hillsides and (4)
   avoidance of any intervention. The advantages and the disadvantages of
   the proposed mitigation measures for shallow landslide risk are
   discussed considering the results of the simulations and taking into
   account their complex interaction with environmental, historical,
   cultural and socio-economic aspects. The results show that the most
   effective mitigation strategy for reducing landslide risk at short term
   consists of applying structural measures over potentially unstable
   slopes. However, a long-term programme promoting the development of
   agricultural or forestry practices on terraced slopes is necessary. In
   fact, the simulations indicate that if no measures are applied to avoid
   the degradation of the terraced areas, landslide areal frequency would
   inevitably increase.},

Abstract = {Small community businesses bear the brunt of climate change impacts.
   Studies of the vulnerability and resilience of such businesses
   predominantly focus on firm-level characteristics and organizational
   issues. This paper addresses the lack of individual-level
   considerations. It explores an analytical approach that draws upon the
   concepts of social capital and sense of place for understanding
   community businesses' resilience to extreme weather. An empirical study
   was conducted to investigate whether and how the attributes of these
   concepts are related to adaptation practice. This study is based on a
   structured questionnaire survey of community businesses at various
   locations around the Pearl River Estuary that are exposed to storm
   surges. The findings partially support the hypothesis that action is
   more likely to be taken when social capital is strong. Community
   businesses are more likely to adopt adaptation strategies when their
   owners or operators perceive a higher level of social expectation, but
   are less likely to do so when they have better relationships with the
   people around them. This study indicated the potential for moral hazard
   driven by good social relationships and supported the understanding of
   small community businesses as firms and social agents in responding to
   climate change impacts. There is a need for recognizing the social
   dimensions of small businesses' rationality in their adaptation and
   hazard adjustment, and strengthening their engagement with
   community-based adaptation through social institutions.},

Title = {Firms adaptation to climate change through product innovation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {350},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Climate change will impose high costs on different societal actors,
   including firms and organizations, forcing them to adapt to this new
   situation. Although the relevance of implementing adaptation strategies
   is widely recognized, studies on firms' adaptation to climate change are
   still in their infancy, especially regarding small and medium
   enterprises. Following a multi-stage approach, we analyze how small and
   medium enterprises in the marine food industry could adapt to
   climate-induced ocean acidification through product innovation. First,
   we use a co-production process with the firms' representatives to gain
   insights into the industry's adaptation opportunities, in which product
   innovation arises as the preferred strategy. Second, using a Discrete
   Choice Experiment, we test if consumers value both the mussels'
   attributes likely affected by ocean acidification (sensory and
   nutritional) and the proposed new products developed to adapt to it. We
   also analyze preferences' heterogeneity through a latent class model.
   Our results show that consumers value the attributes potentially
   affected by ocean acidification. We found high heterogeneity in consumer
   preferences regarding product types, disentangled into two classes
   (non-innovative consumers and consumers willing to innovate). We suggest
   that the industry could base its adaptation strategy on two pillars: 1)
   maintain the traditional format, thus satisfying 21\% of the market
   (non-innovative consumers); 2) direct the innovation efforts towards the
   canned format, thus satisfying those consumers willing to innovate (79\%
   of the market). Although consumers willing to innovate are prone to try
   new formats, the preferred alternatives are not radical innovations.},

   chapter covers the implications of climate change for planning, mostly
   as hazards expected to occur along coasts. The chapter also briefly
   mentions other types of hazards, not directly related to climate change,
   such as tsunamis. Mitigation and adaptation are two different strategies
   that planners use in confronting climate change. Mitigation refers to
   tackling the causes. Adaptation refers to coping with consequences and
   is the main approach in which planners will be involved. Adaptation
   policies should be appropriate to the context, guiding planners towards
   the achievement of multiple objectives, some of which need to be
   achieved regardless of the impacts of climate change.},

Title = {Influence of urban resilience measures in the magnitude and behaviour of

   scenario},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Different urban resilience measures, such as the increase of urban green
   areas and the application of white roofs, were evaluated with the
   WRF-SUEWS modelling system. The case study consists of five heat waves
   occurring in Porto (Portugal) urban area in a future climate scenario.
   Meteorological forcing and boundary data were downscaled for Porto urban
   area from the CMIP5 earth system model MPI-ESM, for the Representative
   Concentration Pathway RCP8.5 scenario. The influence of different
   resilience measures on the energy balance components was quantified and
   compared between each other. Results show that the inclusion of green
   urban areas increases the evaporation and the availability of surface
   moisture, redirecting the energy to the form of latent heat flux
   (maximum increase of +200 W m(-2)) rather than to sensible heat. The
   application of white roofs increases the solar radiation reflection, due
   to the higher albedo of such surfaces, reducing both sensible and
   storage heat flux (maximumreductions of -62.8 and -35 W m(-2),
   respectively). The conjugations of the individual benefits related to
   each resilience measure shows that this measure is the most effective
   one in terms of improving the thermal comfort of the urban population,
   particularly due to the reduction of both sensible and storage heat
   flux. The obtained results contribute to the knowledge of the
   surface-atmosphere exchanges and can be of great importance for
   stakeholders and decision-makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The United States Forest Service, a federal agency entrusted with
   managing 78 M hectares of national forestlands under a broad
   multiple-use mandate, has seen recent shifts in policy direction
   emphasizing ecological restoration, consideration of climate change
   impacts, and a focus on managing for resilient landscapes. The process
   of revising the comprehensive plans guiding national forest management
   presents opportunities to reorient objectives, activities, and
   commitments toward these goals. Here we analyze case studies of three
   national forests that have completed the forest plan revision process
   since 2014: the Francis Marion National Forest in coastal South
   Carolina, the Kaibab National Forest in northern Arizona, and the Rio
   Grande National Forest in southern Colorado. We analyze plan revision
   participants' perspectives on the opportunities and barriers to
   reorienting national forest management toward resilient landscapes and
   the broader political, social, and institutional factors that influence
   these dynamics. Key opportunities included better promoting resilient
   landscape objectives by revising fire management guidelines,
   incorporating scientific data and modeling from multiple agency and
   non-agency partners, and building opportunities for adaptive management
   via long-term trust networks. Major barriers included inconsistent
   higher-level support for resilience objectives, an emphasis on meeting
   narrow quantitative performance targets, and under-investments in
   monitoring.},

   in Iberian Coastal Cities},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Iberian coastal cities are subject to significant risks in the next
   decades due to climate change-induced sea-level rise. These risks are
   quite uncertain depending on several factors. In this article, we
   estimate potential economic damage in 62 Iberian coastal cities from
   2020 to 2100 using regional relative sea-level rise data under three
   representative concentration pathways (RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6). We
   analyze the expected accumulated damage costs if no adaptation actions
   take place and compare this scenario to the investment cost of some
   adaptation strategies being implemented. The results show that some
   adaptation strategies are less costly than the potential damage under
   inaction. In other words, it is economically rational to invest in
   adaptation even in a context of high uncertainty. These calculations are
   very relevant to inform climate change adaptation decisions and to
   better manage the risk posed by sea-level rise. Moreover, our findings
   show the importance of a good understanding of the shape of the
   sea-level rise and damage cost distributions to calculate the expected
   damage. We show that using the 50th percentile for these calculations is
   not adequate as it leads to a serious underestimation of expected damage
   and coastal risk.},

Title = {Adapt, move or surrender? Manufacturing firms' routines and dynamic
   capabilities on flood risk reduction in coastal cities of Indonesia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {332-342},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many manufacturing firms collocate within coastal urban areas in
   Indonesia. At these locations, they are severely affected by the most
   occurring environmental hazard, floods. Although research on firms'
   adaptation to environmental hazards is burgeoning, the focus still lies
   on damage evaluation, support for disaster relief, or on how firms can
   support the community. Despite the fact that floods are a recurrent and
   aggravating stressor for firms, particularly in developing countries, a
   clear understanding of how firms develop adaptation strategies and which
   rationales determine their strategy has been sparsely addressed.
   Therefore, this paper derives flood adaptation strategies from the
   literature and empirically test them on flood-prone manufacturing firms
   in Jakarta and Semarang. Based on 67 in-depth interviews, we demonstrate
   that firms' routines (i.e., behavioral pattern) and dynamic capabilities
   (i.e., competencies) determine the adaptation strategies of
   manufacturing firms in Jakarta and Semarang. The study shows that firms'
   flood adaptation strategies differ regarding business size and between
   both cities. Particularly, it is detected that large and medium-sized
   firms can adapt more effectively to floods, while small firms face
   difficulties due to inferior routines and dynamic capabilities. This
   shortcoming jeopardizes their general business viability. Overall, the
   paper emphasizes the imperative for a deeper understanding of firms'
   adaptation strategies since viable firms are an essential player to
   strengthen the social welfare, economic development, and ecological
   conservation in flood-prone areas.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {374-390},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation is essential for coastal areas. This paper
   adds to the limited evidence on the trade-offs people are willing to
   make concerning coastal adaptation strategies along an entire coast of a
   state (Baltic Sea coast of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). The
   trade-offs are conceptualised in a choice experiment in terms of six
   attributes: the extent of beach nourishment, dyke heightening, cliff
   protection, access to dunes, realignment of dykes and dunes, and cost in
   terms of a coastal protection levy. The attributes were selected and
   designed in close cooperation, among others, with governmental
   decision-makers. Accounting for preference heterogeneity, we identified
   three latent groups among the participants of a nationwide online survey
   in Germany. Respondents who prefer extensive changes, respondents who
   are willing to pay only for an increase in dyke height, and respondents
   who are unwilling to cover additional expenses for adaptation. The
   aggregated welfare measures indicate that an adaptation scenario
   Recreation ranks highest followed by Safety and Nature. However, the
   scenarios do not represent unequivocal alternatives and provide
   essential insights into peoples' preferences not only to policymakers
   and the administration in the case study region.},

Abstract = {Asian Mega deltas (AMDs) are among the world ` s most important
   rice-growing areas and vital for food security. This review describes
   the major environmental and agricultural characteristics as well as
   current and future threats to food production and livelihood, using
   three AMDs as examples, namely the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta in
   Bangladesh, the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar and the Mekong River delta
   in Vietnam. In addition, we analysed the most widely used agricultural
   adaptation methods in these areas. The major threat to agriculture is
   salinity intrusion and water scarcity, which consequently leads to a
   shortage of irrigation water and yield reduction. The most common
   applied agricultural adaptation strategies are the use of salt-tolerant
   varieties and the adjustment of cropping calendars, as well as the use
   of water-saving technologies. It was found that there are many concepts
   that address individual problems, but a comprehensive and integrated
   concept for delta regions to adapt to climate change is still missing.},

Title = {Adaptation thresholds and pathways for tidal flood risk management in
   London},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {42-58},
Abstract = {Protecting the UK's capital city from global mean sea level rise that
   the IPCC considers plausible over the next centuries would require a
   combination of a new tidal barrier, high volume pumping and incremental
   raising of the system of flood walls and embankments. Using a risk and
   decision analysis methodology that is transferable to other vulnerable
   coastal cities of high strategic economic and political importance, we
   quantify sequences of adaptations that would be needed to protect London
   from flooding by the sea to the year 2300. Two critical adaptation
   thresholds are identified: (i) when mechanical pumping has to be
   provided alongside the moveable tidal barrier in order to drain the
   River Thames and (ii) when a permanently closed barrier with pumping to
   remove all of the river flow becomes the only viable means of avoiding
   flooding. We test the sensitivity of the costs and benefits of
   alternative adaptation pathways to a wide range of sea level rise
   trajectories. The adaptation pathway that most cost-effectively and
   robustly maintains risk at a tolerable level involves moving the Thames
   Barrier 17 km towards the sea if mean sea level rises 2 m above present
   levels. Our methodology provides a quantitative risk-based
   implementation of an adaptation pathway.},

Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NbS) present an opportunity to reduce rising
   temperatures and the urban heat island effect. A multi-scale study in
   Toronto, Ontario, Canada, evaluates the effect of NbS on air and land
   surface temperature through two field campaigns at the micro and meso
   scales, using in situ measurements and LANDSAT imagery. This research
   demonstrates that the application of NbS in the form of green
   infrastructure has a beneficial impact on urban climate regimes with
   measurable reductions in air and land surface temperatures. Broad
   implementation of green infrastructure is a sustainable solution to
   improve the urban climate, enhance heat and greenspace equity, and
   increase resilience.},

Abstract = {There is increasing concern over the consequences of global warming for
   the food security and livelihoods of the world's 36 million fisherfolk
   and the nearly 1.5 billion consumers who rely oil fish for more than
   20\% of their dietary animal protein. With mounting evidence of the
   impacts of climate variability and change oil aquatic ecosystems, the
   resulting impacts oil fisheries livelihoods are likely to be
   significant, but remain a neglected area in climate adaptation policy.
   Drawing upon our research and the available literature, and using a
   livelihoods framework, this paper synthesizes the pathways through which
   climate variability and change impact fisherfolk livelihoods at the
   household and community level. We identify current and potential
   adaptation strategies and explore the wider implications for local
   livelihoods, fisheries management and climate policies. Responses to
   climate change can be anticipatory or reactive and should include: (1)
   management approaches and policies that build the livelihood asset base,
   reducing vulnerability to multiple stressors, including climate change;
   (2) an understanding of current response mechanisms to climate
   variability and other shocks in order to inform planned adaptation; (3)
   a recognition of the opportunities that climate change could bring to
   the sector; (4) adaptive strategies designed with a multi-sector
   perspective; and (5) a recognition of fisheries potential contribution
   to mitigation efforts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change is already impacting marine ecosystems. To adequately
   assess the threats and opportunities created we need modelling
   frameworks capable of evaluating the transfer of climate signals from
   the atmosphere to the oceans, and its propagation through to fish and
   fisheries. Significant progress has been achieved in developing such
   models. However, they seldom incorporate human activity in their
   projections, and thus ignore its capacity to amplify or minimise climate
   impacts. Emerging models exploring the synergistic dual exposure of
   marine ecosystems to climate change and human activity demonstrate
   firstly the explicit inclusion of humans is essential to provide
   meaningful and realistic climate change projections, and secondly
   effective tools for adaptation and mitigation strategies cannot be
   developed in their absence. The challenge is thus to develop coupled
   modelling frameworks that allow society to investigate the trade-offs
   between adaptation and mitigation in the management of marine
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {This paper examines barriers and opportunities for climate change
   adaptation in an urban coastal setting where adaptation is in its
   infancy. It draws on a diagnostic framework as a foundation for
   identifying and organising barriers and opportunities in terms of three
   broad phases of the adaptation process, i.e. (1) understanding the
   problem, (2) planning adaptation options and (3) managing implementation
   of such options. Data come from the analysis of documents (e.g. policy,
   plans and reports) and a survey of 49 representatives from 42
   organisations (e.g. government, environmental non-governmental
   organisations, businesses and local industry and professional
   associations). Nineteen barriers and/or opportunities pertaining to the
   different phases of the adaptation process were identified. Three of
   those barriers (i.e. competing priorities, existing management context
   and existing ecological context) are our additions to the initial list
   of common barriers proposed in the diagnostic framework. Barriers
   pertaining to the understanding phase were the most frequently noted by
   respondents. The understanding phase was also one which most of the
   barriers were nevertheless considered as opportunities. Emerging
   critical barriers and/or opportunities for climate change adaptation
   included perception of signal, availability and accessibility of
   information, existing management context and leadership. We propose that
   addressing these barriers and opportunities would involve improving
   perception about climate change and availability and accessibility of
   information, fostering anticipatory planned adaptation through the
   existing management context and developing leadership for adaptation.
   Findings from this study may prove useful to other jurisdictions,
   particularly those where climate adaptation is at its early stages of
   development.},

Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper identified the research focus and development tendency of
   urban planning and climate change research from 1990 to 2016 using
   CiteSpace, which is based on the Web of Science database. Through
   cluster analysis and a document sorting method, the research direction
   of city planning and climate change were mainly divided into four
   academic groupings, 15 clusters with homogenous themes representing the
   current research focus direction at the sub-level. The detailed study on
   the framework presented three mainstream developing directions: (1) The
   index assessment and spatial simulation on the impact of urban spatial
   systems for climate change have become important methods to identify and
   improve the adaptability of urban space. (2) Adaptive governance as a
   bottom-up strategy giving priority to institutional adaptation policy
   and collaborative polices for responding to climate change has become
   the hot direction in recent years. (3) The policies of urban public
   health-related urban equity, vulnerability, and environmental
   sustainability were addressed especially during the period from 2007 to
   2009. Dynamic evolution trends of the research field were discussed: (1)
   The total numbers of papers in this field increased distinctly between
   2005 and 2008, research focus shifted from single-dimension to
   multi-dimension comprehensive studies, and the humanism tendency was
   obvious. (2) After 2010, research on multi-level governance and spatial
   adaptation strategies became the key issues, and a bottom-up level
   adaptation policies were addressed. Finally, the critical influence of
   the important literature and the forefront issues of the research field
   were put forward.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of climate change on the decision of
   farmers to engage or not to engage in livestock activities and also on
   the choice of different livestock species in Kenya. To this end,
   cross-sectional household level data supplemented by long-term averages
   of climate data are used. The probit model is employed to derive the
   response of the probability of engaging in livestock activities to
   climate change. Probit and multivariate probit methods are employed to
   model the choice of different livestock species. Atmosphere-ocean global
   circulation models are used to project the impact of different climate
   scenarios on the probability of engaging in livestock activities and
   also of adopting different livestock species according to variations in
   climate. The results suggest that farmers adapt livestock management
   decisions to climate change. At low levels of temperature increase, the
   probability of engaging in livestock activities falls, but at higher
   levels of climate change, the probability rises. The results further
   show that as it gets hotter, farmers change their livestock choices from
   dairy cattle and sheep to beef cattle and goats.},

   highest percentage of exposed population. In this study, we employ a
   contingent valuation method to explore residents' willingness to pay for
   sea level rise mitigation policies in Rio de Janeiro. Given the high
   level of perceived corruption in the state, we also examine whether
   residents would prefer mitigation efforts be managed by the state
   government or a more diversified coalition of community stakeholders.
   Our findings indicate that residents are not willing to pay additional
   property taxes to fund sea level rise mitigation policies, unless
   policymakers are transparent with the use of these funds.},

Abstract = {While climate change is a global phenomenon, adaptive action starts at
   the local level. Understanding how local decision makers make sense of
   climate change and the decision to adapt or not is imperative for
   advancing action on climate change. This article advances the
   scholarship on local decision making about adaptive action through a
   study of North Carolina (NC) coastal communities that face an assortment
   of threats from climate change. During March and April of 2014, 283
   officials were surveyed across the 20 NC coastal counties to explore
   their willingness to take adaptive action (WTAA). The study utilized
   five risk scenarios to probe officials' knowledge about climate change,
   whether they perceived climate change as a threat to their community,
   and their political ideology. Findings indicated an officials' professed
   knowledge of climate change was not associated with WTAA. Officials who
   perceived climate change as a threat to their community were largely
   more WTAA. However, when the perceived threat was identified as
   uncertain, no significant relationships were identified. Findings for
   political ideology and WTAA indicated no significant differences under a
   low level of risk, yet under an average level of risk and an uncertain
   level of risk moderates were more WTAA than conservatives. Under higher
   than average and very high levels of risk moderates were more WTAA than
   both liberals and conservatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Lessons of local-scale climate change adaptations through indigenous
   techniques and knowledge practices (ITKPs) are imperative for climate
   adaptation policies. This study focused on the benefits of ITKPs and the
   potential of integrating them into climate adaptation and development
   activities through focus group discussions (FGDs) (n = 4) (involving
   persons over 18 years old, had recent disaster experience, and had lived
   at least 12 years in the area) and household surveys (n = 130) in the
   southern coastal areas of Bangladesh. We used household surveys to
   examine the importance of the ITKPs in terms of livelihood development
   and climate change adaptations, and qualitative syntheses of the FGDs
   information to reveal the causality of the ITKPs and development
   activities. Our study revealed that households perceived ITKPs to have
   higher economic security (64\%), livelihood risk reduction (75\%) and
   food security (62\%). The majority of households (70\%) in the
   agriculture profession perceived the higher economic potential of ITKPs,
   depending on the climate-adaptive co-benefits and taking into account
   their dependencies on climatic events. Agriculture dependent households
   who perceived the higher benefits of ITKPs were willing to pay 300
   BDT/person/year for the improvement and restoration of those in the
   study areas. Our proposed DPSIR (driver, pressure, state, impact and
   response) framework implies the potentials of the incorporation of ITKPs
   into the national climate change adaptation policy in order to ensure
   sustainable climate change adaption for the coastal community of
   Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Climate change will increase the intensity, duration and/or frequency of
   some climate-related hazards. Responsibility for adapting to such
   impacts of climate change in Australia has, in the main, fallen on local
   governments which have paid varying degrees of attention to the issue.
   This paper takes an integrated approach to compare the climate
   adaptation and disaster resilience policies and plans of local
   governments of two low-lying coastal cities in Australia to understand
   whether (and how) local governments can make a difference. The findings
   indicate that local governments can significantly contribute to building
   resilience and adapting to climate-related hazards, however a number of
   factors such as the attitudes of local governments on climate change,
   environmental activism, and the recent experiences of climate-related
   disasters are instrumental for shaping a better local response. Local
   action also needs to be supported by a more integrated approach by all
   levels of government.},

Abstract = {Wild sentient species (primarily vertebrates), both introduced and
   indigenous, are managed for a range of reasons and often using lethal
   methods. Use of these tools often raises ethical challenges and
   uncertainty for wildlife managers, and when combined with ecological and
   economic uncertainties, pest control programs can fail because these
   uncertainties are not fully evaluated or accounted for in program plans.
   Bryan Norton has frequently stated that environmental management
   problems are often ``wicked{''} problems, and participants in the debate
   bring with them a wide range of values and vocabularies. He and others
   have suggested that such problems might best be solved within a
   framework of pragmatism implemented through an empirically based,
   multi-criteria adaptive management system. In this chapter, we propose
   the adoption of a probabilistic modelling approach that could help
   wildlife managers frame and formalize an adaptive management approach
   that integrates the 3Es: ecology, economics, and ethics, one that
   maximizes the probability of achieving sustainable and effective
   wildlife management outcomes.},

Abstract = {Heat Waves and extreme heat are frequently not considered to be severe
   or adverse weather conditions. However, they are the leading cause of
   weather-related fatalities throughout the world. The misconception of
   heat is often due to the lack of visual evidence caused by destruction
   or risk, a commonly reported metric for hurricanes or similar forces.
   Heat Waves can be visualized through the Urban Heat Island, a phenomenon
   which exaggerates thermal impact within the built environment. This
   chapter explores and describes the Extreme Heat Vulnerability Index
   (EHVI), a local-area model designed for advance warning and mitigation
   practices related to extreme heat and socioeconomically vulnerable
   neighborhoods, through example data from Chicago, IL. The disadvantages
   and shortcomings of previous weather warnings are discussed, as well as
   how better vulnerability models can improve mitigation strategies to
   reduce loss of life and improve resource management. Mitigation
   practices from Chicago, Phoenix, Arizona, and other cities will be
   discussed to provide examples of the benefit of implementing
   vulnerability warnings.},

Title = {Evaluating economic costs and benefits of climate resilient livelihood
   strategies},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {115-129},
Abstract = {A major challenge for international development is to assist the poorest
   regions to achieve development targets while taking climate change into
   account. Such `climate resilient development' (CRD) must identify and
   implement adaptation strategies for improving livelihoods while also
   being cost-effective. While the idea that climate resilience and
   development goals should be compatible is often discussed, empirical
   evaluations of the economic impacts of actual CRD investments are
   practically non-existent. This paper outlines a framework to evaluate
   economic returns to CRD and applies it in two adaptation strategies
   trialed in Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, eastern Indonesia. The
   evaluation framework is composed of three models: a household benefit
   cost model, a diffusion model, and a regional benefit cost model. The
   models draw upon the impact evaluation, technology diffusion, and risk
   assessment literatures, respectively. The analyzes are based on expert
   opinion and locally-derived information, and hence can be applied in
   data-poor situations typical of developing countries. Our results
   explore economic costs and benefits at the household and regional scale,
   and we identify key input variables that greatly influence the economic
   returns of the strategies. These variables should therefore be a focus
   of ongoing investment. We also discuss how the framework is more
   generally applicable, its limitations including challenges in accounting
   for less tangible social and ecosystem service benefits, potentially
   leading to the underestimation of impacts, and how the approach should
   be complemented by qualitative methods. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Title = {Poor recovery of fungal denitrification limits nitrogen removal capacity
   in a constructed Gulf Coast marsh},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Widespread degradation and destruction of coastal wetlands over the last
   century have spurred on the practice of creating salt marshes to
   mitigate losses of wetland area and ecosystem function. Constructed
   marshes can quickly recover plant biomass, but biogeochemical functions,
   such as nitrogen removal capacity through denitrification, can take
   decades to centuries to recover. One potential mechanism for this
   uncoupling of structural and functional recovery is that an impaired
   microbial community subsequently impedes the nitrogen removal capacity
   of constructed marshes. While both bacteria and fungi can contribute to
   nitrogen removal via denitrification, little is known about fungal
   denitrification in wetlands, even though it has the potential to
   contribute to climate change via the production of the greenhouse gas
   nitrous oxide. Here, we measured fungal and bacterial denitrification
   potential rates and fungal biomass in sediments collected from a
   33-year-old constructed marsh and a reference natural marsh to assess
   both a) the relative contribution of each group to total nitrogen
   removal and b) whether fungal biomass accrual is a driver of functional
   recovery in salt marshes. To assess the relative contributions of fungi
   and bacteria to denitrification, we added selective inhibitors
   (antifungal, antibacterial, or both) to sediments from each marsh and
   measured potential fungal and bacterial denitrification rates. We also
   measured sediment ergosterol concentrations seasonally as a proxy for
   fungal biomass. In the absence of inhibitors, denitrification potential
   rates in the constructed marsh were three times lower than in natural
   marsh sediment. Further, denitrification rates in the constructed marsh
   remained similarly low regardless of increasing inhibitor concentration,
   whereas denitrification rates in the natural marsh declined with
   increasing inhibitor concentration. When either inhibitor was added
   alone, denitrification was stimulated in the natural marsh, but was
   suppressed in the constructed marsh, suggesting an apparent competitive
   release, where the reduction of either bacterial or fungal competition
   for substrate thereby allowed the remaining competitor greater access to
   the substrate, in the natural marsh. We observed that compared to the
   constructed marsh, fungi in the natural marsh contributed similar to
   30\% more (50\% vs. 21\%) to denitrification, and that fungal biomass
   was generally higher. Collectively, these data suggest that 3 decades
   post construction, denitrification rates and the contribution of fungal
   denitrification to total denitrification are lower in the constructed
   marsh than the natural marsh. These data also suggest that fungal
   biomass may limit the recovery of nitrogen removal in constructed
   marshes and that fungal denitrification can be an important pathway of N
   removal in salt marsh ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on both target and
   non-target marine stocks worldwide, with the concomitant need for
   management strategies capable of sustaining fishing in future. We use
   several southern hemisphere fisheries to highlight the likely impacts of
   climate change at a range of levels, from individual to population
   responses, as well as ecosystem ramifications. Examples span polar
   (Antarctic krill fishery), temperate (west coast pelagic fishery,
   abalone and rock lobster), and tropical (Torres Strait rock lobster)
   commercially important fisheries. Responses of these fisheries to either
   past observed environmental changes or projected future changes are used
   to deduce some anticipated implications of climate change for fisheries
   management, including economic impacts and governance considerations. We
   evaluate the effectiveness of current single-species assessment models,
   management strategy evaluation approaches and multispecies assessment
   models as future management tools to cope with likely climate-related
   changes. Non-spatial stock assessment models will have limited ability
   to separate fishery effects from the impacts of climate change.
   Anthropogenic climate change is occurring at a time-scale relevant to
   current fisheries management strategic planning and testing. Adaptive
   management frameworks (with their feedback loops) are ideal for
   detecting and adapting to changes in target stocks.},

Title = {Adaptive Flood Risk Management Under Climate Change Uncertainty Using
   Real Options and Optimization},
Journal = {RISK ANALYSIS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-92},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is well recognized that adaptive and flexible flood risk strategies
   are required to account for future uncertainties. Development of such
   strategies is, however, a challenge. Climate change alone is a
   significant complication, but, in addition, complexities exist trying to
   identify the most appropriate set of mitigation measures, or
   interventions. There are a range of economic and environmental
   performance measures that require consideration, and the spatial and
   temporal aspects of evaluating the performance of these is complex. All
   these elements pose severe difficulties to decisionmakers. This article
   describes a decision support methodology that has the capability to
   assess the most appropriate set of interventions to make in a flood
   system and the opportune time to make these interventions, given the
   future uncertainties. The flood risk strategies have been explicitly
   designed to allow for flexible adaptive measures by capturing the
   concepts of real options and multiobjective optimization to evaluate
   potential flood risk management opportunities. A state-of-the-art flood
   risk analysis tool is employed to evaluate the risk associated to each
   strategy over future points in time and a multiobjective genetic
   algorithm is utilized to search for the optimal adaptive strategies. The
   modeling system has been applied to a reach on the Thames Estuary
   (London, England), and initial results show the inclusion of flexibility
   is advantageous, while the outputs provide decisionmakers with
   supplementary knowledge that previously has not been considered.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes local stakeholders' perception of the effects of,
   and vulnerability to, climate change in the case of the Ebro delta (NW
   Mediterranean Sea). The specific survey carried out amongst relevant
   local stakeholders showed a high level of concern about the current and
   future effects of climate change on the physical and socio-economic
   structures of the Ebro delta. The results of the survey also showed that
   there is a general agreement on the lack of social and political
   awareness of the problems that climate change can create in the delta in
   the near future, as well as a lack of adaptation strategies (only
   suggested or already being implemented). Finally, the conclusions of the
   study mainly rely on the different adaptation strategies proposed by
   previous studies. If any of these strategies is to be developed, there
   is a clear need for a firm will - from the local, regional and national
   political authorities and stakeholders - that should allow the
   development of a new manner of governance that until now it has not been
   possible to develop in the Ebro delta.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation Priority Strategies in the Philippines:
   Differences Between Local Government Decision Makers and Marginalized
   Coastal Communities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Consequences of climate inaction are already felt by many vulnerable
   populations, and adapting to these impacts is an increasingly important
   necessity for affected communities. This study assessed adaptation
   priority differences in the Philippines to determine if traditional
   climate change decision makers accurately represent the marginalized
   communities they serve. Specifically, this study gathered baseline data
   of climate change knowledge, compared resiliency priorities and proposed
   strategies between local government workers and village residents, and
   analyzed factors that contribute to identify differences. The study's
   target group (residents of small villages) has historically been
   marginalized in municipal environmental decision making. Data collected
   through focus group discussions and interviews demonstrated there was a
   statistical difference between local government officials who were more
   likely to propose abstract, systemic adaptation strategies to build
   social capacity (69\% of government officials' proposed strategies),
   while village residents focused on physical infrastructure (59\% of
   village residents' proposed strategies). A second study outcome was the
   identification of contributing factors in how Filipinos might propose
   climate change adaptation strategies: for example, education levels,
   social or economic class, accessibility to resources, sources of
   information, and past experience with hazards. The significance of this
   research is the evidence of climate change adaptation prioritization
   differences between the country's traditional decision-making group, the
   municipal government unit, and marginalized members of local villages.
   The differences show that local municipal government units in the
   Philippines may not be the most effective base group for bottom-up
   adaptation and support the need for effective collaboration and
   community engagement in future climate change planning.},

Abstract = {The ocean plays a major role in regulating Earth's climate system, and
   is highly vulnerable to climate change, but continues to receive little
   attention in the ongoing policymaking designed to mitigate and adapt to
   global climate change. There are numerous ways to consider the ocean
   more significantly when developing these policies, several of which
   offer the co-benefits of biodiversity protection and support of
   marine-dependent human communities. When developing forward-thinking
   climate change policy, it is important to understand the ways that the
   ocean contributes to global climate and to fully inventory the services
   that the ocean provides to humans. Without more inclusive consideration
   of the ocean in climate policy, at all levels of governance, policy
   makers risk weaker than necessary mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Participatory Approach to Build Up a Municipal Strategy for Coastal
   Erosion Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Ovar coastline is characterized as one of the coastal areas with the
   highest vulnerability and risk of erosion in the Portuguese coast. The
   high-energy coast is further threatened by a permanent sediment deficit
   of anthropic origin, as well as sea level rise due to climate change. It
   is essential to define modern coastal adaptation strategies to minimize
   the impacts of these issues on the local communities, while considering
   social, environmental, and economic factors. It is in this territory
   that the INCCA project's case study is located, involving stakeholders
   with technical, scientific, and operational knowledge in the
   co-management of the coastal stretch. In the scope of the involvement
   intended for the project's development, five participatory events were
   held, involving local authorities, civil protection, public entities,
   academia, and the general community. These events allowed a
   multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder analysis of the challenges and
   possible solutions to mitigate coastal erosion, representing the
   definition of a shared vision for the coastline's future in this
   municipality. This work presents the main results of this participatory
   process as well as reflections on the importance of active citizenship
   instruments and stakeholder involvement for integrated coastal
   management in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {Studies on the effects of 1.5 degrees C global warming above
   pre-industrial levels, especially in megacities, are very limited. Here,
   we review recent progress in understanding climate change-related
   extreme temperature and precipitation events in China's megacities, and
   provide some potential options for adaptation. Studies have indicated
   that both global warming and urbanization could strengthen heatwave and
   extreme precipitation events. These extreme events have shown an uptrend
   in China's megacities and are projected to further increase in the
   future. Notably, the projected intensity of extreme temperature and
   precipitation events in China's three urban agglomerations is lower
   under 1.5 degrees C global warming compared with 2 degrees C.
   Furthermore, adaptation options to cope with the increasing risks of
   extreme weather and climate events are crucial for megacities due to the
   combined effects of global warming and urbanization.},

Title = {Addressing Climate Change Impacts and Resiliency in Contaminated Site
   Remediation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts and its resulting vulnerabilities are perhaps one
   of the most important and yet the most poorly understood issues in the
   world today. The contaminated sites, specifically those located by
   coastal and equatorial regions, are at great risk in facing the impacts
   of climate change and extreme weather events, since they are not
   designed considering those in mind. The climate change impacts that
   specifically affect site remediation may include sea-level rise, extreme
   temperatures, extreme precipitation, extreme wind, and wildfires. While
   the efforts toward incorporating sustainability in terms of the
   assessment of net environmental, economic, and social impacts and
   benefits in remediation design and implementation is increasing, the
   remediation approach must incorporate climate change resilience into
   planning, design, execution, operation, and maintenance of the
   remediation strategy. There are a few frameworks published in literature
   that address the incorporation of resiliency and climate change
   adaptation in contaminated site remediation design. This study presents
   an overview of some of these frameworks in the context of the United
   States and its current status quo regarding the environmental
   remediation to aid in resilient design of remediation strategies for the
   cleanup of contaminated sites. Further, a new quantitative approach to
   decision-making involving quantitative life cycle sustainability
   assessment and quantification of uncertainty in evaluating the
   feasibility of climate change adaptation measures for site-specific
   remedial designs is discussed. A few case studies demonstrating the
   current practice of resiliency in remediation design are discussed.
   Finally, challenges to assess and implement sustainable and resilient
   remediation are discussed. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

   coastal flood risks - optimizing success through knowledge co-production},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2879-2890},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions are increasingly suggested for mitigating coastal
   flood risks in the face of climate change. Managed realignment (MR), a
   coastal adaptation strategy that entails the landward realignment of
   coastal defences to restore coastal habitats (often salt marshes), plays
   a pivotal role in implementing nature-based solutions in the coastal
   zone. Across Europe, more than 130 sites have been implemented so far,
   often to harness their potential to mitigate coastal flood risks while
   restoring coastal habitats (ABPmer, 2021). However, local communities
   often oppose MR projects, not only because they are seen as returning
   hard-won land to the sea but also because their coastal protection
   function is less trusted than traditional hard engineering techniques.
   This scepticism has foundation. The proclaimed coastal protection
   function of MRs is based on a broad body of literature on the protective
   function of natural salt marshes. However, contrary to natural salt
   marshes, MRs are often semi-enclosed tidal basins with narrow breaches
   to the open sea/estuary. Recent studies indicate that MR-internal
   hydrodynamics may significantly reduce their coastal protection,
   depending on their engineering design. To successfully implement MR, a
   much-improved scientific knowledge base is needed, as well as a process
   for addressing community concerns and genuinely engaging stakeholders in
   decision-making beyond the usual obligatory consultancy approach. Here,
   we propose the co-production of scientific knowledge with local
   communities and stakeholders to optimize the success of coastal
   nature-based solutions and promote community acceptance.},

Title = {Building Coastal Agricultural Resilience in Bangladesh: A Systematic
   Review of Progress, Gaps and Implications},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review of
   climate change adaptation and resilience in coastal agriculture in
   Bangladesh. It explores the existing adaptation measures against
   climatic stresses. It investigates the extent of resilience-building by
   the use of these adaptation measures and identifies major challenges
   that hinder the adaptation process within the country. The review was
   conducted by following the systematic methods of the protocol of
   Preferred Items for Systematic Review Recommendations (PRISMA) to
   comprehensively synthesize, evaluate and track scientific literature on
   climate-resilient agriculture in coastal Bangladesh. It considered
   peer-reviewed English language articles from the databasesScopus, Web of
   ScienceandScience Directbetween the years 2000 and 2018. A total of 54
   articles were selected following the four major steps of a systematic
   review, i.e., identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion.
   Adaptation measures identified in the review were grouped into different
   themes: Agricultural adaptation, alternative livelihoods, infrastructure
   development, technological advancement, ecosystem management and policy
   development. The review revealed that within the adaptation and
   resilience literature for coastal Bangladesh, maladaptation, gender
   imbalance and the notable absence of studies of island communities were
   gaps that require future research.},

   A Review of Initiatives and Perspectives in the Indian Region},

Abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that South Asian countries including India
   will particularly be vulnerable to climate change impacts. These include
   changes in temperature and rainfall regime, agriculture yields, sea
   level rise, extreme weather events, melting of glaciers, changes in
   ecosystem function, shifts in species distribution etc. Of late some of
   these impacts are being felt with greater frequency in the Indian
   subcontinent e.g. extreme weather events such as cyclones on India's
   eastern coast and droughts in the western states of Rajasthan and
   Gujarat. Serious health related problems are also being attributed to
   climate impacts include outbreaks of vector borne diseases like malaria.
   The present study reviews the various efforts to document and articulate
   people's perceptions and knowledge of the impacts of climate change in
   diverse ecosystems in India. The study analyses the relationship between
   local community knowledge of climate change and the available scientific
   evidence and suggests that people's local knowledge of climate
   indicators conforms to existing scientific data. Effectiveness of
   citizen's initiatives to rapidly document climate change at pan India
   level have also been reviewed. The paper recommends adaptive strategies
   at local, national and regional level for limiting climate change and
   intervention across several sectors for developmental planning. The
   paper also suggests various stake holder based policy measures for
   integration with long term social and technological changes for
   mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate change.},

Title = {Benefits of coastal managed realignment for society: Evidence from
   ecosystem service assessments in two UK regions},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {244},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Coastal managed realignment has the potential to deliver both nature
   conservation and other benefits to people, but these are rarely
   quantified. We used an ecosystem services assessment toolkit, TESSA, at
   two locations in the UK; Hesketh Outmarsh West (northwest England),
   where realignment has already been carried out, and the Inner Firth of
   Forth (central Scotland), where realignment is proposed for multiple
   sites. At the Inner Forth we focus on one site, Inch of Ferryton, in
   Clackmannanshire but also assess ecosystem services across several
   sites. Using dedicated data collection where possible, and site
   appropriate existing data, we estimate the value of these sites to
   people in the realigned state compared with the most realistic
   alternative: continued agricultural production behind hard flood
   defences (agricultural state). Services assessed were climate change
   mitigation, agricultural production, nature-based recreation, and flood
   risk protection. At both sites agricultural production was estimated to
   be greater in the agricultural state, while other services were
   estimated to be greater in the realigned state. We are cautious about
   assigning overall monetary values based on biophysical attributes,
   particularly considering that climate change mitigation is highly
   sensitive to carbon prices, and that by necessity we were unable to
   quantify all services. Nevertheless, using a price for carbon that
   incorporates the societal cost of emissions, we estimate that the net
   annual provision of services is 262,935 (1460.75 pound/ha) at Hesketh
   Outmarsh West and 93,216 pound (574.70 pound/ha) at Inch of Ferryton. At
   both sites, sequestered carbon in accreting sediments outweighs
   greenhouse gas emissions from intertidal habitats, and the net value of
   this in turn outweighs the income foregone from crops and grazing. At
   Hesketh Outmarsh West the value of ecosystem services is increased by
   the reduction to flood risk arising from the coastal managed realignment
   action. Nature-based recreation is estimated to increase at both sites
   under realignment, with the visitor profile expected to be strongly
   local. Decisions about coastal management, including realignment, should
   incorporate information about the ecosystem services provided under
   different scenarios. This applies beyond coastal ecosystems, and the
   site-scale is often the most appropriate scale to carry out such
   assessments, as this is the scale at which decisions are often taken.

Abstract = {Climate change has a significant impact on the environment and is
   expected to increase the frequency and intensity of nature disaster and
   create new hazards (e.g., rise in sea level). As densely populated and
   resource-intensive regions, cities will experience the enhanced heat
   island effect, flooding or water scarcity as a result of extremes in
   rainfall, and severe storms may devastate entire settlements. In the
   face of a projected rise in the frequency and severity of nature
   disasters due to socio-economic developments and climate change the
   question arises of how to adapt to and ameliorate impacts of natural
   disasters. This paper provides some insights into this subject from an
   urban planning perspective and takes a review on the aspects of climate
   change impacts on urban economics, based on the practices of mitigation
   and adaptation experiences, some strategies of adaptation are provided
   and discussed at last.},

Title = {Effects of Climate Finance on Risk Appraisal: A Study in the
   Southwestern Coast of Bangladesh},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Utilising climate funds properly to reduce the impact of potential risks
   of climate change at the local level is essential for successful
   adaptation to climate change. Climate change has been disrupting the
   lives of millions of households along the coastal region of Bangladesh.
   The country has allocated support from its national funds and accessed
   international funds for the implementation of adaptation interventions.
   With the focus of the scientific community on climate finance mechanisms
   and governance at the global and the national level, there is a lacuna
   in empirical evidence of how climate finance affects risk appraisal and
   engagement in adaptation measures at the local level. This paper aims to
   examine how the support from climate finance affects risk appraisal in
   terms of the perceived probability and severity and the factors which
   influence risk appraisal. A field survey was conducted on 240 climate
   finance recipient households (CF HHs) and 120 nonclimate finance
   recipient households (non-CF HHs) in Galachipa Upazila of Patuakhali
   District in coastal Bangladesh. The results indicate that both CF and
   non-CF HHs experience a high probability of facing climatic events in
   the future; however, CF HHs anticipated a higher severity of impacts of
   climatic events on different dimensions of their households. With higher
   income and social capital, the overall risk appraisal decreases for CF
   HHs. CF HHs have higher engagement in adaptation measures and social
   groups and maintain alternative sources of income. Climate finance
   played a critical role in supporting households in understanding the
   risks that they were facing, assisting them in exploring as well as
   enhancing their engagement in adaptation options.},

Title = {Deterioration of oases subject to climate change and coastal
   development: The case of Todos Santos Oasis, Baja California Sur, Mexico},
Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Oases are complex ecosystems, with permanent water bodies, springs, and
   vegetated areas, which are located in areas where the frequency of rain
   is a critical factor for the maintenance and subsistence of flora and
   fauna. These ecosystems have been of great importance providing
   resources for the settlement of human societies. In addition to the
   natural stress to which they are confronted, oases are facing pressures
   related to coastal development and climate change. New research is
   necessary to understand the effects of these pressures, to define
   strategies to promote mitigation measures to limit their deterioration.
   In this paper, we proposed a multi-criteria methodology to define and
   quantify recent and future pressures to an oasis affected by climate
   change and coastal development and the definition of priority areas for
   the installation of mitigation and adaptation measures This methodology
   was applied to Todos Santos oasis, one of the most important wetlands in
   Baja California Sur state, which has been affected in recent years by
   coastal development. The results indicate that the integration of
   MODFLOW models, CCRP index, chemistry data, and geospatial analysis
   provides effective tools to generate information on the possible future
   of oases, contributing greatly to land planning, nature conservation and
   sustainable management of these ecosystems.},

Abstract = {During the last decennium climate change has received much attention and
   especially various mitigation and adaptation strategies have gained
   political awareness. Particularly the coastal zone will be affected by
   derived consequences like sea level rise, increased storminess and
   flooding. In order to mitigate the most severe consequences for the
   society it is decisive that urban and regional planners address the
   climate change issue in their planning efforts. Using modelling and
   simulation, we can increase our understanding of the future land-use
   system under influence of a changing climate and accordingly reduce
   uncertainty concerning decisions. The current paper describes how to
   carry out land-use simulations as envisaged by the SRES narratives using
   a multi-criteria land-use modelling framework. Combined with expected
   future flooding due to sea level rise we perform an impact assessment on
   future urban development. Finally, we describe how the definition of
   adaptation strategies can facilitate spatial planning measures to
   counteract the consequences of potential climate changes. (C) 2010

Title = {Intention of coastal communities to support climate change mitigation
   policies for fish and marine ecosystem preservation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL
   ECONOMY},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to assess the willingness of individuals living
   in coastal communities affected by climate change to financially support
   mitigation policies towards the preservation of marine ecosystems and
   fish resources and to identify the key drivers of their behaviour.
   Design/methodology/approach A survey was carried out involving 994
   people living in three main Italian coastal communities. To investigate
   the main factors affecting Italian coastal communities' willingness to
   pay (WTP) to support climate change mitigation measures to protect the
   marine ecosystem and fishery resources, a Tobit regression model was
   implemented. Findings The results show that these communities are likely
   to pay to safeguard fish resources and the marine ecosystem, owing to
   their social and economic importance for these communities. In
   particular, this study's findings highlight that the individuals'
   attitudes towards climate change, social pressures and their perception
   of the phenomenon play a significant role on their intention to support
   mitigation policies. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that the
   communities most threatened by the negative effects of climate change
   are more willing to contribute financially to protect fish resources and
   the marine ecosystem. Research limitations/implications A limitation is
   related to the adopted methodology. In particular individuals' intention
   to adopt pro-environmental behaviours does not always translate into
   real WTP through additional taxes. Originality/value The value of the
   research stems from its unique collective cross-communal comparison of
   attitudes and intentions, its parallel identification of behavioural
   drivers at the individual level and its prescriptive conclusions of both
   scholarly and practical worth.},

Abstract = {Enhancing species resilience to changing environmental conditions is
   often suggested as a climate change adaptation strategy. To effectively
   achieve this, it is necessary first to understand the factors that
   determine species resilience, and their relative importance in shaping
   the ability of species to adjust to the complexities of environmental
   change. This is an extremely challenging task because it requires
   comprehensive information on species traits. We explored the resilience
   of 58 marine turtle regional management units (RMUs) to climate change,
   encompassing all seven species of marine turtles worldwide. We used
   expert opinion from the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group (n=33
   respondents) to develop a Resilience Index, which considered qualitative
   characteristics of each RMU (relative population size, rookery
   vulnerability, and genetic diversity) and non climate-related threats
   (fisheries, take, coastal development, and pollution/pathogens). Our
   expert panel perceived rookery vulnerability (the likelihood of
   functional rookeries becoming extirpated) and non climate-related
   threats as having the greatest influence on resilience of RMUs to
   climate change. We identified the world's 13 least resilient marine
   turtle RMUs to climate change, which are distributed within all three
   major ocean basins and include six of the world's seven species of
   marine turtle. Our study provides the first look at inter- and
   intra-species variation in resilience to climate change and highlights
   the need to devise metrics that measure resilience directly. We suggest
   that this approach can be widely used to help prioritize future actions
   that increase species resilience to climate change.},

Title = {A Communication-Less Multimode Control Approach for Adaptive Power
   Sharing in Ship-Based Seaport Microgrid},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
   together with the continued depletion of fossil fuels in general has
   encouraged an increase in the use of energy storage systems and
   renewable energy sources at seaports and also on short route yachts and
   ferries. At present, most seaports, particularly smaller ones, are not
   provided with cold-ironing facilities-shore-based power facilities,
   which provide electric power to ships from the national grid. Because of
   the lack of cold-ironing facilities at most ports, auxiliary diesel
   engines and diesel generators on ships must be kept operating and online
   while at berth to supply auxiliary loads of ship. To address these
   requirements, one possible solution would be to provide cold-ironing
   facilities at all ports. However, in many circumstances, this is not
   cost-efficient as a port might be far from the national grid. To
   overcome these limitations, a seaport microgrid can be formed through
   the integration of multiple shipboard microgrids (SMGs) with
   decentralized control together with a charging infrastructure that is
   located on-shore. This integration of multiple SMGs and port-based
   charging stations is termed a ship-based seaport microgrid. Typically,
   power is shared among different microgrids using data communication
   techniques, which adds to the cost and the complexity of the overall
   system. This article proposes a communication-less approach based on
   multimode, decentralized droop control that enables power sharing among
   several SMGs in both charging and discharging modes based on the state
   of charge of battery banks-electric power is either supplied or
   consumed. The proposed approach would be potentially useful for future
   autonomous ships and also for islands where port electrification is
   either not technically feasible or an economically viable solution. A
   simulation and hardware-in-the-loop results are provided to verify the
   control robustness of the proposed control strategy.},

Title = {Translating resilience-based management theory to practice for coral
   bleaching recovery in Hawai'i},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {58-68},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {More frequent and severe coral bleaching events are prompting managers
   to seek practical interventions to promote ecosystem resilience.
   Although resilience-based management is now well established
   theoretically, there have been few examples of implementation. In
   Hawai'i, back-to-back bleaching events in 2014 and 2015 caused
   significant damage motivating the state to seek guidance on next steps
   for recovery. Hawai'i is a unique case study in distilling global
   recommendations to place-based action because of its ecological and
   social diversity. This study conducted a systematic review of literature
   using a weighted point system to evaluate and rank twelve potential
   Hawai'i-specific interventions to promote coral recovery following a
   bleaching event. Papers were scored based on their ability to achieve
   their management objective as well as their ability to directly affect
   coral recovery. A total of 100 papers were included in the review which
   varied in their scale (multi-site or case study), location (inside or
   outside of Hawah), and type of data collected (theoretical or
   empirical). Establishing a network of herbivore management areas ranked
   the highest followed by parrotfish size limits for action that could
   promote recovery in Hawai'i. Establishing a network of no-take Marine
   Protected Areas (MPAs) was the intervention with the most literature and
   ranked third. This method provided a systematic way to compare the
   effectiveness of management interventions, a system that could be
   adapted to other regions. This type of evidence-based approach can lead
   to more fair and transparent decision-making processes, assisting reef
   managers in navigating the translation of resilience-based management
   from theory to practice.},

Abstract = {The South Carolina Aquarium's Resilience Initiative for Coastal
   Education (R.I.C.E.) is a scalable model for community resilience
   outreach and action that facilitates engagement across socioeconomic
   strata and aids the collaborative development of coordinated coastal
   resilience strategies along the South Atlantic Bight. Projected
   biosphere climate perturbations pose a significant threat to human
   health and safety, commerce, culture, and stability of ecosystem
   services on a local level, particularly in the South Carolina Low
   country. At notable risk are socially vulnerable communities, the
   cultural heritage of the Gullah Geechee people, and the reproductive
   success of threatened loggerhead sea turtles reliant on South Carolina's
   Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge for nesting purposes. The R.I.C.E.
   endeavor's solution-oriented collaborative approach leverages innovative
   technologies and novel methods to engage citizens, inclusive of
   environmental justice principles, in locally-appropriate
   resilience-building actions. Advanced technological tools, including the
   SeaRise Beta web application with integrated citizen science
   functionality, generate community literacy on the topic of sea level
   rise and efficiently convert knowledge to action to help communities
   actualize on-the-ground mitigation strategies in partnership with
   municipal leaders, policy makers, conservation agencies, and businesses.
   The initial success of the R.I.C.E. model bolsters its ability to serve
   as a national prototype for effective education and engagement of
   diverse communities on the topic of coastal resilience.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {119},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {181-197},

Abstract = {Sustainable fisheries management into the future will require both
   understanding of and adaptation to climate change. A risk management
   approach is appropriate due to uncertainty in climate projections and
   the responses of target species. Management strategy evaluation (MSE)
   can underpin and support effective risk management. Climate change
   impacts are likely to differ by species and spatially. We use a spatial
   MSE applied to a multi-species data-poor sea cucumber/beche-de-mer
   fishery to demonstrate the utility of MSE to test the performance of
   alternative harvest strategies in meeting fishery objectives; this
   includes the ability to manage through climate variability and change,
   and meeting management objectives pertaining to resource status and
   fishery economic performance. The impacts of fishing relative to the
   impacts of climate change are distinguished by comparing future
   projection distributions relative to equivalent no-fishing
   no-climate-change trials. The 8 modelled species exhibit different
   responses to environmental variability and have different economic
   value. Status quo management would result in half the species falling
   below target levels, moderate risks of overall and local depletion, and
   significant changes in species composition. The three simple strategies
   with no monitoring (spatial rotation, closed areas, multi-species
   composition) were all successful in reducing these risks, but with
   fairly substantial decreases in the average profit. Higher profits (for
   the same risk levels) could only be achieved with strategies that
   included monitoring and hence adaptive management. Spatial management
   approaches based on adaptive feedback performed best overall.},

Title = {Possible impacts of sea level rise on disease transmission and potential

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {217},
Pages = {951-968},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Sea levels are projected to rise in response to climate change, causing
   the intrusion of sea water into land. In flat coastal regions, this
   would generate an increase in shallow water covered areas with limited
   circulation. This scenario raises a concern about the consequences it
   could have on human health, specifically the possible impacts on disease
   transmission. In this review paper we identified three categories of
   diseases which are associated with water and whose transmission can be
   affected by sea level rise. These categories include: mosquitoborne
   diseases, naturalized organisms (Vibrio spp. and toxic algae), and
   fecal-oral diseases. For each disease category, we propose comprehensive
   adaptation strategies that would help minimize possible health risks.
   Finally, the City of Key West, Florida is analyzed as a case study, due
   to its inherent vulnerability to sea level rise. Current and projected
   adaptation techniques are discussed as well as the integration of
   additional recommendations, focused on disease transmission control.
   Given that sea level rise will likely continue into the future, the
   promotion and implementation of positive adaptation strategies is
   necessary to ensure community resilience. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Building Infrastructure Resilience in Coastal Flood Risk Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {145},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The alteration of a watershed's hydrologic response due to urban
   development, population growth, global warming, and sea level rise have
   increased the frequency and intensity of floods. In order to cope with
   the new challenges in coastal flood management, many efforts were made
   after Superstorm Sandy. These efforts call for better understanding of
   flood hazard, better understanding of the operation of infrastructures
   in a resilience context, ways to mitigate hazard impacts, rebuilding
   efforts by adaptive design, and developing a unified scale of resilience
   for measuring performance. In this paper, attempts have been made to
   address implementation of these measures. The main purpose of this study
   is to improve resilience in infrastructures, particularly
   wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs), which play a pivotal role in urban
   lifelines in New York City. To do this, first, a flood inundation map
   has been generated to evaluate the current response of the study area to
   a 100-year flood and determine the flood inundation depth at WWTPs.
   Next, a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was utilized to
   quantify the resilience index as a system performance indicator.
   Afterward, two approaches based on resilience-improving measures have
   been considered to improve this index. The first approach is to provide
   redundancies between WWTPs to make a platform for WWTPs' cooperation to
   move the sewage between them. The second approach is to implement
   adaptive hazard mitigation practices such as best management practices
   (BMPs) based on a proposed framework of a key initiative in New York
   City. In order to prioritize various groups of BMPs, five methods of
   flood mitigation practices, namely resist, delay, discharge, store, and
   retreat, have been ranked using experts' opinions in a MCDM framework.
   Thereafter, resilience improvements based on the two aforementioned
   approaches have been compared by considering financial resources
   allocation to each WWTP, and the most efficient alternative solutions
   have been chosen. The methodology outlined in this paper can be utilized
   in other urban coastal settings to plan for better flood preparedness.},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts are increasingly complex owing to compounding,
   interacting, and cascading risks across sectors. However, approaches to
   support Disaster Risk Management (DRM) addressing the underlying
   (uncertain) risk driver interactions are still lacking. We tailor the
   approach of Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) to DAPP-MR to design
   DRM pathways for complex, dynamic multi-risk in multi-sector systems. We
   review the recent multi-hazard and multi-sector research to identify
   relevant aspects of multi-risk management frameworks and illustrate the
   suitability of DAPP-MR using a stylized case. It is found that
   rearranging the analytical steps of DAPP by introducing three iteration
   stages can help to capture interactions, trade-offs, and synergies
   across hazards and sectors. We show that DAPP-MR may guide multi-sector
   processes to stepwise integrate knowledge toward multi-risk management.
   DAPP-MR can be seen as an analytical basis and first step toward an
   operational, integrative, and interactive framework for short-to
   long-term multi-risk DRM.},

Title = {Climate adaptation in Coastal Virginia: an analysis of existing policies
   and main stakeholders},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change have sparked policy responses at different
   governance levels. Studying the central adaptation policies and
   understanding the interactions and complexities of governmental and
   non-governmental stakeholders is essential in guiding policymakers at
   different levels of government to formulate policies and make investment
   decisions. With strategic and economic significance on the national
   level, Coastal Virginia has one of the highest rates of sea-level rise
   in the United States, instigating intensified and more frequent climate
   hazards such as flooding and storms. This paper strives to characterize
   the status of adaptation policymaking in this region through a novel
   keyword analysis method and a thematic analysis of interviews with the
   main adaptation decision-makers and stakeholders. We identify the
   central adaptation policies and programmes at the local, regional,
   state, and federal level, as well as the major relevant players. This
   provides a comprehensible narrative of adaptation policymaking, which
   could be exploited to further analyze governance gaps and adaptation
   challenges. The approach and methodologies of this research could be
   implemented in similar studies for other areas of the U.S. that are at
   high climate risk, possibly facilitating an informed national adaptation
   policy, long overdue by the federal government. The research is also
   relevant for other jurisdictions at risk of sea-level rise.Key policy
   insightsCoastal adaptation policymaking in Virginia has been a bottom-up
   and fragmented process initiated by most affected localities, exhibiting
   the importance of local initiatives in higher-level adaptation
   policies.The long-lasting impacts of 100 Resilient cities and Dutch
   Dialogues in the City of Norfolk highlight the value of fostering
   cross-geographic coordination and capacity-building programmes,
   confirming the importance of informal policy networks in learning and
   innovation for adaptation.There is a vast difference among localities in
   adaptation planning and implementation, creating the need for
   coordinating state leadership.Adaptation policymaking in Virginia has
   been influenced by political cycles with priorities drastically altered
   by each administration change, introducing significant uncertainty for
   continuation of policies.National policies and programmes, such as the
   Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, can significantly affect local-level
   policies and decision-making.},

   The study determined the knowledge, attitude and practice towards
   climate change among the residents of Ifo LGA, Ogun State, South West,
   Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was done among 410
   residents in Ifo L. G. A, using an interviewer - administered
   questionnaire. Almost six out of ten (57.6\%) respondents had poor
   knowledge on climate change, 48\% had positive attitude, while more than
   two thirds (69.8\%) had poor practices concerning the mitigation of
   climate change. The study revealed inadequate knowledge and practices
   towards climate change mitigation among the residents, while their
   attitude was fairly positive. However, respondents demonstrated
   willingness to reduce carbon emissions. Educational campaigns, aimed at
   improving climate change knowledge, its effects on lives and properties,
   need to be instituted in this community. Such campaigns together with
   approaches at fostering institution-community partnerships, will
   translate into positive attitude and actions towards mitigating the

Title = {Powerless spectators, coping actors, and adaptive co-managers: a
   synthesis of the role of communities in ecosystem management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We provide a synthesis of the papers in the Special Issue, the
   Communities Ecosystems and Livelihoods component of the Millennium
   Ecosystem Assessment ( MA), and other recent publications on the
   adaptive capacity of communities and their role in ecosystem management.
   Communities adapt because they face enormous challenges due to policies,
   conflicts, demographic factors, ecological change, and changes in their
   livelihood options, but the appropriateness of their responses varies.
   Based on our synthesis, three broad categories of adaptive communities
   are identified. ``Powerless spectator{''} communities have a low
   adaptive capacity and weak capacity to govern, do not have financial or
   technological options, and lack natural resources, skills, institutions,
   and networks. ``Coping actor{''} communities have the capacity to adapt,
   but are not managing social - ecological systems. They lack the capacity
   for governance because of lack of leadership, of vision, and of
   motivation, and their responses are typically short term. ``Adaptive
   manager{''} communities have both adaptive capacity and governance
   capacity to sustain and internalize this adaptation. They invest in the
   long-term management of ecosystem services. Such communities are not
   only aware of the threats, but also take appropriate action for
   long-term sustainability. Adaptive co-management becomes possible
   through leadership and vision, the formation of knowledge networks, the
   existence or development of polycentric institutions, the establishment
   and maintenance of links between culture and management, the existence
   of enabling policies, and high levels of motivation in all role players.
   Adaptive co-managers are empowered, but empowerment is a consequence of
   the capacity for governance and the capacity to adapt, rather than a
   starting point. Communities that are able to enhance their adaptive
   capacity can deal with challenges such as conflicts, make difficult
   trade-offs between their short- and long-term well- being, and implement
   rules for ecosystem management. This improves the capacity of the
   ecosystem to continue providing services.},

Title = {Influence of Climate Change on Chestnut Trees: A Review},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The chestnut tree (Castanea spp.) is an important resource worldwide. It
   is cultivated due to the high value of its fruits and wood. The
   evolution between Castanea biodiversity and humans has resulted in the
   spread of chestnut genetic diversity. In 2019, the chestnut tree area
   worldwide was approximately 596 x 10(3) ha for fruit production
   (Southern Europe, Southwestern United States of America, and Asia). In
   Europe 311 x 10(3) t were produced. Five genetic poles can be
   identified: three in Greece, the northwest coast of the Iberian
   Peninsula, and the rest of the Mediterranean. Over the years, there have
   been some productivity changes, in part associated with climate change.
   Climate is considered one of the main drivers of biodiversity and
   ecosystem change. In the future, new challenges associated with climate
   change are expected, which could threaten this crop. It is essential to
   identify the impacts of climate change on chestnut trees, improving the
   current understanding of climate-tree interconnections. To deal with
   these projected changes adaptation strategies must be planned. This
   manuscript demonstrates the impacts of climate change on chestnut
   cultivation, reviewing the most recent studies on the subject.
   Furthermore, an analysis of possible adaptation strategies against the
   potentially negative impacts was studied.},

Title = {Vulnerability and costs of adaptation strategies for housing subjected
   to flood risks: Application to La Gueriniere France},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal flooding along the Atlantic coast caused by Storm Xynthia killed
   41 people. The location and configuration of residential housing were
   the main factors affecting the vulnerability of people to flooding. The
   French government responded by destroying buildings in the most
   flood-prone areas and relocating residents to safer areas. This strategy
   attracted much criticism, in particular because of the high costs
   involved with demolition on this scale, and that not insufficient
   consideration was given to other possible solutions. In this study, the
   goal is to compare different adaptation strategies in terms of cost of
   implementation and efficiency in order to reduce the vulnerability of
   houses to flooding. The strategies are grouped based on: (i) protection,
   (ii) relocation, (iii) housing architectural adaptation, and (iv)
   preventive warning and evacuation. This work is applied to La
   Gueriniere, an Atlantic coastal town at risk of coastal flooding,
   although it was not impacted by Storm Xynthia. The initial results show
   that the most efficient strategy to reduce housing vulnerability to
   coastal flooding is also the most expensive. Ranked from the most to the
   least efficient and expensive, the strategies are as follows: (i)
   relocation, (ii) housing architectural adaptation, (iii) protection,
   (iv) and preventive warning and evacuation. Until now, these strategies
   have been limited as they omit human behaviour in response to coastal
   flooding scenarios. Therefore, this study examines the role of human
   behaviour in relation to different mitigative strategies. The efficiency
   and costs of the strategies are then reappraised.},

Title = {Engaging with uncertainty and ambiguity through participatory `Adaptive
   Pathways' approaches: scoping the literature},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation planning demands decision-making under
   conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. Adaptive Pathways (AP) planning
   is receiving increased attention as a method to guide adaptation
   planning in the face of uncertainties. The approach has been most
   extensively developed and applied in large, well-funded contexts such as
   the Thames Barrier and Dutch Delta program. However, the development of
   AP planning has focused much less on the parallel need for engaging with
   the challenge of ambiguity-that there are diverse, sometimes contending,
   knowledges, values, and stakes involved. A more nascent body of work has
   been exploring ways of engaging with both the uncertainties and
   ambiguities of adaptation through various participatory approaches to AP
   planning. This paper sought to synthesise insights from this emerging
   work. Examining the peer-reviewed and grey literature identified eight
   cases from four countries across five different policy issues that
   provided details of how they approached diverse participation. Analysis
   of this small suite of cases provided some key insights for those
   seeking to use participatory approaches to AP planning to engage with
   the inherent uncertainties and (arguably necessary) ambiguities of
   adaptation. The paper concludes with a call for greater publication of
   details regarding how participatory approaches to methods such as AP
   planning have been undertaken not just what was undertaken.},

Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {549},
Pages = {239-248},

Abstract = {Modern Arctic Indigenous peoples face many interconnected pressures, not
   the least of which is anthropogenic climate change, which is emerging as
   one of the most dramatic drivers of social and economic change in recent
   memory. In this paper, we investigate whether or not insights into
   premodern strategies for coping with climate change-and especially the
   ``deeper histories{''} of traditional ways-of-knowing-can play a useful
   role in future planning, management and mitigation efforts. We do this
   in two ways. First, we assess this special issue's 17 archaeological
   case studies, in order to determine whether they are conducted within a
   framework that is consistent with approaches to resilience in studies of
   modern Arctic communities. Second, we focus on three climate-driven
   challenges faced by Canadian Arctic Inuit: safe travel, food security
   and food safety. For each, we identify specific ways in which studies of
   past social-ecological systems intersect with modern climate adaptation.
   We conclude that since archaeological insights highlight the operation
   of decision-making processes within long-term culture-adaptive
   trajectories, they can offer unique insights into the much shorter-term
   processes currently underway. While we highlight many potential
   directions for productive collaboration, much more work is required in
   local and regional settings to demonstrate the full potential of
   archaeology for future-oriented planning and mitigation efforts.},

Title = {Assessing South Africa's Potential to Address Climate Change Impacts and
   Adaptation in the Fisheries Sector},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {The marine fisheries sector is one of the most important income sectors
   in South Africa and plays an important role in food security for
   small-scale and subsistence fishers. Climate-driven impacts have
   resulted in distribution shifts and declines in abundance of important
   fisheries targets, with negative consequences to the users dependent on
   these resources. The sustainability of the sector depends on its
   readiness to adapt to climate change. The inclusion of climate change
   impacts and adaptation in fisheries management documents in South Africa
   is essential to ensure adequate climate adaptation responses are
   implemented at the short- and long-term. This study aims to 1) determine
   if the relevant fisheries national management documents address climate
   change and adaptation, 2) determine if the relevant national climate
   change documents address climate change and adaptation in the fisheries
   sector and 3) evaluate the extent to which fisheries management
   documents address climate change and adaptation. A content analysis of
   fisheries management and climate change documents was carried out to
   determine if they incorporated information on climate change impacts and
   adaptation and marine fisheries respectively. Fisheries management
   documents were then screened against nine pre-determined criteria (or
   themes) based on climate change adaptation to determine the level of
   inclusion of best practice for climate change adaptation. Results
   indicate that climate change impacts and adaptation are rarely
   incorporated in the main fisheries management documents, except for the
   Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Plan for the agriculture,
   fisheries and forestry sectors. However, this document is still waiting
   to be adopted. The only direct reference identified in all the fisheries
   documents that supports climate change adaptation was `conservation and
   sustainable management of biodiversity'. With regards to indirect
   references to climate change adaptation, `equity,' `participatory
   management,' and `capacity building' were most frequently incorporated
   in fisheries management documents. There is a need to explicitly
   incorporate information on climate change impacts and adaptation in
   South African fisheries management documents and increase the human and
   financial capacity at national institutions to ensure that the fisheries
   sector can adequately adapt to climate change.},

Abstract = {While governments and natural resource managers grapple with how to
   respond to climatic changes, many marine-dependent individuals,
   organisations and user-groups in fast-changing regions of the world are
   already adjusting their behaviour to accommodate these. However, we have
   little information on the nature of these autonomous adaptations that
   are being initiated by resource user-groups. The east coast of Tasmania,
   Australia, is one of the world's fastest warming marine regions with
   extensive climate-driven changes in biodiversity already observed. We
   present and compare examples of autonomous adaptations from marine users
   of the region to provide insights into factors that may have constrained
   or facilitated the available range of autonomous adaptation options and
   discuss potential interactions with governmental planned adaptations. We
   aim to support effective adaptation by identifying the suite of changes
   that marine users are making largely without government or management
   intervention, i.e. autonomous adaptations, to better understand these
   and their potential interactions with formal adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {How farmers perceive climate change has an influence on how they adapt
   to climate change. Climate change perception and vulnerability were
   assessed based on the household survey information collected from
   randomly selected 118 farmers of Kalapara subdistrict in Bangladesh.
   This paper identified the socio-economic covariates of climate change
   perception and vulnerability in relation to agricultural adaptation. It
   was also determined whether their perception was consistent with
   meteorological information. Findings revealed that the farmers had a
   moderate level of perception of and vulnerability to climate change. An
   overwhelming majority (98\%) of the respondents perceived a wanner
   summer and 96\% of them observed a colder winter compared to the past.
   Among the fanners, 91\% believed that rainfall had increased and 97\%
   thought that the timing of rainfall had changed. The belief of increase
   in soil salinity and associated loss was prevailing among 98 and 99\% of
   them, respectively. Observed climate data were mostly aligned with the
   fanners' perception with respect to temperature, rainfall, floods,
   droughts and salinity. Positive correlations were found among the
   perception of climate change, the perception of vulnerability and the
   number of adopted adaptation practices. Farmers' level of understanding
   of climate change, vulnerability and adaptation practices could be
   improved by involving them in different organizations, such as climate
   field school and farmer associations. It could accelerate the
   dissemination of agricultural adaptation practices among them to cope
   with adverse agricultural impacts of climate change.},

Abstract = {The South American (SA) region is particularly vulnerable to climate
   change and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events which threaten its
   economy and sustainable development. Therefore, climate adaptation is a
   regional priority. At least 6\% of SA population live at low-elevation
   coastal zones (LECZ) exposed to sea-level rise, ENSO variability and
   storminess. This paper reviews some recent and current adaptation
   experiences in SA coasts focusing on (i) socioeconomic and vulnerability
   status, (ii) links between adaptation and sustainable development, and
   (iii) constraints to adaptation. Despite the regional economic growth
   and poverty reduction over the last decade, an adaptation deficit to
   current climate variability persists. Overall, SA countries show a poor
   link between public policies, adaptation, and theoretical-academic
   scope. Public adaptation efforts in coastal areas are mostly oriented
   towards risk assessment, vulnerability and reduction of impacts at urban
   and touristic settlements. Many experiences developed from the academy
   follow the community-based adaptation (CBA) approach mainstreamed into
   local plans. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, social
   priorities, allocation of resources and the multifaceted impacts of
   climate change. Two coastal CBA case studies in Venezuela and Uruguay
   based on scientific and local knowledge show that non-structural
   adaptation measures can improve the populations' perception of risks,
   provided that stakeholders, mainly the community, are informed and
   integrated to define adaptation actions. There are lots of plans and
   less specific actions. We propose that the assessment of adaptation
   success has to rely on implementation and effectiveness criteria rather
   than solely on plans.},

Abstract = {The health risks of a changing climate are immediate and multifaceted.
   Policies, plans, and programs to reduce climate-related health impacts
   exist, but multiple barriers hinder the uptake of these strategies, and

   Implementation science-a discipline focused on systematically examining
   the gap between knowledge and action-can address questions related to
   implementation and help the health sector scale up successful adaptation
   measures in response to climate change. Implementation science, in the
   context of a changing climate, can guide decision makers in introducing
   and prioritizing potential health adaptation and disaster risk
   management solutions, advancing sustainability initiatives, and
   evaluating and improving intervention strategies. In this article we
   highlight examples from Pacific Island countries and outline approaches

Abstract = {Coastal regions of developing countries are highly vulnerable to climate
   impacts. Climate change is projected to increase sea level rise, coastal
   storm events, and natural resource scarcity, impacting coastal
   ecosystems and societies. These climate impacts intersect with other
   anthropogenic stressors contributing to the degradation of coastal
   habitats and ecosystems (driven by, among other things, development,
   encroachment and pollution), increasing the risk of coastal hazards.
   Given the complexities of coastal adaptation and the reality of scarce
   financial and human resources, policymakers must make challenging
   decisions regarding which adaptation strategies to prioritize. This
   study seeks to understand: 1) What approaches to coastal adaptation have
   been most commonly implemented in projects financed through multilateral
   adaptation funds? and 2) Were the projects designed to build
   climate-specific or broader adaptive capacity? Using a content analysis
   of project proposals for 60 coastal adaptation projects financed through
   multilateral adaptation funds across 39 countries (as well as two
   regional projects), we categorized adaptation approaches and assessed
   contributions to adaptive capacity. Our findings indicate that policy,
   planning, and capacity-building, as compared to more tangible
   implementation activities, have characterized most coastal adaptation
   projects in the past 15 years. We also found a common emphasis on
   climate-specific adaptive capacity which diverges from the widely
   discussed need to address climate change and development priorities
   synergistically. In the context of limited resources, decisions
   regarding which adaptation approaches to invest in inherently involves
   trade-offs that need to be explicitly acknowledged. While numerous
   regional studies have analyzed these trade-offs, our study provides a
   global context and identifies potential areas of underinvestment for
   coastal adaptation in developing countries. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {Land Use Improvement as the Drought Mitigation to Manage Climate Change
   in the Dodokan Watershed, Lombok, Indonesia},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Dodokan watershed is one of the priority watersheds on Lombok
   Island, which is a mainstay for providing water for the community but
   has a high vulnerability to drought. This condition causes disruption to
   the fulfillment of water needs, so it needs to be anticipated early with
   mitigation actions. Understanding the trend of drought is needed as a
   basis for developing mitigation measures, especially related to land use
   in the watershed. This study aims to analyze the hydro-meteorological
   drought trend that occurred from 2009 to 2020 and to find out the role
   of land use improvement in mitigating drought, which is predicted in the
   next 10 years. The Thornthwaite-Mather method was used for drought
   analysis, and its predictions for the next 10 years were determined by
   using trend analysis. Land use simulation using a spatial analysis was
   carried out as an effort to prepare for drought mitigation actions. The
   results show that the drought in the Dodokan Watershed has increased in
   the period between 2009-2020 and is predicted to continue to increase.
   Land use improvement by restoring the forest is a more appropriate
   mitigation method to overcome the drought than rearranging the
   agricultural land on slopes above 25\%. The simulation results have
   succeeded in increasing the water surplus and reducing the water deficit
   in 2030 so that it can be used for drought mitigation in the Dodokan
   watershed.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, humans living in the coastal area constantly adapt
   to the natural environment and create a changing environment. The rapid
   coastal development occurred in the mid-19th century and peaks in the
   mid-20th century, which was a common process in most industrialized
   areas. With increasing population growth and urban sprawl, many coastal
   lowlands are unprecedently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as
   sea level rise, increasing extreme storm events, and coastal flooding.
   Under the influence of urban revitalization and conservation, the
   landward shoreline movement accelerated and coastal land shrank,
   accompanied by community retreat. This research focuses on the
   importance of incorporating an understanding of the changing coastal
   land-ocean interaction into adaptive management strategies by
   illustrating the relationship of land use change, social-economic
   development, and climate change. Typical coastal changes in Connecticut
   were selected: New Haven Harbor reflects a dramatic seaward land
   accretion under industrial and transportation development, New London
   downtown waterfront reveals a trend of building retreat under industrial
   and commercial transformation and coastal hazard, New London Ocean Beach
   indicates how overdeveloped coastal low-lying community fully retreat
   after a natural disaster, and Jordan Cove barrier island shows a highly
   dynamic coastal land change and proactive management strategy. The
   results reveal that to cope with a constantly changing shoreline and the
   challenges of climate change, a resilient management process must
   incorporate a cycle of learning, experimenting, and creating with the
   goal of developing new solutions that are able to deal with our
   ever-changing environment.},

Abstract = {Climate change threatens tropical coastal communities and ecosystems.
   Governments, resource managers, and communities recognize the value of
   assessing the social and ecological impacts of climate change, but there
   is little consensus on the most effective framework to support
   vulnerability and adaptation assessments. The framework presented in
   this research is based on a gap analysis developed from the
   recommendations of climate and adaptation experts. The article
   highlights social and ecological factors that affect vulnerability to
   climate change; adaptive capacity and adaptation options informing
   policy and conservation management decisions; and a methodology
   including criteria to assess current and future vulnerability to climate
   change. The framework is intended for conservation practitioners working
   in developing countries, small island nations, and traditional
   communities. It identifies core components that assess climate change
   impacts on coastal communities and environments at the local scale, and
   supports the identification of locally relevant adaptation strategies.
   Although the literature supporting vulnerability adaptation assessments
   is extensive, little emphasis has been placed on the systematic
   validation of these tools. To address this, we validate the framework
   using the Delphi technique, a group facilitation technique used to
   achieve convergence of expert opinion, and address gaps in previous

Abstract = {Global warming and elevated temperatures in the Netherlands will
   increase the energy demand for cooling. Studying passive strategies to
   cope with the consequences of climate change is inevitable. This paper
   investigates the thermal performance of courtyard dwellings in the
   Netherlands. The effects of different orientations and elongations, cool
   roofs and pavements on indoor thermal comfort are studied through
   simulations and field measurements. The results show that North-South
   and East-West orientations provide the least and most comfortable indoor
   environments. Regarding materials, the use of green on roofs and as
   courtyard pavement is the most effective heat mitigation strategy. It
   was observed that the effects of wet cool roofs are much higher than of
   dry roofs. Cool roofs did not show a specific negative effect (heat
   loss) as compared to conventional asphalt roofs in winter. Some
   simulation results were validated through field measurement with a 0.91
   degrees C root mean square deviation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Deep-Sea Bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 Has Two Dimethyl
   Sulfoxide Reductases in Distinct Subcellular Locations},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) acts as a substantial sink for dimethyl
   sulfide (DMS) in deep waters and is therefore considered a potential
   electron acceptor supporting abyssal ecosystems. Shewanella
   piezotolerans WP3 was isolated from west Pacific deep-sea sediments, and
   two functional DMSO respiratory subsystems are essential for maximum
   growth of WP3 under in situ conditions (4 degrees C/20MPa). However, the
   relationship between these two subsystems and the electron transport
   pathway underlying DMSO reduction by WP3 remain unknown. In this study,
   both DMSO reductases (type I and type VI) in WP3 were found to be
   functionally independent despite their close evolutionary relationship.
   Moreover, immunogold labeling of DMSO reductase subunits revealed that
   the type I DMSO reductase was localized on the outer leaflet of the
   outer membrane, whereas the type VI DMSO reductase was located within
   the periplasmic space. CymA, a cytoplasmic membrane-bound tetraheme
   c-type cytochrome, served as a preferential electron transport protein
   for the type I and type VI DMSO reductases, in which type VI accepted
   electrons from CymA in a DmsEand DmsF-independent manner. Based on these
   results, we proposed a core electron transport model of DMSO reduction
   in the deep-sea bacterium S. piezotolerans WP3. These results
   collectively suggest that the possession of two sets of DMSO reductases
   with distinct subcellular localizations may be an adaptive strategy for
   WP3 to achieve maximum DMSO utilization in deep-sea environments.
   IMPORTANCE As the dominant methylated sulfur compound in deep oceanic
   water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been suggested to play an important
   role in the marine biogeochemical cycle of the volatile anti-greenhouse
   gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Two sets of DMSO respiratory systems in the
   deep-sea bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 have previously been
   identified to mediate DMSO reduction under in situ conditions (4 degrees
   C/20 MPa). Here, we report that the two DMSO reductases (type I and type
   VI) in WP3 have distinct subcellular localizations, in which type I DMSO
   reductase is localized to the exterior surface of the outer membrane and
   type VI DMSO reductase resides in the periplasmic space. A core electron
   transport model of DMSO reduction in WP3 was constructed based on
   genetic and physiological data. These results will contribute to a
   comprehensive understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of anaerobic
   respiratory systems in benthic microorganisms.},

Title = {Building-level adaptation analysis under uncertain sea-level rise},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Abstract = {Recent studies show climate-induced sea-level rise (SLR) will accelerate
   storm surge impacts in many coastal areas around the world. The
   decision-making of building-level adaptation strategies is a challenging
   task due to uncertain climate impacts. This study evaluates
   building-level adaptation strategies through a dynamic programming-based
   cost-benefit analysis approach to incorporate the latest information of
   SLR in adaptation decision-making. The adaptation outcomes are estimated
   by applying a Monte-Carlo method with stochastic flood damage of
   buildings under four SLR projections. Based on a case study in Bay
   County, Florida (USA), results indicate that single-family and
   multi-family buildings are the most vulnerable buildings in Bay County.
   Mobile homes have a lower flood risk, while they are more sensitive to
   SLR. The long-term flood damage shows SLR could exponentially increase
   the average annual flood damage in the community from \$17.7 million to
   \$204 million. Investing in adaptive measures can substantially mitigate
   building-level flood risk, where the adapted average annual damage
   ranges from \$9.57 million to \$38.2 million in the county. The proposed
   adaptation method could facilitate more effective risk communications
   between the public and private sectors and improvise community
   adaptation planning under uncertain SLR.},

Title = {A comparative review on the mitigation strategies of urban heat island
   (UHI): a pathway for sustainable urban development},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {With continuous acceleration of urbanization, the complexity of the
   urban geometry leads to great changes in the surface albedo, which
   further affects the microclimates of urban areas, and gives rise to the
   urban heat island effect (UHI). The UHI effect results in a series of
   environmental problems, including frequent occurrence of abnormal
   weather conditions, pollution of atmospheric environment, increases in
   building energy consumption and even underlying dangers to urban
   residents. This paper proposes a critical review on the mechanisms and
   effectiveness of the major UHI mitigation strategies, i.e. using cool
   materials, arranging vegetation schemes, incorporating water bodies and
   optimizing the urban geometry. The review indicates that the ambient air
   temperature could be reduced by 1.4K similar to 3.74K, depending on the
   strategies employed. The previously available mitigation measures are
   more effective in summer cooling in Tropical, Subtropical and
   Mediterranean climates. With the increase of H/W (height-to-width) and
   SVF (sky-view factor), the cooling effects of vegetation, water body and
   cool materials are better. The review results can provide theoretical
   guidance to the planning and designing of buildings, and cities, the
   enhancement of the liveability of urban environment, and the sustainable
   development of future cities.},

Title = {Optimization, risk assessment and resilience in LNG transportation
   systems},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-264},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to address how to systematically address
   vulnerability in a maritime transportation system using a formal
   vulnerability assessment approach, create quantitative measures of
   disruption risk and test the effect of mitigating measures. These
   quantitative data are prerequisites for cost efficiency calculations,
   and may be obtained without requiring excessive resources.
   Design/methodology/approach - Supply chain simulation using
   heuristics-based planning tools offers an approach to quantify the
   impact of disruption scenarios and mitigating measures. This is used to
   enrich a risk-based approach to maritime supply chain vulnerability
   assessment. Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate a stochastic
   nature of disruptions.
   Findings - The exemplary assessment of a maritime liquefied natural gas
   (LNG) transportation system illustrates the potential for providing
   quantitative data about the cost of disruptions and the effects of
   mitigating measures, which are foundations for more precise cost
   efficiency estimates.
   Research limitations/implications - This simulation was done on a
   simplified version of a real transportation system. For resource
   reasons, several simplifications were made, both with regards to
   modeling the transportation system and with the implementation of the
   formal vulnerability assessment framework. Nevertheless, the authors
   believe the paper serves to illustrate the approach and potential
   outcome.
   Practical implications - Practitioners are provided with an approach to
   get more precise quantitative data on disruption costs and
   cost/efficiency of mitigating measures, providing background data for
   decisions on investing, in reduction of supply chain vulnerability.
   Originality/value - The combination of risk assessment methods and
   inventory routing simulation of maritime supply chain problems is a
   novelty. Quantifying vulnerability, effects of disruptions and effects
   of mitigating measures in maritime transportation systems contributes to
   a little-researched area.},

Title = {Can policy perception influence social resilience to policy change?},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {216-227},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether policy perception can erode
   or enhance the ability of commercial fishers to be resilient to changes
   in fisheries policy. An understanding of the way that fishers perceive
   resource policies provides fisheries managers with the opportunity to
   refine policy design and delivery so as to better protect system
   resilience. Policy perception is assessed by asking commercial fishers
   how they perceive their level of involvement in the policy
   decision-making process and interpret equity, the likely socio-economic
   impacts, conservation effectiveness and the rate of implementation (of
   generic policies). Social resilience to policy change is examined by
   assessing a fisher's (i) perception of risk associated with change, (ii)
   ability to plan, learn and reorganise, (iii) ability to cope, and (iv)
   level of interest in change. One hundred commercial fishers in five
   coastal communities were quantitatively and qualitatively surveyed. A
   negative perception of policy was found to significantly and adversely
   influence the behaviour and emotional response of commercial fishers,
   which, as described here, influences their resilience. For policy
   perception to be positive and resilience to be enhanced, fishers need to
   be meaningfully involved in the decision-making process, change needs to
   be implemented at an appropriate rate, and effort is required to ensure
   that equity, anticipated impacts and conservation effectiveness are
   positively interpreted. This knowledge can assist in the development of
   fisheries management strategies aimed at maintaining and enhancing
   socio-ecological resilience. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by

Abstract = {While individual countries work to achieve and strengthen their
   nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement, the
   growing emissions from two economic sectors remain largely outside most
   countries' NDCs: international shipping and international aviation.
   Reducing emissions from these sectors is particularly challenging
   because the adoption of any policies and targets requires the agreement
   of a large number of countries. However, the International Maritime
   Organization (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization
   (ICAO) have recently announced strategies to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions from their respective sectors. Here we provide information on
   the climate benefits of these proposed measures, along with related
   potential measures. Given that the global average temperature has
   already risen 1 degrees C above preindustrial levels, there is only 1.0
   or 0.5 degrees C of additional ``allowable warming{''} left to stabilize
   below the 2 or 1.5 degrees C thresholds, respectively. We find that if
   no actions are taken, CO2 emissions from international shipping and
   aviation may contribute roughly equally to an additional combined 0.12
   degrees C to global temperature rise by end of century - which is 12 \%
   and 24 \% of the allowable warming we have left to stay below the 2 or
   1.5 degrees C thresholds (1.0 and 0.5 degrees C), respectively. However,
   stringent mitigation measures may avoid over 85 \% of this projected
   future warming from the CO2 emissions from each sector. Quantifying the
   climate benefits of proposed mitigation pathways is critical as
   international organizations work to develop and meet long-term targets.},

Title = {Climate change induced human displacement in Bangladesh: Implications on
   the livelihood of displaced riverine island dwellers and their
   adaptation strategies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {In Bangladesh, many people are being displaced in riverine island (char)
   areas every year due to climate change and its associated natural
   catastrophes. This study intends to investigate the impact of climate
   change on internally displaced char people's lives and livelihoods along
   with local adaptation strategies and hindrances to the coping mechanism.
   Data have been collected from 280 internally displaced households in two
   sub-districts. A mixed-method approach has been considered combined with
   qualitative and quantitative methods. The results disclose that frequent
   flooding, riverbank erosion, and crop loss are the leading causes for
   relocation, and social relations are impeded in the new place of
   residence. Increasing summer and winter temperatures, recurrent
   flooding, severity of riverbank erosion, and expanding disease outbreaks
   are also important indicators of climate change identified by displaced
   people, which are consistent with observed data. This study also reveals
   that almost all households come across severe livelihood issues like
   food shortage, unemployment and income loss, and housing and sanitation
   problems due to the changing climate associated with disasters in the
   former and present places. In response to this, the displaced people
   acclimatize applying numerous adaptation strategies in order to boost
   the livelihood resilience against climate change. However, fragile
   housing, financial conditions, and lack of own land are still the
   highest impediments to the sustainability of adaptation. Therefore,
   along with the government, several organizations should implement a
   dynamic resettlement project through appropriate scrutiny to eradicate
   the livelihood complications of internally displaced people.},

Abstract = {Climate change due to an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in
   the atmosphere is a global issue. It can impact aquatic environments by
   affecting water flow, pollutant transformation and migration, and other
   toxicant-related effects. We assessed the interactive effects of
   temperature warming and pH changes on variations in accumulation of
   total arsenic (As-T) in the red alga Sarcodia suae at different levels
   of arsenite (As-III). Result showed that As-T variations in the alga
   were moderated by significant joint effects of warming temperature
   and/or increasing pH levels and their interactions with increasing
   As-III concentrations. Our study suggests possible deleterious impacts
   on macroalgal populations due to toxicological effects associated with
   prevailing environmental conditions. Therefore, improved pollution

Abstract = {Climate Change and its consequences will significantly impact sandy
   coasts and coastal lowlands in the Baltic Sea region. The risks of
   flooding and coastal erosion will probably rise due to higher storm

   coastal retreat will increase if sea level rise accelerates.
   Traditionally, adaptation strategies focus on technical measures like
   sea dikes, revetments or beach replenishments. After the introduction,
   this chapter starts with a discussion of sea level rise scenarios. Next,
   it is argued that a sustainable adaptation strategy implies a holistic
   coastal risk management consisting of the elements prevention,
   protection, preparedness, emergency response, recovery and review. These
   integral components are described as parts of a control loop. The
   chapter ends with an outlook, including a reflection of the EU-Flood

Title = {An assessment of the impacts of climate change on Puerto Rico's Cultural
   Heritage with a case study on sea-level rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {198-209},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we summarize how current and projected climate changes
   are expected to impact material cultural heritage in Puerto Rico. As
   case study, we also conducted a spatial analysis vulnerability
   assessment of coastal heritage sites below 20 meters in elevation.
   Results from the analysis show that of the 1185 known cultural heritage
   sites below 20 meters in elevation in Puerto Rico, 27 sites are
   inundated at today's highest high tide, 56 will be inundated by
   mid-century when assuming a 0.6 m rise in sea-level, and 140 sites will
   be inundated by end-of-century when assuming a 1.8 m rise in sea-level.
   Spatial analysis of sites adjacent to the high tide line demonstrate
   that these values are likely conservative, as there are many sites
   located within 1 m of the highest high tide line that should also be
   considered vulnerable. Finally, we present and introductory proposal
   that addresses the need for vulnerability assessments to aid cultural
   heritage managers in developing adaptive strategies for climate change
   impacts to material heritage. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {The natural hazards and influence of climate change are uncertain.
   Supporting adaptation management strategies therefore requires a strong
   research basis, including prediction and vulnerability assessments.
   However, the practical value of research results tends to be under
   explored because of the lack of channel through which to apply the
   results. This study suggests means of strengthening local adaptation
   strategies and reducing social vulnerability by encouraging communities
   to work together to deal with the threat of climate change. We highlight
   the balance among built-environmental sensitivity and human adaptability
   dimensions, thereby emphasizing social vulnerability and addressing
   social resilience from risk perception perspectives. On the basis of the
   concept of vulnerability and the driver-pressure-state-impact-response
   (DPSIR) causal framework, semi-structured interviews were designed to
   explore social resilience. We discuss how a knowledge gap can lead to
   social vulnerability and maladaptation. In addition, we propose the
   prototype of a decision-making tool for facilitating adaptation by
   emphasizing a co-design process between residents and decision makers.},

Title = {Transformation of rural communities: lessons from a local
   self-initiative for building resilience in the Solomon Islands},
Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {352-365},
Abstract = {Solomon Islands is vulnerable to negative impacts from climate change,
   where people's livelihoods and their well-being are threatened,
   especially the viability of isolated communities. Realising the
   increasing risks from climate change on communities, government, in
   partnership with aid-donor partners, has invested millions of dollars in
   climate change projects, through mitigation and adaptation strategies.
   As a form of adaptation, the government invests in programmes aimed at
   increasing the adaptive capacity of the vulnerable communities through
   landscape and seascape projects across the rural communities. Focusing
   on the ``transformation concept{''} as a long-term adaptation strategy
   and enlargement of climate engineering and ecological resilience
   concepts, the paper discusses why building resilience from
   transformation of rural communities, as well as from landscape and
   seascape projects, would benefit communities and relevant authorities.
   This paper describes the findings of a study on two rural villages,
   Keigold and Mondo, from Ranogha Islands, Western Province, in Solomon
   Islands, where 80\% of households decided to relocate from their old
   village ``Mondo{''} to their new home ``Keigold{''} after an earthquake
   in 2007, as part of a self-initiative. The reallocation process can be
   seen as a case of pro-active community transformation that provides
   valuable lessons to other rural communities that may be forced to move
   due to impacts from natural catastrophes, including those explained by
   climate change risks. Lessons from this experience suggest that
   policy-makers and non-government organisations should consider and
   empower local transformation initiatives as a way to building long-term
   adaptation to climate change.},

Abstract = {Cities are places of high vulnerability to climate change due to their
   density of people, assets, and infrastructure and their high diversity
   of people of and from different socio-economic backgrounds, gender,
   ethnicity, and age, determining knowledge and knowledge access, support
   networks, and other assets important for adaptation. The City of New
   York-on which this study is based-is highly diverse in socio-economic
   but also in natural characteristics (proximity to sea, natural areas,
   building and population density), e.g. across its 5 boroughs who serve
   as identity markers. Does these differences lead to varying and
   significant (perception of) climate change impacts? If this turns out to
   be true, city planning may need to pursue different climate change
   adaptation strategies in different boroughs, which is the underlying
   hypothesis. I employ Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping to investigate the current
   perception and affectedness of New Yorkers from all boroughs towards
   weather extreme events, i.e. heavy rainstorms and heat waves. I compare
   their impact perception and run adaptation scenarios to evaluate the
   most feasible adaptation strategy to alleviate burden.},

Abstract = {Large scale mitigation strategies showed to represent promising
   solutions for enhancing liveability in dense urban contexts. Therefore,
   most of the researches are focused on assessing the effect of high
   albedo surfaces and greenery. The paper deals with a numerical and
   experimental analysis of these evapotranspiration and high-reflectance
   surfaces in a full scale experimental set-up where more than 20 cubicles
   are monitored in a Mediterranean continental climate. The experimental
   set-up itself covers an intermediate inter-building perspective between
   the lab scale and the real urban contexts, which compromises the
   possibility to generalize final results. This scale is able to better
   control geometry of area, but allows real microclimate monitoring and
   calibration of CFD models. Starting from a validated model, this study
   simulated alternative scenarios with gradually varying the presence of
   common mitigation strategies with the scope to evaluate their effect to
   this aim. Results showed that high albedo solutions best mitigate summer
   overheating reducing the air temperature, while greenery was more
   effective in the densest configurations with low albedo envelopes,
   showing how geometry related variables may play a key role in
   determining the optima configurations of microclimate mitigation
   strategies, also important for the best exploitation of renewables in
   the built environment. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Northern communities are experiencing greater climate variability, with
   extreme climate impacts occurring more frequently and with more
   intensity; with the need for adaptation to reduce the risk becoming more
   immediate. Specific stressors and decision dynamics surrounding the
   nature of local government policy and planning for climate adaptation
   are underrepresented in the scholarship. This paper seeks to contribute
   to the literature by exploring the case of Homer, Alaska. Through
   narratives of key informants connected to the community's climate change
   agenda, this research explores primary climate stressors and the nature
   of adaptation policy integration. Findings suggests that while Homer is
   experiencing a variety of climate change impacts, adaptation remains a
   low priority for city officials. This study sheds light on some of the
   challenges of integrating climate adaptation policy with strategic
   community planning, and in turn provides decision-makers with insight
   into considerations for mainstreaming resilience thinking at a local
   government scale.},

   Thailand},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the 21st century, global sea level rise associated with climate
   change will affect beach areas, which provide a number of benefits that
   include benefits to the recreational sector of the economy. In Thailand,
   the adoption of structural measures in order to slow down beach erosion
   and handle the impact of sea level rise is commonly implemented.
   However, structural measures often bring about negative effects on
   nearby coastal areas. For this reason, suitable adaptation measures
   should be determined, in order to protect beach areas and to sustain the
   tourism carrying capacity of the beach. This study analyzed historical
   shoreline changes using satellite images, and assessed beach value with
   the hedonic pricing method. We used a benefit-cost ratio analysis to
   evaluate the economic valuation assessment of Pattaya beach and Chalatat
   beach. The results showed that the beach values of Pattaya beach and
   Chalatat beach were 1,072,250 and 92,092 USD, respectively. The
   benefit-cost ratio analysis proposed that it is worth implementing beach
   nourishment for the adaptation measure to address all climate change
   scenarios. In response to climate change, recommendations could be
   applied to support beach tourism.},

Title = {Towards mitigating marine-mammal and sea-turtle mortalities in
   small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are often considered sustainable; but
   comprise 95\% of global fishers and cumulatively evoke substantial
   ecosystem impacts that include collateral mortalities. Marine mammals
   and sea turtles are particularly vulnerable to SSF and have been the
   focus of conservation strategies. However, many strategies have fallen
   short of objectives. This study aimed to elucidate and help resolve
   associated issues by: compiling global efforts to mitigate marine-mammal
   and sea-turtle bycatches/fishing mortalities among SSF; identifying
   successful outcomes and influencing factors; and then suggesting steps
   for mitigating remaining problems. Among 150 articles, there was
   exponential temporal output, with gillnets the most studied gear (67\%).
   Approximately 71\% of all publications proposed mitigation measures but
   of these, efficacy was assessed in fewer than 2/3. While essential for
   conservation, community engagement was poorly initiated-although
   relevant studies have increased in the last decade, which may be
   correlated with studies describing management approaches instead of
   typical bycatch assessments. Mitigation measures were assessed in a
   `strength-weaknesses-opportunities-and-threats' analysis. Mitigation
   measures should benefit multiple species ('strengths'), avoid high
   costs/maintenance ('weaknesses'), be supported by community engagement
   and governmental aid/enforcement ('opportunities'), and consider
   non-compliance ('threats'). Collateral mortalities can be reduced among
   SSF, but regional adoption of technology requires impetus that is best
   achieved via community engagement. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by

Abstract = {There are several nature-based adaptation options available to coastal
   nations. In this paper, we offer a brief overview of these options and
   then focus on mangroves to consider how laws and policies can support
   nature-based solutions and thereby contribute to more effective overall
   adaptation efforts. We first outline the concept of adaptation and its
   variants, thereby setting the context for this study. We then briefly
   explore the science relating to nature-based adaptation. We analyze the
   international legal regime in place to protect mangrove ecosystems.
   Finally, we discuss the merits, the challenges, and strategies developed
   to surmount some of the challenges that coastal countries can face while
   implementing nature-based adaptation options by utilizing Bangladesh's
   experience on mangrove conservation as a case study. Ultimately, we
   conclude that it may be necessary to implement both hard and
   nature-based adaptation options and that an effective law and policy
   framework will be critical. It will also be important to look beyond
   physical coastal protection to augment coastal livelihoods and build
   resilient coastal communities with greater adaptive capacities.},

Title = {When population-advantageous primary sex ratios are female-biased:
   changing concepts to facilitate climate change management in sea turtles},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {175},

Abstract = {Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination. Because
   females are produced at high temperatures, increasing global temperature
   may lead to population feminization. Primary sex ratios (PSR) of sea
   turtle hatchlings are naturally female-biased, but this translates into
   a more balanced operational sex ratio because male turtles reproduce
   more often than females. As a consequence, a balanced PSR and the
   temperature that produces it (pivotal temperature) are of limited use to
   guide climate mitigation management because an equal PSR may be
   demographically suboptimal. Here, I define population-advantageous
   primary sex ratios (PA-PSR) as the PSR that will tend to be in
   equilibrium in a population and that will result in balanced operational
   sex ratios; I then estimate PA-PSR for different reproductive
   frequencies (years elapsed between reproductive seasons) of adult female
   and male turtles. I also define population equilibrium temperature (PET)
   as the temperature that would result in the equilibrium PSR of
   hatchlings (i.e., PA-PSR). These concepts may help assess the influence
   of rising temperatures on populations, as they can better indicate if
   PSRs depart from those at equilibrium. I compared PA-PSR and beach PSR
   for two populations of sea turtles for which male and female remigration
   intervals were known and found that a mild or no feminization over the
   PA-PSR may be occurring. Because PSR varies inter-annually, and
   hatchlings coming from beaches of different thermal conditions could
   recruit to the same population, it is critical to estimate beach PSR at
   the right temporal and spatial scales. Climate mitigation strategies
   based on these concepts could provide better management guidance for
   conservation practitioners. Similar approaches could be considered for
   other female-biased species with temperature-dependent sex
   determination.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change are global, but small islands are among
   the most vulnerable places. Local populations on small islands might
   have a ground-based perspective of the impacts that threaten them. This
   study was undertaken on Corvo (Azores), where 34\% of the residents of
   both genders and different education levels were surveyed. Here, their
   understanding of climate change and their perception of its local
   impacts, the sense of risk, the local areas at risk, the willingness to
   propose mitigation and adaptation strategies, and the knowledge of
   regional procedures was analysed. Education played a crucial role in
   local understanding. The general perception was that the regional
   policies were insufficient to address climate change issues at the local
   level. This fact points out that the efforts to mitigate climate change
   impacts, and the public participation procedures for supporting
   policy-making, must be significantly increased and improved, in order to
   reach a real impact on local island communities.},

Title = {Rotational grazing and multispecies herbal leys increase productivity in
   temperate pastoral systems-A meta-analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {337},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with ruminant livestock
   production is important for climate change mitigation. Regenerative
   Agriculture (RA) practices are increasingly promoted to improve forage
   pro-duction and livestock performance in temperate livestock systems.
   These practices include i) rotational grazing (RG) of livestock around
   multiple subunits of pasture to achieve ungrazed periods of `rest', and
   ii) herbal leys (HL), where perennial forbs such as chicory, lucerne and
   trefoils are included as components in multi-species swards. While there
   are plausible mechanisms for adoption of these practices to improve
   agricultural productivity, quantitative syntheses of their impacts are
   required. Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta -analysis of the
   effects of RG and HL practices on herbage dry matter (DM) production,
   animal daily live -weight gain (DLWG), and sheep wool growth in
   temperate oceanic regions. We use quantitative predictors in our
   Bayesian hierarchical models to investigate the role of rest period and
   stocking density in RG systems, and specific plant traits and sward
   diversity in HL. We found that herbage DM increased by 0.31 t.ha(-1)
   over a growing season as the proportion of rest in an RG grazing system
   increased from 0 to 1. Stocking density significantly moderated the
   effect of rest period on sheep and cattle DLWG; at higher stocking
   densities, longer rest periods were required to maintain livestock
   growth rates. In HL studies, herbage DM yielded 1.63 t.ha(-1) more per
   metre of increased sward root depth and a sward entirely comprised of
   legumes yielded 2.20 t.ha(-1) more than when no legumes were present.
   Sheep DLWG increased by 3.50 g.day(-1) per unit increase in leaf
   nitrogen concentration (mg.g(-1)), but we could not determine an effect
   of leaf condensed tannin content on animal performance. Although there
   remain differences between the RG and HL study treatments meta-analysed
   here and RA in practice, our results provide empirical support for some
   of the mechanisms attributed to increased pasture and livestock
   productivity following adoption of selected RA grazing practices.},

Abstract = {Adaptation is an essential part of climate change policy. In areas where
   impacts are likely to be severe, migration is considered to be an
   adaptation option. In Bangladesh coastal areas migration due to climate
   change is contingent on people's freedom of choice at individual and
   household level. Following Amartya Sen's capability approach, we argue
   that there should be a line drawn between migrations by free choice
   versus forced migration. Sen's capability approach focuses on the
   importance of people's freedom of choice to act, and the ability to
   achieve what they consider valuable in their life. In this paper, we use
   an extensive empirical work engaging 22 focus groups discussions (8-12
   individuals in each group) and 14 Key Informants Interviews in
   South-West Bangladesh to elicit how freedom of choice changes with the
   economic class and social status of an individual. Using these data we
   apply Sen's capability approach to understand the role of the freedom of
   choice when considering migration as an adaptation option. We argue that
   the capability approach is essential in revealing a thin border between
   migration as a (planned) adaptation option and forced migration.},

Abstract = {Annual dynamics of abundance and gender composition, seasonal variations
   in reproduction, respiration rate and locomotor activity of the new
   invasive cyclopoid species Oithona davisae were investigated in
   Sevastopol Bay (Black Sea) from January 2013 till July 2014. The
   abundance of O. davisae in Sevastopol Bay was highest in September -
   November at 15 - 23 degrees C and decreased dramatically in winter
   -spring period at a temperature equal or less than 8 degrees C. From the
   end of February (8 degrees C) till the middle of May (17.5 degrees C)
   the population of O. davisae was represented only by adult females.
   Copepodites were observed first only when the water temperature
   increased to 17.5 degrees C, and males appeared only in late May at 22
   degrees C. The revealed seasonal trends in copepod abundance and
   reproduction from field and experimental data suggest that winter
   population of O. davisae survives the cold season in the Black Sea at
   the stage of fertilized females which give the birth to the next
   generation in favorable spring conditions. To save energy resources,
   overwintering females have significantly lower temperature-related
   weight-specific respiration rate and moving activity than females from
   summer population. Such unique adaptation strategy facilitated the
   invasion and successful development of this thermophilic species in the
   cold Black Sea environment.},

Title = {Adaptation Through Climate Smart Agriculture: Status and Determinants in
   Coastal Bangladesh},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION, RESILIENCE AND HAZARDS},
Series = {Climate Change Management},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {157-178},
Abstract = {The adoption of climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy is
   overwhelmingly stressed in recent times. The Bangladesh Climate Change
   Strategy and Action Plan 2009 has envisaged adaptation through adoption
   of climate smart agriculture. Although the literature on agricultural
   adaptation in general has noticeably increased in recent times, little
   is known about the adoption of climate smart agriculture as a strategy
   of adaptation against climate change and extreme events. This study is
   intended to achieve two objectives. First, to assess the status of the
   adoption of climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy and
   second to examine the factors that influence the adoption of climate
   smart agriculture in environmentally stressed areas of coastal
   Bangladesh. The empirical part of this study was conducted in Dacope
   Upazila (sub-district) of south-west coastal Bangladesh. Two hundred and
   thirty five randomly selected households were interviewed through a
   semi-structured questionnaire during March-June in 2011. From a
   literature review, 25 indicators which capture three dimensions of
   climate smart agriculture, such as sustainability of production,
   resilience to change and the potential for mitigation of emissions were
   used in the questionnaire. Responses against each of these were rated in
   a 5-point Likert scale. Information about various socio-demographic,
   economic, ecological, and adaptive behavioural characteristics of
   households and their farms were collected as well. By employing the
   Principle Component Analysis (PCA) technique, weak adopters and strong
   adopters of the three dimensions of climate smart agriculture are
   identified. Finally, by employing the Multivariate Probit model, the
   influence of various factors on the adoption of climate smart
   agriculture are assessed. The adoption of sustainable production is
   mostly related to the frequent exposure to rainfall (irrigation
   facility), sharecropping, and the age of the household head. The
   adoption of adaptive measures for resilient agriculture are related to
   frequent exposures to dry spells, the size of farm landholding and
   frequent exposures to saline water. On the other hand the adoption of
   measures for the reduction of emissions are related to land degradation
   by salt, membership of a social group, and the education of the head of
   household. Other factors have very limited influence in this regard.
   Finally this study came up with some policy suggestions, the
   implementation of which would help the coastal inhabitants to better
   adopt climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy to ensure
   livelihood and food security against climate change and extreme events.},

Title = {Identifying Pathways for Climate-Resilient Multispecies Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Fish live in communities, and most fisheries catch multiple species, yet
   fishery management predominately focuses on single species. In many
   multispecies fisheries, a variety of species are generally caught
   together at similar rates. Failure to account for this adequately in
   management has resulted in serial depletion and alterations to the
   ecosystem. Ideally, multispecies fisheries management should strive to
   produce good yields from specific valuable stocks and avoid adverse
   impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems. Moreover, multispecies
   management should aim to build resilience to changes in stock
   productivity and distribution driven by climate change. Here, we present
   tools and pathways that seven fisheries are adopting to achieve these
   goals. These case studies - from Mexico, Cuba, and Chile - differ in
   data richness, governance structure, and management resources. The
   management systems are also in various stages of evolution from
   unmanaged to complete management of a single species but transitioning
   to multispecies management. While various analytical tools and
   decision-making processes are described in the case studies, a common
   feature is the use of participatory stakeholder processes to build
   capacity and socialize the importance of multispecies management. We use
   lessons from these cases to recommend a multispecies management approach
   to overcome the limitations of current practices (typically
   single-species catch limits or large spatial restrictions), using the
   participatory processes and data-limited assessments to create stock
   complexes that simplify multispecies management (i.e., the ``fish
   baskets{''} approach). Indicator species for each fish basket are
   identified to support the development of fishery performance indicators,
   reference values, harvest control rules, and management measures to
   create an adaptive management cycle to enhance the fishery's resilience
   to impacts induced by climate change and other factors.},

Abstract = {Rice production in coastal wetlands provides critical ecosystem services
   that range from flood control to wildlife habitat. In the Iberian
   Peninsula rice was introduced in the 10th Century. Today Iberian rice
   accounts for about one quarter of the total rice production of the
   European Union, almost exclusively cultivated in the coastal wetlands of
   Spain, with permanent flooding. The intensive water management required
   to produce rice stands at a crucial point since freshwater supply is
   deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. Here we explore flexible
   adaptation options to climate change in the Doana wetlands - a world
   heritage and biodiversity site - from two points of view: What are the
   policy options for agricultural water management in view of climate
   change? How can informed stakeholders contribute to better adaptation?
   The first question is addressed by simulating water availability to
   farmers with the WAAPA model under a range of adaptation policy options
   derived from the view of the local communities. The second question was
   addressed by means of participatory research. Adaptation options are
   framed according to the local environmental, social and policy context.
   Results suggest that perception on the potential role of new water
   infrastructure and farming subsidies dominates the view of local
   communities. The choices of the stakeholders that could be simulated
   with the hydrological model, were quantified in terms of additional
   water availability for the rice farming, therefore providing a
   quantitative measure to the qualitative solutions. Information provided
   during the study shaped the final adaptation options developed. Our
   research contributes to the definition of sustainable rice production in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {Climate change presents significant challenges to modelling and managing
   aquatic resources. Equilibrium assumptions common in many modelling
   approaches need to be replaced by formulations that allow for changing
   baselines and integration of ongoing changes and adaptations by species,
   ecosystems and humans. As ecosystems change, so will the ways humans
   use, monitor and manage them. Consequently, adaptive management loops
   and supporting tools deserve more prominence in the management toolbox.
   Models are critical tools for providing an early understanding of the
   challenges to be faced by integrating observations and examining
   possible solutions. We review modelling tools currently available to
   incorporate the effect of climate change on marine and freshwater
   ecosystems, and the implications for management of natural resources.
   System non-linearity can confound interpretations and hence adaptive
   management responses are needed that are robust to unexpected outcomes.
   An improvement in the ability to model the effects of climate change
   from a social and economic perspective is necessary. The outputs from
   `end-to-end' and socio-ecological models can potentially inform
   planning, in both Australia and the Pacific region, about how best to
   build resilience to climate change. In this context, the importance of
   well directed data-collection programs is also emphasised. Lessons from
   this region, which is advanced with regard to modelling approaches, can
   guide increased use of models to test options for managing aquatic
   resources worldwide.},

Title = {Cross-level differences and similarities in coastal climate change
   adaptation planning},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {279-290},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation (CCA) planning is an iterative process
   involving numerous actors and institutions at multiple levels of
   governance. This study investigates how cross-level differences may be a
   potential barrier or enabler of adaptation activities. It focuses on
   five potentially divisive issues: the level support for adaptation
   planning, adaptation goals, preferences among adaptation strategies, the
   desired role for the state vis a vis local leadership/control in
   supporting adaptation, and elements to include state level adaptation
   plans. The analysis is based on 138 questionnaires from coastal planners
   (local, state, and NGO) in Alaska, Florida, and Maryland. Findings
   reveal topics of agreement and disagreement in CCA planning across
   levels of management and study areas. State and NGO planners are
   significantly more likely than local planners to favor near-term
   planning activities and allocation of resources. This mismatch in timing
   is a potential barrier for adaptation. There were also significant
   differences in priorities motivating the development of plans among
   state, local, and NGO planners, though some differences may provide
   opportunities for the negotiation of planning priorities that have
   positive synergies. Although most planners indicated the state should
   play some role in local-level CCA planning, local planners desired a
   significantly lower level of involvement - a key threshold difference
   that represents the common and long-standing tension between state-level
   regulation and the desire for local control. The high proportion of all
   planners who have started to consider the development of CCA strategies
   and the desire for state-level adaptation plans to include support for
   risk and vulnerability assessments highlight potential synergies and
   opportunities to increase adaptive capacity and implement adaptation
   strategies. Few differences were detected among preferences for
   adaptation options. Analysis across multiple study areas provides
   additional insight into the stability and variation of cross-level
   differences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Coastal tourism space in the context of climate change: discourses and
   strategies},
Journal = {WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {549-559},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to explore how climate change and
   the discourses about adaptation to climate change are altering the
   spatial development of the tourism industry in coastal destinations. The
   paper also identifies how tourist development and climate change
   adaptation can be combined to transform space and place, especially in
   coastal tourism areas.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a theoretical approach based on the
   concept of production of space, the study focuses on relational space,
   relationships expressed through representations of space and social
   practices. A case study method is used to analyze the socio-geographic
   processes at work in the adaptation to climate change in a coastal
   tourism community in Quebec, Canada. The analysis of the study utilized
   Nvivo with thematic textual queries.
   Findings - The results reveal an adaptation process at work, based on a
   ``hold the line{''} strategy, where private stakeholders choose to
   invest in defensive structures to mitigate the impact of rising sea
   levels and erosion. This strategy reflects coordinated action in the
   face of the risk and to protect high-value land property.
   Research limitations/implications - This research illustrates how
   tourism and climate change adaptation discourses intersect. It also
   reveals how tourism development promotes the values and image of coastal
   space and how this can conflict with an efficient climate change
   adaptation strategy.
   Originality/value - This research provides guidelines for coastal
   tourism communities, enabling them to design their own climate change
   adaptation strategy, taking into account how the different social
   discourses and tourism practices interact with climate change
   adaptation. It also provides some insights into the criteria that
   influence an effective climate change adaptation strategy.},

Title = {Climate shocks and adaptation strategies in coastal Bangladesh: does
   microcredit have a part to play?},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {454-466},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Microcredit has become a component of global development. Recently, the
   climate change and disaster community have proposed that it may be able
   to facilitate climate change adaptation, but whether this is the case
   remains under-researched. Addressing this gap, this paper examines the
   question in relation to microcredit's ability to support adaptation
   strategies that effectively address vulnerability to climate shocks in
   three villages in the Bagerhat and Chattogram districts of coastal
   Bangladesh. The findings provide qualitative evidence that at-risk
   people often use microcredit as a response to climate shocks. However,
   the case study only finds evidence that microcredit supports coping and
   incremental adaptation. Findings suggest shocks (some climate-related
   and some not) can result in reduction in food consumption, erosion of
   assets, depletion of savings, increased debt, and debt default,
   `trapping' at-risk people in indebtedness through a process of
   cumulative vulnerability. Lack of outreach of microcredit, erosion of
   assets, supply barriers, and lack of credit alternatives reduce
   microcredit's potential to address the persistent determinants of
   vulnerability.},

Title = {Targeted management buffers negative impacts of climate change on the
   hihi, a threatened New Zealand passerine},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {192},
Pages = {145-153},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In order to buffer the risks climate change poses to biodiversity,
   managers need to develop new strategies to cope with an increasingly
   dynamic environment. Supplementary feeding (SF) is a commonly-used form
   of conservation management that may help buffer the impacts of climate
   change. However, the role of SF as an adaptation tool is yet to be fully
   understood. Here we used the programme MARK to quantify the relationship
   between weather (average temperature and total precipitation) and vital
   rates (survival and recruitment) of an island bird population, the hihi
   Notiomystis cincta, for which long term demographic data are available
   under periods of little and ad libitum SF. We then used predictive
   population modelling to project this population's dynamics under each
   management strategy and several climate change scenarios in accordance
   with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predictions. Our
   stochastic population projections revealed that ad libitum SF likely
   buffers the population against heavier rainfall and more stochastic
   precipitation patterns; no buffering effect on temperature was detected.
   While the current SF approach is unlikely to prevent local extinction of
   the population under increasing temperatures, SF still presents itself
   as a valuable climate change adaptation tool by delaying extinction. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the
   interaction between climate and SF intensity of a threatened population.
   We call for on-going critical evaluation of management measures, and
   suggest that novel adaptation solutions that combine current approaches
   are required for conserving species with limited opportunity for
   dispersal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modelling large-scale carbon dioxide injection into the Bunter Sandstone
   in the UK Southern North Sea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {220-233},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Bunter Sandstone in the UK sector of the Southern North Sea Basin is
   a reservoir rock that is typically 200 m or more thick and has variable
   but commonly fair to good porosity and permeability. East of the Dowsing
   Fault Zone it is folded into a number of large periclines as a result of
   post-depositional halokinesis in the underlying Zechstein salt. It is
   sealed by the overlying Haisborough Group and younger fine-grained
   strata and is underlain by the Bunter Shale and Zechstein Group. As such
   it appears to be an attractive target for industrial-scale CO2 storage.
   However, the very large masses of CO2 that would have to be injected and
   stored if CCS is to be an effective greenhouse gas mitigation option are
   likely to cause (a) significant pore fluid pressure rise and (b)
   displacement of formation brines from the reservoir. A series of
   reservoir flow simulations of large-scale CO2 injection was carried out
   to investigate these effects. A simple, 3D geocellular model of the
   Bunter Sandstone in the NE part of the UK sector of the Southern North
   Sea was constructed in the TOUGH2 reservoir simulator in which porosity
   and both horizontal and vertical permeability could be varied. The
   injection of CO2 at various rates into the model through a variable
   number of wells for 50 years was simulated and the model was then run
   forward for up to 3000 years to see how pore fluid pressures, brine
   displacement and CO2 distribution evolved. The simulations suggest that
   provided there is good connectivity within the reservoir, and 12
   optimally distributed injection locations are used, 15-20 million tonnes
   of CO2 per year could be stored in the modelled area without the
   reservoir pore pressure exceeding 75\% of the lithostatic pressure
   anywhere within the model. However, significant fluxes of the native
   pore fluid (saline brine) to the sea occurred at a point where the
   Bunter Sandstone crops out at the seabed. This suggests that the
   potential environmental impacts of brine displacement to the sea floor
   should be investigated. The injected CO2 fills only up to about 1\% of
   the total pore space within the model. This indicates that pore fluid
   pressure rise may be a greater constraint on CO2 storage capacity than
   physical containment within the storage reservoir. (C) 2012 Natural

Abstract = {This commentary discusses strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in
   the context of global environmental change and presents a brief overview
   of the science of social-ecological systems and the resilience thinking
   and practices that result from it. Resilience thinking and assessment
   have the potential to make a significant contribution to SEA, if SEA is
   applied (as intended) as a proactive tool for assessing development
   sustainability during the process of making plans, policies, and
   programs. So far, there is little indication that social-ecological
   system (SES) resilience ideas are being applied to SEA, and from a
   complex systems perspective, it seems that cognitive and social biases
   may be the primary barriers to both the improvement of SEA practice and
   the application of SES resilience science to SEA practice. Resilience
   thinking can be integrated into SEA, provided that leadership in the SEA
   community can create a social movement for change in practice and the
   policies that affect SEA procedures. Principles of complexity,
   uncertainty, self-organization, and cooperative problem solving may be
   the most important cognitive barriers to change and can be overcome
   through education and a learning-by-doing approach to the application of
   resilience assessment when appropriate in a SEA process. A deliberate
   change process can be undertaken in an action research approach that
   monitors and adapts the process according to the lessons learned in
   practice. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2018;14:571-577. (c) 2018 SETAC},

Title = {The nature of the beast: examining climate adaptation options in forests
   with stand-replacing fire regimes},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building resilience to natural disturbances is a key to managing forests
   for adaptation to climate change. To date, most climate adaptation
   guidance has focused on recommendations for frequent-fire forests,
   leaving few published guidelines for forests that naturally experience
   infrequent, stand-replacing wildfires. Because most such forests are
   inherently resilient to stand-replacing disturbances, and burn severity
   mosaics are largely indifferent to manipulations of stand structure
   (i.e., weather-driven, rather than fuel-driven fire regimes), we posit
   that pre-fire climate adaptation options are generally fewer in these
   regimes relative to others. Outside of areas of high human value,
   stand-scale fuel treatments commonly emphasized for other forest types
   would undermine many of the functions, ecosystem services, and other
   values for which these forests are known. For stand-replacing
   disturbance regimes, we propose that (1) managed wildfire use (e.g.,
   allowing natural fires to burn under moderate conditions) can be a
   useful strategy as in other forest types, but likely confers fewer
   benefits to long-term forest resilience and climate adaptation, while
   carrying greater socio-ecological risks; (2) reasoned fire exclusion
   (i.e., the suppression component of a managed wildfire program) can be
   an appropriate strategy to maintain certain ecosystem conditions and
   services in the face of change, being more ecologically justifiable in
   long-interval fire regimes and producing fewer of the negative
   consequences than in frequent-fire regimes; (3) low-risk pre-disturbance
   adaptation options are few, but the most promising approaches emphasize
   fundamental conservation biology principles to create a safe operating
   space for the system to respond to change (e.g., maintaining
   heterogeneity across scales and minimizing stressors); and (4)
   post-disturbance conditions are the primary opportunity to implement
   adaptation strategies (such as protecting live tree legacies and testing
   new regeneration methods), providing crucial learning opportunities.
   This approach will provide greater context and understanding of these
   systems for ecologists and resource managers, stimulate future
   development of adaptation strategies, and illustrate why public
   expectations for climate adaptation in these forests will differ from
   those for frequent-fire forests.},

Title = {Urban Overheating Mitigation Strategies Opportunities: A Case Study of a
   Square in Rome (Italy)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is well-known that the occurrence of urban heat islands (UHI) is
   related to climate change and urbanization. Urban locations experience
   local overheating throughout the summer, which is uncomfortable and it
   has a detrimental impact on buildings ability to consume energy. In this
   study, a methodology was developed to assess the urban heat island
   effect in a localized urban area and to evaluate the effects of
   different kind of mitigation strategies. The numerical model was
   developed using the ENVI\_met tool and it was calibrated with weather
   data and albedo measured inside the examined area and near the simulated
   domain. The procedure adopted overtaking the limit of the software in
   reproducing accurate weather conditions without calibration. Finally,
   combination of extensive mitigation strategies (cool pavements,
   greenery, grass pavers) with local strategies (shading) were
   investigated. An experimental and numerical investigation of a square in
   Rome was exanimated to evaluate the possible solution for mitigating
   outdoor air temperatures. Results of the paper affirm that an
   intervention on the pavement albedo and the increase of vegetation
   inside the square, lead to an improvement of the air thermal conditions.
   In particular, the application of the grass pavers would lead to the
   greatest benefits. A maximum decrease in the air temperature of 1.2
   degrees C was obtained through the application of cool material, while
   the reduction reaches up to 2.88 degrees C when a grass paver is
   applied. The improve of the vegetation can bring to a maximum decrease
   of 1.46 degrees C, while the use of shading projecting roof allows a
   reduction up to a maximum of 2.07 degrees C.},

Abstract = {This special issue is devoted to establishing a benchmark database and

   in coastal communities with less than 100,000 people. These coastal
   towns and small cities often have limited information about local
   climate change impacts and typically lack both the financial resources
   and the engineering and planning bases to develop appropriate adaptation
   measures. As a result, much more needs to be done to assist small
   coastal cities and towns to plan and implement adaptation measures. The
   special issue includes six articles in addition to this Introduction: a
   typology for collecting and analysing information; an assessment of
   small island cases; three articles on coastal towns and cities of
   progressively larger populations, and finally a summary of the work and
   suggestions for the way forward in research and application.},

   into Consideration the Effects of Uncertainty},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Multiple changes in marine resources (e.g., abundance, movements,
   distribution, biomass) caused by climate change are critical operational
   risks, leading to production uncertainty for capture fisheries.
   Therefore, risk management measures of coastal and offshore fisheries
   are critical issues in terms of operational sustainability. In this
   study, a questionnaire survey data set collected from fishers was
   analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and a structural
   equation model (SEM) to examine fishers' perceptions and the
   relationships among risk sources, production uncertainty, and adaptation
   measures. The results revealed that significant negative impacts existed
   between risk sources and adaptation measures, which means risk sources
   cannot directly influence risk management measure selection. However,
   production uncertainty could be an important mediator for risk
   management, thus most respondents think that mitigating production
   uncertainty is necessary. Eventually, the results could provide
   managerial implications for the fishery operators, policymakers and the
   government agencies.},

Abstract = {The Vietnamese government, along with country-based non-government
   organisations, are well aware of the vulnerability of Vietnam's coastal
   and low-lying areas to extreme weather events. Yet scant attention has
   been paid to extreme weather hazards affecting Vietnam's northern
   mountainous regions and the livelihoods of ethnic minority farmers
   residing there. Building on conceptual tools from vulnerability, food
   security and sustainable livelihoods literatures, we examine the impacts
   of extreme weather, namely drought and severe cold spells, in Vietnam's
   northern uplands. We explore the degree to which these events impact the
   livelihood portfolios and food security of ethnic minority farmers, and
   examine the coping strategies households initiate, based on their
   ecological knowledge as well as recent market integration initiatives.
   Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with ethnic minority Hmong and Yao
   semi-subsistence households undertaken yearly from 2012 to 2014, we
   demonstrate that financial capital - now more central to households'
   livelihoods than ever before due to state-sponsored agricultural
   intensification - is an important means for farmers to cope with extreme
   weather events. Yet concurrently, longstanding culturally rooted social
   capital, networks and ties remain critical. Nonetheless, short-and
   long-term adaptation is not widespread, leading us to investigate
   possible explanations.},

Title = {Application of Monitoring Network Design and Feedback Information for
   Adaptive Management of Coastal Groundwater Resources},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Optimal strategies for the management of coastal groundwater resources
   can be derived using coupled simulation-optimization based management
   models. However, the management strategy actually implemented on the
   field sometimes deviates from the recommended optimal strategy,
   resulting in field-level deviations. Monitoring these field-level
   deviations during actual implementation of the recommended optimal
   management strategy and sequentially updating the management model using
   the feedback information is an important step towards efficient adaptive
   management of coastal groundwater resources. In this study, a
   three-phase adaptive management framework for a coastal aquifer
   subjected to saltwater intrusion is applied and evaluated for a
   regional-scale coastal aquifer study area. The methodology adopted
   includes three sequential components. First, an optimal management
   strategy (consisting of groundwater extraction from production and
   barrier wells) is derived and implemented forptimal management of the
   aquifer. The implemented management strategy is obtained by solving a
   homogenous ensemble-based coupled simulation-optimization model. Second,
   a regional-scale optimal monitoring network is designed for the aquifer
   system considering possible user noncompliance of a recommended
   management strategy, and uncertainties in estimating aquifer parameters.
   A new monitoring network design objective function is formulated to
   ensure that candidate monitoring wells are placed in high risk (highly
   contaminated) locations. In addition, a new methodology is utilized to
   select candidate monitoring wells in areas representative of the entire
   model domain. Finally, feedback information in the form of measured
   concentrations obtained from the designed optimal monitoring wells is
   used to sequentially modify pumping strategies for future time periods
   in the management horizon. The developed adaptive management framework
   is evaluated by applying it to the Bonriki aquifer system located in
   Kiribati, which is a small developing island country in the South
   Pacific region. Overall, the results from this study suggest that the
   implemented adaptive management strategy has the potential to address
   important practical implementation issues arising due to noncompliance
   of an optimal management strategy and uncertain aquifer parameters.},

Abstract = {Within the adaptive co-management field, evaluation has been receiving
   increased attention over the last 10years. Although monitoring and
   evaluation are integral components of adaptive co-management, they are
   sometimes weakly incorporated. Participatory evaluation could play a
   role in embedding monitoring and evaluation more strongly, but there is
   very little empirical research about its outcomes and implications for
   adaptive co-management. Small-scale fisheries in Uruguay were used as
   case study as they are going through a governance transition; local
   multistakeholder councils have been formed to look for solutions to
   fishery-related problems in a collective manner. In one of these
   councils, we facilitated a participatory evaluation process with
   involvement of the four stakeholder groups (fishers, fisheries agency,
   coast guard and local governments). The objective was to investigate the
   potential of participatory evaluation for enhancing the two main pillars
   of adaptive co-management: collaboration and learning. Findings from
   interviews with workshop participants show that cooperation and
   communication among stakeholders were enhanced. However, trust only
   increased between some stakeholders, and existing conflicts were not
   resolved. The evaluation workshops became a learning space and
   stakeholders improved their skills to participate and interact with
   different actors. An important outcome was a series of operational
   agreements for the council, to overcome the weaknesses and challenges
   that the council was facing. Learning is crucial in the initial stage of
   an adaptive co-management process (and throughout it). The implications
   of the study are discussed in light of the scholarship on adaptive
   co-management, transdisciplinary research and sustainability science.},

Abstract = {Like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Mauritius is highly
   vulnerable to the impacts of Climate Change (CC) and Climate Variability
   (CV). Particularly vulnerable are small-scale farmers who carry out
   rain-fed agriculture. While adaptation to CC and CV has taken place
   among small planters, the first methodological assessment of the
   technology needs for adaptation in the agriculture sector took place in
   Phase II of the global GEF-UNEP Technology Needs Assessment (TNA)
   project. In addition to providing a systematic approach for identifying
   and prioritizing adaptation technologies, the TNA project also sought to
   increase the preparedness of Mauritius for leveraging international
   climate financing and support for technology transfer. Since Mauritius
   was the only SIDS participating in Phase II of the TNA project, this
   chapter shares with other SIDS the methodology and lessons learned. The
   climate change-agriculture-food security nexus is also discussed.

   flood flows and sea level rises are accounted for in long term strategic
   planning processes to adapt inland and coastal flood risk management in
   England to climate change. Combining key informant interviews (n = 18)
   with documentary analysis, it explores the institutional tensions
   between adaptive management approaches emphasising openness to
   uncertainty and to alternative policy options on the one hand and
   risk-based ones that close them down by transforming uncertainties into
   calculable risks whose management can be rationalized through
   cost-benefit analysis and nationally consistent, risk-based priority
   setting on the other hand. These alternative approaches to managing
   uncertainty about the first-order risks to society from future flooding
   are shaped by institutional concerns with managing the second-order,
   `institutional' risks of criticism and blame arising from accountability
   for discharging those first-order risk management responsibilities. In
   the case of river flooding the poorly understood impacts of future
   climate change were represented with a simplistic adjustment to peak
   flow estimates, which proved robust in overcoming institutional
   resistance to making precautionary allowances for climate change in
   risk-based flood management, at least in part because its scientific
   limitations were acknowledged only partially. By contrast in the case of
   coastal flood risk management, greater scientific confidence led to
   successively more elaborate guidance on how to represent the science,
   which in turn led to inconsistency in implementation and increased the
   institutional risks involved in taking the uncertain effects of future
   sea level rise into account in adaptation planning and flood risk
   management. Comparative analysis of these two cases then informs some
   wider reflections about the tensions between adaptive and risk-based
   approaches, the role of institutional risk in climate change adaptation,
   and the importance of such institutional dynamics in shaping the framing
   uncertainties and policy responses to scientific knowledge about them.

   An economic resiliency strategy was developed that builds resilience
   through improved household assets to reduce risks and vulnerabilities. A
   foundational conclusion of the strategy is the importance of linking
   household livelihood interventions to sustainable fishing behaviors. The
   conservation enterprise approach facilitated a mutually beneficial

Abstract = {Most studies on natural disasters have focused on physical and
   psychological health consequences or risk perception, paying little
   attention to variables associated with bonds to place. In order to study
   these types of variable, 265 people from different towns on the island
   of El Hierro (Canary Islands, Spain) were interviewed individually
   during the volcanic process that took place on the island between
   September and December 2011. This interview set out to assess the
   emotions they experienced, the coping strategies they used and the
   changes in place attachment, place identity and perceived
   restorativeness. Levels of fear, anger, loss and active confrontation
   were higher in the town nearest the volcanic process than in other towns
   on the island. A greater impact on the perceived restorativeness of
   place and place attachment also occurred in this town. Multiple
   regression analysis revealed that changes in place attachment are
   related to feelings of loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {High-resolution seasonal and decadal inventory of anthropogenic
   gas-phase and particle emissions for Argentina},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA},

Pages = {5027-5069},

Abstract = {This work presents the integration of a gas-phase and particulate
   atmospheric emission inventory (AEI) for Argentina in high spatial
   resolution (0.025 degrees x0.025 degrees; approx. 2.5 km x 2.5 km)
   considering monthly variability from 1995 to 2020. The new inventory,
   called GEAA-AEIv3.0M, includes the following activities: energy
   production, fugitive emissions from oil and gas production, industrial
   fuel consumption and production, transport (road, maritime, and air),
   agriculture, livestock production, manufacturing, residential,
   commercial, and biomass and agricultural waste burning. The following
   species, grouped by atmospheric reactivity, are considered: (i)
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) - CO2, CH4, and N2O; (ii) ozone precursors - CO,
   NOx (NO+NO2), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs); (iii)
   acidifying gases - NH3 and SO2; and (iv) particulate matter (PM) - PM10,
   PM2.5, total suspended particles (TSPs), and black carbon (BC). The main
   objective of the GEAA-AEIv3.0M high-resolution emission inventory is to
   provide temporally resolved emission maps to support air quality and
   climate modeling oriented to evaluate pollutant mitigation strategies by
   local governments. This is of major concern, especially in countries
   where air quality monitoring networks are scarce, and the development of
   regional and seasonal emissions inventories would result in remarkable
   improvements in the time and space chemical prediction achieved by air
   quality models.
   Despite distinguishing among different sectoral and activity databases
   as well as introducing a novel spatial distribution approach based on
   census radii, our high-resolution GEAA-AEIv3.0M shows equivalent
   national-wide total emissions compared to the Third National
   Communication of Argentina (TNCA), which compiles annual GHG emissions
   from 1990 through 2014 (agreement within +/- 7.5 \%). However, the
   GEAA-AEIv3.0M includes acidifying gases and PM species not considered in
   TNCA. Temporal comparisons were also performed against two international
   databases: Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) and EDGAR HTAPv5.0 for
   several pollutants; for EDGAR it also includes a spatial comparison.
   The agreement was acceptable within less than 30 \% for most of the
   pollutants and activities, although a >90 \% discrepancy was obtained
   for methane from fuel production and fugitive emissions and >120 \% for
   biomass burning. Finally, the updated seasonal series clearly showed the
   pollution reduction due to the COVID-19 lockdown during the first
   quarter of year 2020 with respect to same months in previous years.
   Through an open-access data repository, we present the GEAA-AEIv3.0M
   inventory as the largest and more detailed spatial resolution dataset
   for the Argentine Republic, which includes monthly gridded emissions for
   12 species and 15 stors between 1995 and 2020.},

   Languedoc-Roussillon, France},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {26-34},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise due to climate change creates new risks of submersion in
   coastal areas that must be taken into account. Although these are
   long-term risks for 2100, it is important to anticipate possible
   consequences in order to identify the most vulnerable areas or issues
   and develop the appropriate adaptation policies. The aim of this paper
   is to examine the consequences of such sea-level rise for wetlands in
   the Languedoc-Roussillon region (France) which is particularly at risk
   of submersion. The analysis is based on the worst case scenario of a one
   meter sea level rise by 2100, with a variety of adaptive strategies:
   denial, laissez-faire and strategic retreat of infrastructure and
   buildings. This latter strategy assumes that the retreat wetlands is
   unconstrained. The evaluation examines the losses and transformations of
   ecological habitats, depending on their distance from salt water.
   Estimating damages and benefits requires first, to study the evolution
   of the services supplied by different habitats and second, to estimate
   the value of the economic impact. This approach demonstrates the
   superiority of a strategic retreat policy which would halve the damages
   resulting from submersion. (C) 2016 Elsevier. Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate engineering to mitigate the projected 21st-century terrestrial
   drying of the Americas: a direct comparison of carbon capture and sulfur
   injection},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},

Abstract = {To mitigate the projected global warming in the 21st century, it is
   well-recognized that society needs to cut CO2 emissions and other
   short-lived warming agents aggressively. However, to stabilize the
   climate at a warming level closer to the present day, such as the ``well
   below 2 degrees C{''} aspiration in the Paris Agreement, a net-zero
   carbon emission by 2050 is still insufficient. The recent IPCC special
   report calls for a massive scheme to extract CO2 directly from the
   atmosphere, in addition to decarbonization, to reach negative net
   emissions at the mid-century mark. Another ambitious proposal is
   solar-radiation-based geoengineering schemes, including injecting sulfur
   gas into the stratosphere. Despite being in public debate for years,
   these two leading geoengineering schemes have not been directly compared
   under a consistent analytical framework using global climate models.
   Here we present the first explicit analysis of the hydroclimate impacts
   of these two geoengineering approaches using two recently available
   large-ensemble (>10 members) model experiments conducted by a family of
   state-of-the-art Earth system models. The CO2-based mitigation
   simulation is designed to include both emission cuts and carbon capture.
   The solar-radiation-based mitigation simulation is designed to inject
   sulfur gas strategically at specified altitudes and latitudes and run a
   feedback control algorithm to avoid common problems previously
   identified such as the overcooling of the tropics and large-scale
   precipitation shifts.
   Our analysis focuses on the projected aridity conditions over the
   Americas in the 21st century in detailed terms of the potential
   mitigation benefits, the temporal evolution, the spatial distribution
   (within North and South America), the relative efficiency, and the
   physical mechanisms. We show that sulfur injection, in contrast to
   previous notions of leading to excessive terrestrial drying (in terms of
   precipitation reduction) while offsetting the global mean greenhouse gas
   (GHG) warming, will instead mitigate the projected drying tendency under
   RCP8.5. The surface energy balance change induced by sulfur injection,
   in addition to the well-known response in temperature and precipitation,
   plays a crucial role in determining the overall terrestrial hydroclimate
   response.
   However, when normalized by the same amount of avoided global warming in
   these simulations, sulfur injection is less effective in curbing the
   worsening trend of regional land aridity in the Americas under RCP8.5
   when compared with carbon capture. Temporally, the climate benefit of
   sulfur injection will emerge more quickly, even when both schemes are
   hypothetically started in the same year of 2020. Spatially, both schemes
   are effective in curbing the drying trend over North America. However,
   for South America, the sulfur injection scheme is particularly more
   effective for the sub-Amazon region (southern Brazil), while the carbon
   capture scheme is more effective for the Amazon region. We conclude that
   despite the apparent limitations (such as an inability to address ocean
   acidification) and potential side effects (such as changes to the ozone
   layer), innovative means of sulfur injection should continue to be
   explored as a potential low-cost option in the climate solution toolbox,
   complementing other mitigation approaches such as emission cuts and
   carbon capture (Cao et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate the urgent
   need for multi-model comparison studies and detailed regional
   assessments in other parts of the world.},

Title = {Building climate change resilience through bottom-up adaptation to flood
   risk in Warri, Nigeria},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {139-160},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The problem of flooding in Warri, Nigeria is as old as the city itself.
   What has changed in recent years is the rapidly increasing magnitude and
   frequency of floodwater retention pools on urban streets as urban
   development expanded into low-lying swamplands within the city. Through
   the process of community urban risk assessments, urban flood zone
   occupants acknowledge the growing problem of on-street flood retention
   pools in a city once dominated by problems with off-street flood
   retention pools. A factor analysis of the perceived causes of flooding
   shows that Warri residents believe that human activities that reduced
   the floodwater storage capacity of its natural drainage sinks (i.e., its
   swamplands), violated building codes, changed local water levels,
   altered low-lying mangrove swamp terrain, and eliminated drainage
   facilities are responsible for the increasing retention of floodwater
   pools on city streets in the last few decades. Such local stock of flood
   knowledge has implications for a local participatory approach to
   community adaptations and mitigation methods to reduce urban flood risks
   from climate change and uncontrolled urban expansion. Local community
   adaptation choices guide how flood-affected residents cope with urban
   floods, especially how they use and alter their living space and respond
   to emergencies. However, such community views are often ignored by
   experts seeking solutions to flooding. If the views of flood zone
   occupants begin to inform flood adaptation choices, proposed solutions
   to flooding problems would be more likely to receive local support and
   acceptance, thus making the bottom-up solutions developed in this paper
   easier to implement and sustain. Once a well-formulated grassroots
   adaptation strategy for urban flood risk management for resiliency
   becomes the base for action, a more resilient national policy is sure to
   succeed, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries
   where informal settlement is the case and the role of government in
   flood management is still minimal.},

Volume = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Size-based food-web models, which focus on body size rather than species
   identity, capture the generalist and transient feeding interactions in
   most marine ecosystems and are well-supported by data. Here, we develop
   a size-based model that incorporates dynamic interactions between marine
   benthic (detritus-based) and pelagic (primary producer based) pathways
   to investigate how the coupling of these pathways affects food web
   stability and resilience. All model configurations produced stable
   steady-state size spectra. Resilience was measured by the return speed
   obtained from local stability analysis. Return times following large
   perturbations away from steady-state were also measured. Resilience
   varied nonlinearly with both predator and detrital coupling, and high
   resilience came from predators (1) feeding entirely in the slow benthic
   zone or (2) feeding across the two energy pathways, with most food
   coming from the fast pelagic pathway. When most of the energy flowed
   through the pelagic pathway, resilience was positively related to
   turnover rate. When most of the energy flowed through the benthic
   pathway, resilience was negatively related to turnover rate. Analysis of
   the effects of large perturbations revealed that resilience for pelagic
   ecosystems depended on the nature of the perturbation and the degree of
   benthic-pelagic coupling. Areas with very little or no benthic-pelagic
   coupling (e.g. deep seas or highly stratified water columns) may return
   more quickly following pulses of detrital fallout or primary production
   but could be much less resilient to the effects of human-induced
   mortality (harvesting).},

Abstract = {It is predicted that climate change will result in rising sea levels,
   more frequent and extreme weather events, hotter and drier summers and
   warmer and wetter winters. This will have a significant impact on the
   design of buildings, how they are kept cool and how they are weathered
   against more extreme climatic conditions. The residential sector is
   already a significant environmental burden with high associated
   operational energy. Climate change, and a growing population requiring
   residence, has the potential to exacerbate this problem seriously. New
   paradigms for residential building design are required to enable
   low-carbon dioxide operation to mitigate climate change. They must also
   face the reality of inevitable climate change and adopt climate change
   adaptation strategies to cope with future scenarios. However, any
   climate adaptation strategy for dwellings must also be cognisant of
   adapting occupant needs, influenced by ageing populations and new
   technologies. This paper presents concepts and priorities for changing
   how society designs residential buildings by designing for adaptation. A
   case study home is analysed in the context of its stated aims of low
   energy and adaptability. A post-occupancy evaluation of the house is
   presented, and future-proofing strategies are evaluated using climate
   projection data for future climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {The requirement for using a participatory approach to consider options
   for adapting to climate change is well documented, but there are some
   key challenges of engaging with communities, especially over the
   complexities of projected climate change impacts and possible adaptation
   options. Here we describe the development of a two-stage method aimed to
   overcome these challenges, and the testing of this method in a coastal
   community in Whitianga on the Coromandel Peninsula, North Island of New
   Zealand. First, at an Open Day we used projections of sea-level rise
   driven changes to coastal inundation, erosion and habitat change and
   mapped them on large aerial-photo maps to use as the basis for a
   participatory mapping exercise. The purpose of the Open Day was to
   elicit input on valued aspects of the Whitianga community that might be
   at threat from climate change. Second, at a follow-up Workshop we worked
   with the community to explore the potential for adaptation options to
   provide `solutions' to these issues, exploring who the winners and
   losers would be for each option, and what would be required to enable
   the options to be actioned. The maps were a key tool in this engagement
   case-study, and we reflect on them in our discussion of their
   development and usefulness. Finally we summarise the lessons learned in
   this case study and describe four key inputs to successful community
   engagement: the right team, the right data, the right support, and the
   right resources.},

Title = {GIS assessment of coastal vulnerability to climate change and coastal
   adaption planning in Vietnam},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-36},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Vietnam's coastal zone provides a diverse range of natural resources and
   favourable conditions for social and economic development. However, its
   coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable, due to several natural coastal
   hazards, over-exploitation and other human activities. In spite of
   diverse interventions, Vietnam's coastal zone continues to experience
   significant damage from floods, erosion and typhoons. These hazards are
   being intensified by climate change and associated rising sea levels.
   This paper assesses the potential vulnerability of Vietnam's coast to
   climate change and discusses possible adaptation policies and plan to
   reduce the impacts. GIS analysis was used for the assessment of coastal
   vulnerability. Related literature was reviewed to develop detailed
   understanding of coastal adaptation to climate change. Adaptation
   policies and plans were appraised to identify potential coastal
   adaptation policies and plans that could be adapted by Vietnam. It was
   identified that vulnerability of the coastal zone of Vietnam could not
   be attributed only to climatic factors, but also to the physical
   condition of the coastline. Much of Vietnam's coastline, particularly,
   areas around the Red River delta and the Mekong River have elevations
   below 1 m. These coastlines are largely developed and serve as economic
   centres of the country, which makes the coast more vulnerable to climate
   change and the rising sea level. The paper concluded that a
   non-structural approach (coastal buffer zones, building houses on
   stilts, storm warning systems, growing of flood-resistant crops and
   elevated storm shelters with medicine and food storage) could be used by
   Vietnam to adapt her low-lying coastline around the two deltas to
   climate change as this strategy enables vulnerable areas to be occupied
   for longer before eventual retreat. However, for these policies to be
   successful, it should be planned, implemented well in advance, monitored
   and evaluated over time.},

   The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of heat stress
   mitigation strategies by proposing a new heat stress risk index that
   comprehensively accounts for hazard, vulnerability and exposure of the
   urban context. The index is tested with the assessment of two different
   greenery scenarios based on the introduction of vegetation in the
   existing street spaces rearranged according to the principles of traffic
   calming and vertical vegetated surfaces. These scenarios have been
   simulated in a district of the metropolitan city of Catania (Italy)
   through the combined use of GIS software and Computational Fluid
   Dynamics (CFD) simulations in ENVI-met.
   Results showed that mitigation scenarios improve outdoor thermal
   conditions for pedestrians because about 66\% of the domain area showed
   T-mrt reductions in the range of 2.5 degrees C-7.5 degrees C with
   respect to the existing scenario. Furthermore, the no hazard area for
   80(+) residents is increased from 63\% of current scenario to 83\% of
   the advanced scenario, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the new
   index in giving a synthetic measure of effectiveness to decision makers.
   Further studies are planned to stress the capabilities of the index in
   contrasting heat stress risk and mitigation solutions for different
   urban tissues and climates.},

Title = {Economic impacts of climate change and climate change adaptation
   strategies in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Abstract = {The fisheries sectors in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste are important sources
   of food and income. Similar to other developing countries and those in
   the Pacific, they are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change more
   so because of their geographic location, socioeconomic conditions and
   political instability. Nonetheless, there are approaches to alleviate
   the damaging effects of climate change in the region's fisheries sector.
   Using economic modeling, this paper estimates the economic costs of
   potential climate change adaptation strategies for the fisheries sector
   in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste through assessment of alternative future
   scenarios. Strategies include aquaculture development, natural resource
   management through establishment and/or expansion of marine protected
   areas, and deployment of low-cost inshore fish aggregating devices.
   Modeling results demonstrate that the above innovations will enable the
   two countries to significantly improve coastal and freshwater fish
   production in the medium-term (2035) and long-term (2050). Fish
   consumption is projected to grow due to population and income
   improvements; yet considerable increases in production will augment
   demand. Furthermore, national-level gains are projected from these
   adaptation strategies through fish exports. Improved production under
   climate change will require significant investments from the national
   governments of Vanuatu and Timor-Leste and/or private sectors. (C) 2015

Abstract = {With accelerating climate change, US coastal communities are
   experiencing increased flood risk intensity, resulting from accelerated
   sea level rise and stronger storms. These conditions place pressure on
   municipalities and local residents to consider a range of new disaster
   risk reduction programs, climate resilience initiatives, and in some
   cases transformative adaptation strategies (e.g., managed retreat and
   relocation from highly vulnerable, low-elevation locations). Researchers
   have increasingly understood that these climate risks and adaptation
   actions have significant impacts on the quality of life, well-being, and
   mental health of urban coastal residents. We explore these relationships
   and define conditions under which adaptation practices will affect
   communities and residents. Specifically, we assess climate and
   environmental stressors, community change, and well-being by utilizing
   the growing climate change literature and the parallel social science
   literature on risk and hazards, environmental psychology, and urban
   geography work, heretofore not widely integrated into work on climate
   adaptation.},

Title = {Institutional Innovation for Nature-Based Coastal Adaptation: Lessons
   from Salt Marsh Restoration in Nova Scotia, Canada},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sea-levels have been rising at a faster rate than expected. Because of
   the maladaptive outcomes of engineering-based hard coastal protection
   infrastructure, policy makers are looking for alternative adaptation
   approaches to buffer against coastal flooding commonly known as
   nature-based coastal adaptation (NbCA). However, how to implement NbCA
   under an institutional structure demonstrating `inertia' to alternative
   adaptation approaches is a question that seeks scientific attention.
   Building on a case study derived from a highly climate-vulnerable
   Canadian province, this study shows how the entrepreneurial use of
   scientific information and institutional opportunities helped
   institutional actors overcome the inertia. Drawing on secondary document
   analysis and primary qualitative data, this study offers five key
   lessons to institutional actors aiming at implementing NbCA: (i) develop
   knowledge networks to help avoid uncertainty; (ii) identify and utilize
   opportunities within existing institutions; (iii) distribute roles and
   responsibilities among actors based on their capacity to mobilize
   required resources; (iv) provide entrepreneurial actors with
   decision-making autonomy for developing agreed-upon rules and norms; and
   (v) facilitate repeated interactions among institutional actors to
   develop a collaborative network among them. This study, therefore, helps
   us to understand how to implement a relatively new adaptation option by
   building trust-based networks among diverse and relevant institutional
   actors.},

Title = {Synergies and trade-offs for climate-resilient agriculture in India: an

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {164},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Globally, agriculture is recognized as a highly vulnerable sector to
   climate change and risks from climatic aberrations pose an imminent
   danger to the food security and sustainability of livelihoods. To bring
   robustness in climate adaptation planning, evaluation of resilience
   across homogenous regions is essential for developing and scaling
   suitable location-need-context specific interventions and policies that
   build the resilience of the agricultural system. In this paper, we
   present an analysis and discussion of multi-scalar and multi-indicator
   assessment, by profiling resilience across agro-climatic zones of India,
   based on the development of a Climate-Resilient Agriculture Index
   embracing environmental, technological, socio-economic, and
   institutional and infrastructural dimension. A total of 26 indicators,
   spread across these four dimensions, were employed to purport inter- and
   intra-agro-climatic zone differentials in the level of resilience. Among
   the zones, it was found that West Coast Plains \& Ghats and
   Tans-Gangetic Plains had the highest degree of resilience to manage
   climate risks. Most of the districts lying within Eastern Himalayan
   Region, Middle Gangetic Plains, Eastern Plateau \& Hills, and Western
   Dry Region had a lower degree of resilience. The study places greater
   emphasis on deciphering region-specific drivers and barriers to
   resilience at a further disaggregated scale for improving rural
   well-beings. It is construed that devising action plans emphasizing
   awareness, preservation of natural resources, diversification, building
   physical infrastructure, strengthening of grass-root institutions, and
   mainstreaming climate adaptation in the developmental policy is crucial
   for climate-resilient pathways.},

Abstract = {Cities and urban systems are the places most responsible for climate
   change, but at the same time they are the places where its effects are
   felt the most. A state-of-the-art analysis showed that
   Ecological-Environmental, Settlement, and Infrastructure and Service
   Systems are the components of cities most exposed to risk phenomena.
   Therefore, it is important to identify site-specific actions aimed at
   enhancing ecosystem services and building hierarchical ecological
   networks (green and blue infrastructures), according to an
   Ecosystem-based Approach (EbA). In this regard, the contribution
   presents the results of a research work on the theme of multi-risks
   connected to climate change, referring to heavy rains and river flood
   phenomena and sea level rise and proposes a systematisation of
   international best practices in the field of the Ecosystem-based
   Approach (EbA). Each best practice analysed is traced back to the three
   urban resilience macro-strategies of ``defence{''}, ``adaptation{''},
   and ``relocation/de-anthropisation{''}, already conceptualised by the
   authors during their joint research activity. The aim is to outline a
   synthetic toolkit of site-specific design actions, exportable to other
   contexts, intended as a tool to support the innovation of urban planning
   tools at the local level.},

Abstract = {This paper reports research into adaptation to climate change for
   regional tourism destinations. It explains the application of a regional
   tourism adaptation framework model to the Surf Coast destination, within
   the state of Victoria, Australia. It then examines the usefulness of the
   framework model in guiding a vulnerability resilience assessment of the
   destination and developing strategies to increase the destinations
   resilience, resistance and readiness. A Delphi study was conducted,
   using a panel of experts, to determine the major risks and opportunities
   for tourism in the region as well as appropriate adaptation options.
   Although many of the findings focused on the best way to manage the
   negative bio-physical impacts of climate change, such as increased
   bushfire risk or more frequent and intense storms, several opportunities
   also became apparent including the potential to reduce seasonality.
   Tourism destination management is already a complex area and the
   introduction of climate change provides yet another challenge for
   managers and policy-makers. Consequently, the development and use of a
   regional adaptation framework can play an important role in assisting
   destination planning and management.},

Abstract = {Climate change has been occurring in every part of the world for the
   last two decades, including Indonesia. This phenomenon constitutes key
   emerging threat to marine ecosystems and fisheries resources as well as
   to societies that depend on these coastal environment and natural
   resources for food and livelihood. Nowadays, coastal adaptation to
   climate change is one of the tremendous challenges for coastal
   communities. The east coast of Sidoarjo regency has one of the widest
   mudflat areas in East Java, with high sedimentation rate which is
   originated from Brantas Watershed. This area, specifically in Kepetingan
   Hamlet, Sawohan Village, is heavily impacted by tidal floods twice a
   year and this is considered the most vulnerable place in Sidoarjo
   coastal area. In terms of a climate change adaptation measures, it is
   important to assess the resilience of these communities. This research
   aimed to analyse the recent condition of Kepetingan Hamlet and to
   investigate the factors which increases local community vulnerability
   due to climate change impact. We conducted this research by undergoing
   field observations including interviews with related stakeholders. This
   result expected to provide a bigger picture about Kepetingan Hamlet and
   to provide the suitable adaptation strategies for building resilience in
   facing climate change.},

Title = {Pitfalls in developing coastal climate adaptation responses},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {1-8},
Abstract = {Increasing awareness of the risks to coastal communities and
   infrastructure posed by sea level rise and possible climate-induced
   changes to the frequency and intensity of catchment flooding events have
   triggered a large number of studies that have assessed the risk, and
   developed a prioritisation of actions. These prioritised action
   recommendations are typically encapsulated in climate adaptation plans
   and pathways documents, risk reduction strategies, and climate action
   plans. These studies typically involve a vulnerability assessment task
   and an action prioritisation task, often performed in the same study.
   Most of the focus on research and method development over recent decades
   has been on the first task that aims to quantify the vulnerability of
   coastal communities and infrastructure. It is argued here that as a
   result of this emphasis on assessing vulnerability, at the cost of
   adequate consideration of response actions, along with the linear ` fix
   and forget' management approach to climate adaptation, has led to a lack
   of uptake in coastal climate adaptation studies and strategies. To this
   end the aim of the work presented here is to highlight common shortfalls
   in this fix and forget approach and in particular in the response
   prioritisation task. Ways that these shortfalls can be avoided, based on
   knowledge from decision theory, are presented. (C) 2015 The Author.

Abstract = {Overheated outdoor environments adversely impact urban sustainability
   and livability. Urban areas are particularly affected by heat waves and
   global climate change, which is a serious threat due to increasing heat
   stress and thermal risk for residents. The tropical city of Darwin,
   Australia, for example, is especially susceptible to urban overheating
   that can kill inhabitants. Here, using a modeling platform supported by
   detailed measurements of meteorological data, we report the first
   quantified analysis of the urban microclimate and evaluate the impacts
   of heat mitigation technologies to decrease the ambient temperature in
   the city of Darwin. We present a holistic study that quantifies the
   benefits of city-scale heat mitigation to human health, energy
   consumption, and peak electricity demand. The best-performing mitigation
   scenario, which combines cool materials, shading, and greenery, reduces
   the peak ambient temperature by 2.7 degrees C and consequently decreases
   the peak electricity demand and the total annual cooling load by 2\% and
   7.2\%, respectively. Further, the proposed heat mitigation approach can
   save 9.66 excess deaths per year per 100,000 people within the Darwin
   urban health district. Our results confirm the technological
   possibilities for urban heat mitigation, which serves as a strategy for
   mitigating the severity of cumulative threats to urban sustainability.},

   participants used an interactive aid to evaluate moving to a coastal
   community described as having a policy of Resilience or Adaptation, or
   having No Stated Policy. In Study 1, both groups judged the threat of

Abstract = {The absence of vegetation in urban areas contributes to the
   establishment of the urban heat island, markedly increasing thermal
   stress for residents, driving morbidity and mortality. Mitigation
   strategies are, therefore, needed to reduce urban heat, particularly
   against a background of urbanization, anthropogenic warming and
   increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves. In this Review, we
   evaluate the potential of green infrastructure as a mitigation strategy,
   focusing on greenery on the ground (parks) and greenery on buildings
   (green roofs and green walls). Green infrastructure acts to cool the
   urban environment through shade provision and evapotranspiration.
   Typically, greenery on the ground reduces peak surface temperature by
   2-9 degrees C, while green roofs and green walls reduce surface
   temperature by similar to 17 degrees C, also providing added thermal
   insulation for the building envelope. However, the cooling potential
   varies markedly, depending on the scale of interest (city or building
   level), greenery extent (park shape and size), plant selection and plant
   placement. Urban planners must, therefore, optimize design to maximize
   mitigation benefits, for example, by interspersing parks throughout a
   city, allocating more trees than lawn space and using multiple
   strategies in areas where most cooling is required. To do so, improved
   translation of scientific understanding to practical design guidelines
   is needed.},

Title = {Changes in soil carbon sequestration and soil respiration following

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aims
   Although many studies have reported net gains of soil organic carbon
   (SOC) after afforestation on croplands, this is uncertain for Chinese
   paddy rice croplands. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of
   afforestation of paddy rice croplands on SOC sequestration and soil
   respiration (R-s). Such knowledge would improve our understanding of the
   effectiveness of various land use options on greenhouse gas mitigation
   in China.
   Methods
   The investigation was conducted on the Chongming Island, north
   subtropical China. Field sites were reclaimed from coastal salt marshes
   in the 1960s, and soils were homogeneous with simple land use histories.
   SOC stocks and R-s levels were monitored over one year in a paddy rice
   cropland, an evergreen and a deciduous broad-leaved plantation
   established on previous paddy fields and a reference fallow land site
   never cultivated. Laboratory incubation of soil under fast-changing
   temperatures was used to compare the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of
   SOC decomposition across land uses.
   Important Findings
   After 15-20 years of afforestation on paddy fields, SOC concentration
   only slightly increased at the depth of 0-5 cm but decreased in deeper
   layers, which resulted in a net loss of SOC stock in the top 40 cm.
   Seasonal increase of SOC was observed during the rice-growing period in
   croplands but not in afforested soils, suggesting a stronger SOC
   sequestration by paddy rice cropping. However, SOC sequestered under
   cropping was more labile, as indicated by its higher contents of
   dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass. Also, paddy soils had
   higher annual R-s than afforested soils; R-s abruptly increased after
   paddy fields were drained and plowed and remained distinctively high
   throughout the dry farming period. Laboratory incubation revealed that
   paddy soils had a much higher Q(10) of SOC decomposition than afforested
   soils.. Given that temperature was the primary controller of R-s in this
   region, it was concluded that despite the stronger SOC sequestration by
   paddy rice cropping, its SOC was less stable than in afforested systems
   and might be more easily released into the atmosphere under global
   warming.},

Title = {Development of a participatory approach for mapping climate risks and
   adaptive interventions (CS-MAP) in Vietnam's Mekong River Delta},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {59-70},
Abstract = {The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 2016 adversely affected
   Vietnam particularly in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), where more than
   90\% of the country's rice export is produced annually. During that
   time, salinity intrusion and drought significantly affected agricultural
   production in the area. Furthermore, flooding is another recurring event
   in the area that is increasing in frequency. An assessment conducted by
   CGIAR Centers showed that even as warnings were provided by the
   government for the 2016 ENSO, these were not translated into appropriate
   preparations and responsive actions for agriculture. To address this
   critical issue, the Department of Crop Production (DCP) of the Ministry
   of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) of Vietnam, and CGIAR
   Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security in
   Southeast Asia (CCAFS-SEA) collaborated to develop and test an
   participatory approach for mapping climate risks and adaptive
   interventions (CS-MAP) to recognize climate-related risks, identify
   potentially affected areas and develop regional and provincial
   adaptation plans for rice production. The CS-MAP is a participatory
   approach involving experts from various local and national offices for:
   (1) identifying climate-related risks; (2) delineating affected areas
   and risk levels; (3) proposing corresponding adaptive plans; (4) fine
   tuning and verifying proposed measures; and (5) developing integrated
   provincial and regional adaptation plans. Risks and adaptive
   interventions maps were developed for normal and ENSO years by using
   technical data (i.e. topography and hydrology), infrastructures (i.e.
   dikes, road and canals), and local observations. CS-MAP is now is under
   various stages of development and implementation in 13 MRD provinces
   highlighting the organizational uptake and integration of the approach.},

Abstract = {Economic resilience is a critical indicator of the sustainable
   development of an urban economy. This paper measures the urban economic
   resilience (UER) of 286 major cities in China from six
   indicatorseconomic growth, opening up, social development, environmental
   protection, natural conditions, and technological innovationusing a
   subjective and objective weighting method and the Technique for Order of
   Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods.
   Furthermore, kernel density estimation (KDE) was used to reveal the
   spatial and temporal trends in UER across cities, and a social
   opportunity function was applied to access the opportunity for economic
   resilience and the fairness of opportunities for economic resilience in
   19 urban agglomerations in China. The results show that the UER was, in
   general, low across all cities but increased over time. Geographically,
   the UER disperses from the eastern coast to inland cities. Amongst urban
   agglomerations in China, the economic resilience opportunity index also
   varies spatially and increases over time. On the other hand, the
   opportunity fairness index of UER remained largely stable and
   substantial inequalities exist across all urban agglomerations,
   indicating the need for differentiated policy intervention to ensure
   equality and the sustainable development of the region. The methodology
   developed in this research can also be applied in other cities and
   regions to test its re-applicability and to understand the UER in
   different contexts.},

Abstract = {Adaptive management implies a continuous knowledge-based decision-making
   process in conservation. Yet, the coupling of scientific monitoring and
   management frameworks remains rare in practice because formal and
   informal communication pathways are lacking. We examined 4 cases in
   Micronesia where conservation practitioners are using new knowledge in
   the form of monitoring data to advance marine conservation. These cases
   were drawn from projects in Micronesia Challenge jurisdictions that
   received funding for coupled monitoring-to-management frameworks and
   encompassed all segments of adaptive management. Monitoring in Helen
   Reef, Republic of Palau, was catalyzed by coral bleaching and revealed
   evidence of overfishing that led to increased enforcement and outreach.
   In Nimpal Channel, Yap, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), monitoring
   the recovery of marine food resources after customary restrictions were
   put in place led to new, more effective enforcement approaches.
   Monitoring in Laolao Bay, Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
   Islands, was catalyzed by observable sediment loads from poor land-use
   practices and resulted in actions that reduced land-based threats,
   particularly littering and illegal burning, and revealed additional
   threats from overfishing. Pohnpei (FSM) began monitoring after observed
   declines in grouper spawning aggregations. This data led to adjusting
   marine conservation area boundaries and implementing market-based size
   class restrictions. Two themes emerged from these cases. First, in each
   case monitoring was conducted in a manner relevant to the social and
   ecological systems and integrated into the decision-making process.
   Second, conservation practitioners and scientists in these cases
   integrated culturally appropriate stakeholder engagement throughout all
   phases of the adaptive management cycle. More broadly, our study
   suggests, when describing adaptive management, providing more details on
   how monitoring and management activities are linked at similar spatial
   scales and across similar time frames can enhance the application of
   knowledge.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Abstract = {The impacts of sea level rise under a changing climate negatively affect
   the world's coastal zones and threaten livelihood opportunities of the
   dependent communities, thereby highlighting the need for improved
   coastal adaptation strategies. The study employed a two-step methodology
   (i.e. bibliometric and systematic review) to analyse the geospatiality
   of sea level rise impacts and communities' adaptation. In total, 363
   papers were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases, and 292
   were considered eligible and used for the bibliometric analysis. In the
   systematic review, the study aimed for specific community adaptation
   strategies from the 292 papers, and 118 papers were eligible following
   developed criteria. Results indicate that countries are committed to
   helping their coastal communities to adapt to sea level rise impacts and
   the USA has been significant in that regard. Coastal communities adapt
   to sea level rise impacts by increasing their structural/physical or
   social options; however, policy/institutional assistance to intensify
   these options is limited. Also, specific community adaptation strategies
   to sea level rise impacts have been more of the engineered and built
   environment (67\%) strategies and few on ecosystem-based strategies
   (7\%). More ecosystem-based strategies are, thus, needed considering
   their socio-ecological benefits. Further research and increased
   communities-policymakers engagement for enhanced adaptive capacity is
   required.},

Title = {Sun exposure, nest temperature and loggerhead turtle hatchlings:
   Implications for beach shading management strategies at sea turtle
   rookeries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {451},
Pages = {105-114},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sea turtle incubation biology is tightly linked to nest thermal
   conditions due to the effect temperature has on hatching success, sex
   determination, morphology and locomotion performance. Because of this
   relationship between nest temperature and hatchling outcomes, global
   warming presents an immediate threat to many sea turtle nesting beaches
   throughout the world. Even small rises in nest temperatures may skew sex
   ratios and, raise egg mortality and influence hatchling phenotypes
   adversely, impacting on hatchling recruitment and ultimately species
   survival at some rookeries. The development of adaptive management
   practices capable of minimizing the effects of increasing global
   temperature on nest temperatures is thus a priority for animals
   exhibiting temperature-dependent sex-determination, such as sea turtles.
   Here, the relationship between solar radiation exposure and nest
   temperatures at the Mon Repos turtle rookery, south east Queensland,
   Australia was explored and the relationship between nest temperature and
   hatchling attributes examined. Shading decreased nest temperature, and
   higher nest temperatures were associated with smaller sized hatchlings
   that had decreased locomotion performance. The use of shading to
   minimize nest temperature is a management strategy that may be used to
   mitigate detrimental effects of increased global temperatures at some
   rookeries. Here, we explored the viability of natural shading options,
   such as the planting of trees behind nesting beaches, for combating the
   adverse effect of increased nest temperature caused by increased air
   temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The states of Perlis, Kedah, Penang and Perak in the north-west of
   Peninsular Malaysia have a total coastline of 550 km of which almost
   40\% are adjacent to agricultural lands. Parts of these lands were once
   intertidal and following their conversion into agricultural land, have
   been protected from the sea by coastal embankments since the 1950s.
   Extreme tides and wave erosion used to be the known hazards to these
   coastal lands, but over the past two decades sea level rise and the
   tsunami of 2004 have emerged as additional threats. A predicted sea
   level rise of 0.52m by 2100 and a tsunami inundation distance exceeding
   1000m inshore have raised concerns as to the sustainability of existing
   coastal defences, hinterland communities and economic activities. The
   combined impacts of both sea level rise and tsunami have made the
   north-west coastline the most vulnerable to coastal erosion and
   flooding. This paper compiles the findings of two key studies that
   assessed these coastal threats and determined the scientific basis for
   adaptive measures. The findings of the studies indicate that the
   north-west coast is the most vulnerable coast in Peninsular Malaysia.
   The paper also presents the physical impacts of these threats and the
   proposed adaptive strategies to mitigate them. Copyright (C) 2018 John

Abstract = {Many salt marshes throughout southern New England are exhibiting a trend
   toward submergence, as reported in this volume and other published
   literature. This paper provides a brief perspective on sea-level rise
   and the many other interacting factors that contribute to marsh
   submergence in this and other regions. Curtailing nutrient loading and
   removing or altering barriers (e.g., dams, dikes) to the delivery of
   suspended sediment to marshes are discussed as management or restoration
   techniques to consider for increasing long-term sustainability of
   marshes. Adaptation measures are many (e.g., thin-layer sediment
   application to marsh surface, facilitation of landward marsh migration,
   shoreline stabilization), but all require study to evaluate their
   potential for enhancing resilience. Research, monitoring, and dynamic
   modeling, coupled with appropriate management and adaptation approaches
   implemented at local and regional scales, will contribute to the
   challenge of sustaining salt marshes in an uncertain future of sea-level
   rise, other climate factors, and stressors associated with a developing
   coastal zone.},

Abstract = {The efforts made to reduce the causes and mitigate the effects of global
   climate change continue to be critical in coastal areas. Many adaptation
   strategies implemented in coastal areas remain inadequate or
   ineffective. Using primarily events and interventions carried out along
   the Portuguese Atlantic coast, this work aims to show the paradigm shift
   that has occurred in Portugal since the last century (the 1990s) within
   the scope of the National Coastal Zone Management Strategy, taking into
   account the new guidelines for the implementation of coastal defence
   works. In this context, this paper also aims to assist coastal
   communities in carrying out operational coastal management by presenting
   and discussing management tools and primary options that should be
   considered in any adaptation programme that is to be implemented. Both
   nonstructural and structural measures are considered. Action plans,
   warning systems, emergency plans, and evacuation plans belong to the
   first category. Education and training are also considered, because they
   play a key role in the sustainability of coastal areas, especially in
   the coming generations. Structural measures are adaptation options that
   are designed to increase the safety of people and reduce risks. They are
   discussed and grouped into categories that include accommodation,
   protection, and retreat. Recent cases of successful accommodation and
   protection measures implemented along the Portuguese coast are also
   presented and discussed.},

Title = {The Morphology, Dynamics and Potential Hotspots of Land Surface
   Temperature at a Local Scale in Urban Areas},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Current characterization of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) remains
   insufficient to support the effective mitigation and adaptation of
   increasing temperatures in urban areas. Planning and design strategies
   are restricted to the investigation of temperature anomalies at a city
   scale. By focusing on Land Surface Temperature of Wuhan, China, this
   research examines the temperature variations locally where mitigation
   and adaptation would be more feasible. It shows how local temperature
   anomalies can be identified morphologically. Technically, the
   MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite image products
   are used. They are first considered as noisy observations of the latent
   temperature patterns. The continuous latent patterns of the temperature
   are then recovered from these discrete observations by using the
   non-parametric Multi-Task Gaussian Process Modeling. The Multi-Scale
   Shape Index is then applied in the area of focus to extract the local
   morphological features. A triplet of shape, curvedness and temperature
   is formed as the criteria to extract local heat islands. The behavior of
   the local heat islands can thus be quantified morphologically. The
   places with critical deformations are identified as hotpots. The
   hotspots with certain yearly behavior are further associated with land
   surface composition to determine effective mitigation and adaptation
   strategies. This research can assist in the temperature and planning
   field on two levels: (1) the local land surface temperature patterns are
   characterized by decomposing the variations into fundamental deformation
   modes to allow a process-based understanding of the dynamics; and (2)
   the characterization at local scale conforms to planning and design
   conventions where mitigation and adaptation strategies are supposed to
   be more practical. The weaknesses and limitations of the study are
   addressed in the closing section.},

Abstract = {Extreme temperature is a major threat to urban populations; thus, it is
   crucial to understand future changes to plan adaptation and mitigation
   strategies. We assess historical and CMIP6 projected trends of minimum
   and maximum temperatures for the 18 most populated Canadian cities.
   Temperatures increase (on average 0.3 degrees C/decade) in all cities
   during the historical period (1979-2014), with Prairie cities exhibiting
   lower rates (0.06 degrees C/decade). Toronto (0.5 degrees C/decade) and
   Montreal (0.7 degrees C/decade) show high increasing trends in the
   observation period. Higher-elevation cities, among those with the same
   population, show slower increasing temperature rates compared to the
   coastal ones. Projections for cities in the Prairies show 12\% more
   summer days compared to the other regions. The number of heat waves
   (HWs) increases for all cities, in both the historical and future
   periods; yet alarming increases are projected for Vancouver, Vic-toria,
   and Halifax from no HWs in the historical period to approximately 4
   HWs/year on average, towards the end of 2100 for the SSP5-8.5. The cold
   waves reduce considerably for all cities in the historical period at a
   rate of 2 CWs/decade on average and are projected to further reduce by
   50\% compared to the observed period.},

Title = {Microalgae as embedded environmental monitors},
Journal = {ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {954},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In marine ecosystems, microalgae are an important component as they
   transform large quantities of inorganic compounds into biomass and
   thereby impact environmental chemistry. Of particular relevance is
   phytoplankton's sequestration of atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas, and
   nitrate, one cause of harmful algae blooms. On the other hand,
   microalgae sensitively respond to changes in their chemical environment,
   which initiates an adaptation of their chemical composition. Analytical
   methodologies were developed in this study that utilize microalgae's
   adaptation as a novel approach for in-situ environmental monitoring.
   Longterm applications of these novel methods are investigations of
   environmental impacts on phytoplankton's sequestration performance and
   their nutritional value to higher organisms feeding on them.
   In order to analyze the chemical composition of live microalgae cells
   (Nannochloropsis oculata), FTIR-ATR spectroscopy has been employed. From
   time series of IR spectra, the formation of bio-sediment can be
   monitored and it has been shown that the nutrient availability has a
   small but observable impact. Since this bio-sediment formation is
   governed by several biological parameters of the cells such as growth
   rate, size, buoyancy, number of cells, etc., this enables studies of
   chemical environment's impact on biomass formation and the cells'
   physical parameters.
   Moreover, the spectroscopic signature of these microalgae has been
   determined from cultures grown under 25 different CO2 and NO3- mixtures
   (200 ppm-600 ppm CO2, 0.35 mM-0.75 mM NO3-). A novel, nonlinear modeling
   methodology coined `Predictor Surfaces' is being presented by means of
   which the nonlinear responses of the cells to their chemical environment
   could reliably be described. This approach has been utilized to measure
   the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over the phytoplankton culture
   as well as the nitrate concentration dissolved in their growing
   environment. The achieved precision of concentration predictions were a
   few percent of the measurement range. Moreover, the Predictor Surface
   itself allows for a chemical interpretation of the cells' response to a
   shift in their chemical environment. This will open new approaches to
   study the link between concentration levels in an ecosystem and the
   biological consequences for this ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The need for adaptive strategies to respond to uncertain long term
   processes of change in flooding systems is now well recognized. In the
   face of uncertainty, it is desirable to keep options open and enhance
   resilience. However, adaptive options are seldom achievable at zero
   cost-in other words genuine `win-win' solutions are rare. Therefore,
   appraisal frameworks are required that can evaluate the risks and costs
   of adaptive strategies over extended timescales in the context of a wide
   range of alternative futures. In principle this may appear to be a
   relatively straightforward task. However, in practice, appraising flood
   risk management options, whose nature and cost will vary depending on
   which of many uncertain futures actually materializes, can be a
   computationally burdensome and conceptually taxing task. This paper
   describes a formal approach for specifying risk-based decision appraisal
   in the context of future uncertainties and long term processes of
   change. At the core of the analysis is a deterministic flooding model
   for estimating the severity and consequence of flooding, and cost model
   for computing the cost of flood risk management options. Around this
   kernel are layered risk calculations, simulations of long term change,
   comprehensive sensitivity analysis, decision analysis and analysis of
   the robustness of risk-based decisions to the ambient uncertainties. In
   the example presented here, processes of long term change include
   increasing relative mean sea level and increasing damage potential
   resulting from economic growth. In both cases the rates of increase are
   uncertain, as are the costs of implementing the interventions from which
   options are constructed. These various uncertainties are expressed as
   Probability Density Functions (PDFs) over the variables in question.
   They are propagated through to option performance by means of a Monte
   Carlo experiment, allowing a PDF on performance to be constructed for
   each option.},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation planning has rapidly expanded to assist with
   reducing vulnerability to current and projected impacts of climate
   change. In Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS), planned
   adaptation is viewed as essential to address their high vulnerability to
   climate change, and planning has begun in earnest across the region.
   However, there has been limited analysis of adaptation planning
   documents in the region to assess their quality and content. This study
   assesses adaptation planning documents from Caribbean SIDS, focusing on
   inclusion of key stages of adaptation planning that were identified from
   international and regionally specific adaptation guidance instruments.
   Eighty-nine Caribbean adaptation planning documents-including policies,
   strategies, programs, and projects-were assessed, revealing that they
   differ considerably from guidance instruments. Key areas for improvement
   include the need for (i) more direct linkages between identification of
   adaptation options and assessments of climate hazards, impacts,
   vulnerability, and risk; (ii) identification and appraisal of a range of
   adaptation options; and (iii) increased inclusion and usage of
   quantitative information about hazards and impacts. Addressing these
   deficiencies may help to improve the status of adaptation planning in
   the region and ultimately aid in reducing the high vulnerability of
   these island nations to the impacts of climate change.},

Title = {Evaluation of Small-Scale Fishers' Perceptions on Climate Change and
   Their Coping Strategies: Insights from Lake Malawi},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The effects of climate change have negatively affected Malawi's
   agricultural production. In this context, fisheries have been providing
   alternative livelihoods. However, there is a knowledge gap around the
   responses of small-scale fishers to climate-related changes. Therefore,
   a study was conducted on the Western shores of Lake Malawi between
   August 2015 and April 2016. The study evaluated the perceived effects of
   climate change on small-scale fishers and their coping strategies by
   employing a wide range of methods for data collection and analysis. The
   study used explorative surveys, household surveys, focus group
   discussions and key informant interviews to collect data. The study
   randomly sampled 112 household heads who owned either fishing gear or a
   fishing vessel or both. Content analysis for themes was used to analyse
   the qualitative data. The Mann-Kendal Test was used to analyse trends in
   meteorological data, and binary logistic regression was used to
   determine factors that influence coping with low fish catches. Despite
   the respondents noticing an increased incidence of extreme weather
   events and low fish catches, their perceptions could not be validated
   using time series meteorological data. However, such perceptions were
   influenced by experience from long-time exposure to extreme weather
   events and to low fish catches. The majority of the fishers had adjusted
   to these changes by increasing their fishing time, using highly
   efficient illegal fishing nets, expanding farming land, operating small
   businesses and undertaking casual labour in agriculture and fishing
   activities. The fishers' propensity to adjust to these changes increased
   due to the presence of the following factors: older age of household
   head, higher education level, being married and having an annual income.
   In contrast, being a member of fish conservation club decreased the
   probability of adjusting. This study emphasizes the need to be cautious
   when defining and framing perceptions of local communities on extreme
   weather events as data obtained could be misleading. Furthermore, a
   multi-sectoral approach to balance sustainable livelihoods and
   management of fisheries is needed. These findings provide theoretical
   and practical lessons that can inform design, planning and
   implementation of policies that enhance adaptive capacity in fisheries
   and promote sustainable livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {One area where climate adaptation policies are proving difficult to
   design and implement is at the coast. On one hand, some of the most
   severe impacts of climate change are being recorded at the coast -

   This paper analyses the coherency of policies along Ireland's coast from
   a climate adaptation perspective. Results suggest that many policies are
   developed in an ad-hoc fashion around the needs of single sectors.
   Improved policy coherence at all levels of governance is required to

Abstract = {There is a clear need to apply better and more affective management
   schemes to coastal ecosystem restoration projects. It is very common for
   aquatic ecosystem restoration projects not to meet their goals. Poor
   performance has led to a high degree of uncertainty about the potential
   success of any restoration effort. Under adaptive management, the
   knowledge gained through monitoring of the project and social policies
   is translated into restoration policy and program redesign. Planners and
   managers can utilize the information from the monitoring programs in an
   effective way to assure that project goals are met or that informed and
   objective decisions are made to address both ecological and societal
   needs. The three main ingredients of an effective adaptive management
   plan in a restoration project are: 1. a clear goal statement; 2. a
   conceptual model; and 3. a decision framework. The goal `drives' the
   design of the project and helps guide the development of performance
   criteria. The goal statement and performance criteria provide the means
   by which the system can be judged. With the conceptual model, the
   knowledge base from the field of ecological science plays an active and
   critical role in designing the project to meet the goal. A
   system-development matrix provides a simple decision framework to view
   the alternative states for the system during development, incorporate
   knowledge gained through the monitoring program, and formulate a
   decision on actions to take if the system is not meeting its goal. (C)

Abstract = {Global warming is one of the most serious challenges facing us today. It
   may be linked to the increase in atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse
   gases (GHGs), leading to a rise in sea level, notable shifts in
   ecosystems, and in the frequency and intensity of wild fires. There is a
   strong interest in stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and
   other GHGs by decreasing carbon emission and/or increasing carbon
   sequestration. Biotic sequestration is an important and effective
   strategy to mitigate the effects of rising atmospheric CO2
   concentrations by increasing carbon sequestration and storage capacity
   of ecosystems using plant photosynthesis and by decreasing carbon
   emission using biofuel rather than fossil fuel. Improvement of
   photosynthetic carbon assimilation, using transgenic engineering,
   potentially provides a set of available and effective tools for
   enhancing plant carbon sequestration. In this review, firstly different
   biological methods of CO2 assimilation in C-3, C-4 and CAM plants are
   introduced and three types of C-4 pathways which have high
   photosynthetic performance and have evolved as CO2 pumps are briefly
   summarized. Then (i) the improvement of photosynthetic carbon
   assimilation of C-3 plants by transgenic engineering using non-C-4
   genes, and (ii) the overexpression of individual or multiple C-4 cycle
   photosynthetic genes (PEPC, PPDK, PCK, NADP-ME and NADP-MDH) in
   transgenic C-3 plants (e. g. tobacco, potato, rice and Arabidopsis) are
   highlighted. Some transgenic C-3 plants (e. g. tobacco, rice and
   Arabidopsis) overexpressing the FBP/SBPase, ictB and cytochrome C-6
   genes showed positive effects on photosynthetic efficiency and growth
   characteristics. However, over the last 28 years, efforts to overexpress
   individual, double or multiple C-4 enzymes in C-3 plants like tobacco,
   potato, rice, and Arabidopsis have produced mixed results that do not
   confirm or eliminate the possibility of improving photosynthesis of C-3
   plants by this approach. Finally, a prospect is provided on the
   challenges of enhancing carbon assimilation of C-3 plants using
   transgenic engineering in the face of global warming, and the trends of
   the most promising approaches to improving the photosynthetic
   performance of C-3 plants.},

Abstract = {As part of an interdisciplinary research programme on coastal risks, a

   representations of coastal erosion and sea flooding among inhabitants of

   or more specifically sense of place, will initially be examined,
   followed by individuals' preferred risk adaptation strategies.
   Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 894 inhabitants from five
   coastal municipalities in Brittany. Results show that coastal risks are
   not a top priority for respondents. Paying particular attention to
   respondents who spontaneously cited coastal rather than other risks or
   no risk, we show that their relationship to place differs from the other
   respondents, as do their preferred adaptation strategies. These results
   lead to a better understanding of attitudes towards coastal risks among
   inhabitants of at-risk areas and provide more in-depth knowledge on
   coastal zone vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Climate change is having and will continue to have a range of negative
   impacts on social-environmental systems. Many ports, with their coastal
   locations and essential roles in regional and national economies, face
   particular exposure to storm impacts that may worsen with climate
   change. Currently in the United States port resilience planning falls
   primarily on port operators. Engaging a wider range of stakeholders in
   long-term seaport functioning may reduce risks from disruptive and
   potentially irreversible impacts of climate change. This study uses
   empirical data gathered through two case studies of highly exposed U.S.
   ports, Gulfport (MS) and Providence (RI), to identify strategies that
   port planners and external stakeholders consider feasible for enhancing
   their port's resilience. This article categorizes these resilience
   strategies and suggests the potential role that different stakeholders
   could play in facilitation and implementation.},

Title = {Sustainability challenges of adaptation interventions: do the challenges
   vary with implementing organizations?},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is a necessary response to reduce risk and
   vulnerability and to realize opportunities. However, not all adaptation
   measures bring about positive changes. In some cases, local-level
   adaptations may shift risks to other vulnerable places and communities.
   Both maladaptation, generally recognized to be undesirable at least in
   terms of the results it generates, and sustainable adaptation has been
   studied in diverse settings and for a range of climate-related risks.
   Sustainable adaptation aims at reducing poverty and enhancing social
   equity and environmental integrity in concert with risk reduction.
   However, there is limited research on how interventions by state and
   non-state implementing entities differ in addressing issues related to
   sustainable adaptation and the threat of maladaptation. In this paper,
   we use case study analysis to focus on three specific adaptation
   interventions-homestead plinth level raise, pond sand filter for safe
   drinking water, and surface and groundwater irrigation-in Bangladesh.
   Drawing on in-depth interviews with stakeholders facing recurring
   drought and coastal hazards, we emphasis on the implemented
   interventions and the roles played by a local NGO and central
   government. The first two interventions were implemented by a local NGO
   and the irrigation system by the government. Although the selected
   interventions led to many benefits, including reduced community
   vulnerability, enhanced resilience, and adaptive capacity, the
   stakeholders also identified sustainability challenges. NGO-implemented
   interventions, for example, suffer from beneficiary selection bias,
   while state-implemented intervention does not conform, at least partly,
   to environmental integrity. To limit maladaptation, it is necessarily
   better to understand beneficiary attitude(s) towards an intervention.
   Findings can help inform future interventions by raising awareness of
   agencies' roles and responsibilities in implementation and recognizing
   the stakeholders' adaptation needs and priorities.},

Title = {Willingness of homeowners to mitigate climate risk through insurance},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {68},
Number = {8-9},
Pages = {2265-2277},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is projected to increase flood risks in certain regions
   due to an increase in both precipitation and sea level rise. In
   addition, socio-economic scenarios project an increase in urbanization
   in flood prone areas, which results in a higher damage potential. The
   combined effect of climate and land use change on flood risks requires
   innovative adaptation policies to cope with rising risks. Increasingly,
   attention is paid to the role insurance can play in mitigating damage by
   providing incentives to policyholders to undertake damage reducing
   measures. The willingness of homeowners in the Netherlands to undertake
   measures that mitigate flood damage in exchange for benefits on
   hypothetical flood insurance policies is examined using surveys. The
   results indicate that many homeowners are willing to make investments in
   mitigation. In particular, approximately two-thirds are willing to
   invest in water barriers in exchange for a premium reduction and about a
   fifth are willing to replace floor types that are vulnerable to flooding
   with water resistant floor types. Furthermore, about a quarter are
   willing to move central heating installations to floors safe against
   flooding in favor of a reduction in the insurance premium. Estimates of
   the effectiveness of these mitigation measures to limit potential flood
   damage in the river delta indicate that prevented damage could be
   substantial, namely in the order of I billion euro or larger. Reductions
   in (absolute) flood risk due to mitigation are especially large under
   climate change. A probit model indicates that existing arrangements for
   compensating flood damage, risk awareness and perceptions, and
   geographical characteristics are important determinants in the decision
   to undertake mitigation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Adapting coffee production to climate change is a significant challenge
   requiring a detailed understanding of local climatic change patterns and
   the consequences, both real and perceived, for coffee production. To
   this end, we examined changes in precipitation at Mt. Kilimanjaro over
   the last two decades and conducted twelve focus group discussions to
   obtain farmers' perceptions on climate change, the impact of extreme
   weather events on coffee production and the potential of shade trees as
   an adaptation strategy. Despite an increase in total annual
   precipitation, farmers are still confronted with droughts due to a shift
   in seasons. We found a delayed onset of the main rainy season and showed
   that a positive Indian Ocean Dipole contributes to the increase in
   precipitation during the short rainy season. Farmers clearly described
   the impacts of drought or excess rainfall on coffee production during
   flowering, maturation, and harvest. Thus, adaptation strategies need to
   be tailored such that specific coffee development stages are buffered
   against the effects of droughts, shorter wet seasons, and less frequent
   but heavier rainfall events. To develop the potential of shade trees as
   an effective adaptation strategy, optimum shade density, specific tree
   species, and management practices need to be identified.},

Abstract = {The expanding human global footprint and growing demand for freshwater
   have placed tremendous stress on inland aquatic ecosystems. Aichi Target
   10 of the Convention on Biological Diversity aims to minimize
   anthropogenic pressures affecting vulnerable ecosystems, and pressure
   interactions are increasingly being incorporated into environmental
   management and climate change adaptation strategies. In this study, we
   explore how climate change, overfishing, forest disturbance, and
   invasive species pressures interact to affect inland lake walleye
   (Sander vitreus) populations. Walleye support subsistence, recreational,
   and commercial fisheries and are one of most sought-after freshwater
   fish species in North America. Using data from 444 lakes situated across
   an area of 475 000 km(2) in Ontario, Canada, we apply a novel
   statistical tool, R-INLA, to determine how walleye biomass deficit
   (carrying capacity-observed biomass) is impacted by multiple pressures.
   Individually, angling activity and the presence of invasive zebra
   mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were positively related to biomass
   deficits. In combination, zebra mussel presence interacted negatively
   and antagonistically with angling activity and percentage decrease in
   watershed mature forest cover. Velocity of climate change in growing
   degree days above 5 degrees C and decrease in mature forest cover
   interacted to negatively affect walleye populations. Our study
   demonstrates how multiple pressure evaluations can be conducted for
   hundreds of populations to identify influential pressures and vulnerable
   ecosystems. Understanding pressure interactions is necessary to guide
   management and climate change adaptation strategies, and achieve global
   biodiversity targets.},

Title = {Positive Social-Ecological Feedbacks in Community-Based Conservation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Marine area-based conservation measures including no-take zones (areas
   with no fishing allowed) are often designed through lengthy processes
   that aim to optimize for ecological and social objectives. Their (semi)
   permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In
   this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of
   short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive
   co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the
   fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5
   years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and
   trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We
   use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of
   such fisheries closures ({''}fishing refugia{''}) in northwest Mexico to
   hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological
   outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based
   management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing
   as long as initial designs are ecologically ``good enough{''} and
   supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive
   management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other
   social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the
   dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor
   design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool's
   capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological
   benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor
   ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social

Title = {Regional variation in the effectiveness of methane-based and land-based
   climate mitigation options},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {513-544},

Abstract = {Scenarios avoiding global warming greater than 1.5 or 2 degrees C, as
   stipulated in the Paris Agreement, may require the combined mitigation
   of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions alongside enhancing negative
   emissions through approaches such as afforestation-reforestation (AR)
   and biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). We use the
   JULES land surface model coupled to an inverted form of the IMOGEN
   climate emulator to investigate mitigation scenarios that achieve the
   1.5 or 2 degrees C warming targets of the Paris Agreement. Specifically,
   within this IMOGEN-JULES framework, we focus on and characterise the
   global and regional effectiveness of land-based (BECCS and/or AR) and
   anthropogenic methane (CH4) emission mitigation, separately and in
   combination, on the anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emission budgets (AFFEBs) to 2100. We use consistent data and
   socio-economic assumptions from the IMAGE integrated assessment model
   for the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2). The analysis
   includes the effects of the methane and carbon-climate feedbacks from
   wetlands and permafrost thaw, which we have shown previously to be
   significant constraints on the AFFEBs.
   Globally, mitigation of anthropogenic CH4 emissions has large impacts on
   the anthropogenic fossil fuel emission budgets, potentially offsetting
   (i.e. allowing extra) carbon dioxide emissions of 188-212 Gt C. This is
   because of (a) the reduction in the direct and indirect radiative
   forcing of methane in response to the lower emissions and hence
   atmospheric concentration of methane and (b) carbon-cycle changes
   leading to increased uptake by the land and ocean by CO2-based
   fertilisation. Methane mitigation is beneficial everywhere, particularly
   for the major CH4-emitting regions of India, the USA, and China.
   Land-based mitigation has the potential to offset 51100 Gt C globally,
   the large range reflecting assumptions and uncertainties associated with
   BECCS. The ranges for CH4 reduction and BECCS implementation are valid
   for both the 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming targets. That is the mitigation
   potential of the CH4 and of the land-based scenarios is similar for
   regardless of which of the final stabilised warming levels society aims
   for. Further, both the effectiveness and the preferred land management
   strategy (i.e. AR or BECCS) have strong regional dependencies.
   Additional analysis shows extensive BECCS could adversely affect water
   security for several regions. Although the primary requirement remains
   mitigation of fossil fuel emissions, our results highlight the potential
   for the mitigation of CH4 emissions to make the Paris climate targets
   more achievable.},

Abstract = {Mediterranean high-mountain endemic species are particularly vulnerable
   to climatic changes in temperature, precipitation and snow-cover
   dynamics. Sierra Nevada (Spain) is a biodiversity hotspot in the western
   Mediterranean, with an enormous plant species richness and endemicity.
   Moehringia fontqueri is a threatened endemic plant restricted to
   north-facing siliceous rocks along a few ridges of the eastern Sierra
   Nevada. To guide conservation actions against climate change effects,
   here we propose the simultaneous assessment of the current reproductive
   success and the possible species' range changes between current and
   future climatic conditions, assessing separately different
   subpopulations by altitude. Reproductive success was tested through the
   seed-set data analysis. The species' current habitat suitability was
   modeled in Maxent using species occurrences, topographic, satellite and
   climatic variables. Future habitat suitability was carried out for two
   climatic scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). The results showed the lowest
   reproductive success at the lowest altitudes, and vice versa at the
   highest altitudes. Habitat suitability decreased by 80\% from current
   conditions to the worst-case scenario (RCP 8.5). The lowest
   subpopulations were identified as the most vulnerable to climate change
   effects while the highest ones were the nearest to future suitable
   habitats. Our simultaneous assessment of reproductive success and
   habitat suitability aims to serve as a model to guide conservation,
   management and climate change mitigation strategies through adaptive
   management to safeguard the persistence of the maximum genetic pool of
   Mediterranean high-mountain plants threatened by climate change.},

Abstract = {The City of San Fernando in La Union is one of the coastal
   municipalities in the Philippines that are threatened by coastal
   erosion. This study estimated the economic vulnerability of the City on
   coastal erosion until 2100. Adaptation options were identified and
   evaluated by its economic, social, administrative and political
   feasibility. About 300 structures, 283,085 ne of land and 123,033 m(2)
   of beach along San Fernando Bay will be lost to coastal
   erosion/shoreline retreat by the year 2100. The adaptation options
   identified were: ``business as usual{''}, planned protection and planned
   retreat/relocation. Among the adoption strategies, planned protection
   turned out to be the best option. Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), which
   served as the basis for the economic feasibility of the options, showed
   that planned protection consistently yielded the highest estimate with a
   net present value (NPV) of about PhP 148.63 M under the assumption that
   beaches were not resilient (Scenario A), and about PhP 126.78 M under
   the assumption that beaches were resilient (Scenario B), at a discount
   rate of 6\%. This option also fared fairly in terms of social
   feasibility with 65\% of the survey respondents agreeing to it and also
   deemed legally/politically feasible with 82\% of the local government
   respondents agreed to support the proposed intervention.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {147-169},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to their vulnerability and their special role as being a center of
   economic activities cities are particularly important in the context of
   adaptation to adverse events derogating land quality, e.g. resulting
   from long-term climate change. This paper analyzes economic efficiency
   of public investments in adaptation within a spatial general equilibrium
   framework that focuses on the level of cities. We provide a theoretical
   analysis that highlights the fundamental forces determining efficient
   public investment in urban adaptation. We further extend the approach to
   a spatial computable general equilibrium model thereby identifying
   optimal urban adaptation investment strategies. Our analyses suggest
   that full adaptation can be an inefficient strategy even in urban areas
   due to a wide range of direct and indirect spatial general equilibrium
   effects. Setting investments optimally only reduces a small fraction of
   the welfare loss of non -adaptation. The findings are robust with
   respect to assumptions on the marginal returns of adaptation, the degree
   of possible relocation as a response to an adverse event (intra-urban
   relocation and inter -urban migration), and the funding scheme applied
   to finance adaptation (land tax vs. labor tax). Interestingly, adverse
   urban effects of adaptation could make non -adaptation more efficient
   than full adaptation. However, if adaptation measures like building
   dikes or even relocating cities are available and sufficiently
   productive, full adaptation could become an efficient policy option
   being able to offset a large fraction of the potential welfare loss of
   extreme events. Distributional effects of urban adaptation investment
   (absentee landowners vs. urban renters) as well as a misleading
   orientation of policymakers to maximize urban GDP rather than social
   welfare can result in overinvestment in urban adaptation.},

Title = {The impact on food security and future adaptation under climate
   variation: a case study of Taiwan's agriculture and fisheries},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {311-347},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {According to Food and Agriculture Organization and Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change reports, climate change will lead to a severe
   food-supply problem. In the future, food production will continually
   decrease because of aggravated effects of climate change, causing food
   production to continually decrease. Food production will be unable to
   satisfy the demand of the global population, leading to a food-security
   crisis. As the world population continues to increase, the shortage of
   food will become increasingly severe, particularly for those located in
   ``climate impact hotspots{''} of tropical, subtropical, small-island
   countries, and countries that are dependent on imports to meet domestic
   demand such as Taiwan. Numerous Taiwanese studies have suggested that
   agricultural and fishery productivity has declined because of climate
   variation, which may cause changes and instability in food quantity and
   quality, and increase deficiency and uncertainty in the food supply.
   Therefore, to discuss the risks posed by climate change to the stability
   of food supply and demand, this paper, taking Taiwan as a case, explored
   the impact of climate variation on food security and future adaptation
   strategies. TaiCCAT's supportive system for decision-making (TSSDA) was
   adopted here to assess and analyze the current situations of
   agricultural and fisheries production and supply, as well as future food
   supply risks, in addition to evaluating the deficiencies in the existing
   climate adaptation strategies in order to plan and revise feasible
   future adaptation alternatives. Based on the rule of risk management,
   the adaptation strategies recommended in this study were differentiated
   into two categories: proactive adaptation and planned adaptation.
   Proactive adaptation is emphasized to counter the uncertainty of food
   production, which increases the difficulty of production and necessity
   to import food. Conversely, planned adaptation can be used to manage the
   uncertainty of food supply to implement adjustments in production and
   marketing, as well as to mitigate the impact of climate variation.},

Abstract = {Most deliberations on climate policy are based on a mitigation response
   that assumes a gradually increasing reduction over time. However,
   situations may occur where a more urgent response is needed. A key
   question for climate policy in general, but even more in the case a
   rapid response is needed, is: what are the characteristic response times
   of the response options, such as rapid mitigation or solar radiation
   management (SRM)? This paper explores this issue, which has not received
   a lot of attention yet, by looking into the role of both societal and
   physical response times. For mitigation, technological and economic
   inertia clearly limit reduction rates with considerable uncertainty
   corresponding to political inertia and societies' ability to organize
   rapid mitigation action at what costs. The paper looks into a rapid
   emission reductions of 4-6 \% annually. Reduction rates at the top end
   of this range (up to 6 \%) could effectively reduce climate change, but
   only with a noticeable delay. Temperatures could be above those in the
   year of policy introduction for more than 70 years, with unknown
   consequences of overshoot. A strategy based on SRM is shown to have much
   shorter response times (up to decades), but introduces an important
   element of risk, such as ocean acidification and the risk of extreme
   temperature shifts in case action is halted. Above all, the paper
   highlights the role of response times in designing effective policy
   strategies implying that a better understanding of these crucial factors
   is required.},

   The study makes a general review of the main meetings, agreements and
   international entities related to the global climate that have served as
   the basis for the XXI Conference of the Parties, from which emanated the
   ``Paris Agreement{''}. After analyzing some implications of the
   aforementioned agreement and presenting evidence of the current
   situation, the main legal and normative instruments of the national
   marine and coastal areas are reviewed; the main risks in these areas of
   the national territory associated with climate change are evaluated; the
   main existing adaptation measures are analyzed; and, the most important
   socioeconomic and political barriers that exist for their correct
   implementation are established. Finally, some lines of action are
   proposed to improve the current vulnerability of the coastal areas and
   increase their resilience.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and
   sea-level rise. These impacts will exacerbate the risks posed by the
   continuing environmental degradation confronting the coastal
   communities.
   Adopting a participatory research approach, the study examines the
   vulnerability of socioeconomic groups among the coastal population in
   Cavite City, Philippines, their current adaptation strategies and their
   adaptive capacity to cope with the impacts of climate variability and
   extremes and sea-level rise. Under a future scenario of a 1-m
   accelerated sea-level rise (ASLR), the study also looks into its
   potential effects on these urban coastal communities and ecosystems.
   In the context of poverty reduction and sustainable development, this
   study suggests a local framework for integrating adaptation strategies
   and actions into integrated coastal management (ICM) planning. It also
   recommends appropriate policy and institutional reform, capacity
   building and improved knowledge management towards increasing the
   resilience and adaptive capacity of these coastal communities to current
   and future climate risks. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The law should be a critical tool in promoting and directing climate
   change adaptation in the USA. This should be particularly true in the
   nation's extensive coastal zone, much of which is subject to increasing
   rates of sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing numbers of
   increasingly powerful storms, and saltwater intrusion. However,
   significant coastal infrastructure hampers many coastal adaptation
   strategies by making retreat both expensive and politically unpalatable.
   This article examines the specific role of insurance and other financing
   programs in coastal adaptation strategies. Insurance operates primarily
   to mitigate risk. The article focuses specifically on the National Flood
   Insurance Program (NFIP), which is now driven by coastal catastrophes
   and is close to bankruptcy; Florida's decision to provide state-financed
   insurance to coastal property owners in the wake of the 2004-2005
   hurricane season; and, conversely, the decisions of other states to use
   state and federal financing instead to facilitate coastal adaptation,
   including buyouts of transitioning coastal properties.},

Title = {Facing the wave of change: stakeholder perspectives on climate

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most important issues confronting the
   sustainable supply of seafood, with projections suggesting major effects
   on wild and farmed fisheries worldwide. While climate change has been a
   consideration for Australian fisheries and aquaculture management,
   emphasis in both research and adaptation effort has been at the
   production end of supply chains-impacts further along the chain have
   been overlooked to date. A holistic biophysical and socio-economic
   system view of seafood industries, as represented by end-to-end supply
   chains, may lead to an additional set of options in the face of climate
   change, thus maximizing opportunities for improved fishery
   profitability, while also reducing the potential for maladaptation. In
   this paper, we explore Australian seafood industry stakeholder
   perspectives on potential options for adaptation along seafood supply
   chains based on future potential scenarios. Stakeholders, representing
   wild capture and aquaculture industries, provided a range of actions
   targeting different stages of the supply chain. Overall, proposed
   strategies were predominantly related to the production end of the
   supply chain, suggesting that greater attention in developing adaptation
   options is needed at post-production stages. However, there are
   chain-wide adaptation strategies that can present win-win scenarios,
   where commercial objectives beyond adaptation can also be addressed
   alongside direct or indirect impacts of climate. Likewise, certain
   adaptation strategies in place at one stage of the chain may have
   varying implications on other stages of the chain. These findings
   represent an important step in understanding the role of supply chains
   in effective adaptation of fisheries and aquaculture industries to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Low-lying coastal cities are widely acknowledged as the most densely
   populated places of urban settlement; they are also more vulnerable to
   risks resulting from intensive land use and land cover change, human
   activities, global climate change, and the rising sea levels. This study
   aims to predict how urban growth is affected by sea level rise (SLR) in
   the Australian context. We develop an urban cellular automata model
   incorporating urban planning policies as potential drivers or
   constraints of urban growth under different SLR scenarios and adaption
   strategies. Drawing on data capturing the socioeconomic and
   environmental factors in South East Queensland, Australia, our model is
   positioned to address one core research question: how does SLR affect
   future urban growth and human resettlement? Results show that urban
   growth in coastal regions varies depending on the extent to which the
   sea level rises and is affected by a combination of factors relating to
   urban planning and human adaptation strategies. Our study demonstrates
   the complexity of urban growth in coastal regions and the nuanced
   outcomes under different adaptation strategies in the context of rising
   sea levels.},

Abstract = {With the rapid expansion of urbanization around the world, the urban
   heat island effect embraced an enormous negative impact on megacities,
   including energy, environment and health conditions. Unfortunately,
   constructive geometry and human activities of megacities severely
   intensified the urban heat island phenomenon. Giving the contributions
   of pavement on the deterioration of urban heat island in megacities,
   this literature review synthesized the state-of-the-art potential
   strategies of pavement cooling technologies and applications to mitigate
   the urban heat island effect. Firstly, the optical-thermal balance on
   surface and the interior thermal behavior of pavement were
   comprehensively analyzed. Afterwards, this paper redefined the cool
   pavement technologies as the passive mitigation strategies, involved the
   application of reflective pavement, evaporation pavement, heat induced
   pavement and phase change materials. Especially, urban canyon impact and
   urban design were emphasized, which tended to be neglected on the
   implementations of cool pavement. In addition, the solar collector
   technologies on the pavement were proposed to sustainably reuse solar
   energy, acting as active strategies and renewable sources. Typically,
   representatives of solar collectors, including heat collection and
   thermoelectric pavement, were described and investigated. Existing
   research results presented the promising potential of pavement cooling
   technologies to mitigate the urban heat island impact and renewable
   energy sustainability. Moreover, prospects were also summarized to show
   the opportunities and avenues for future study.},

Abstract = {A solution-adaptive algorithm is presented and tested for the shallow
   water equations. Specifically, we focus on the two-dimensional modelling
   of wind-induced hydrodynamics in shallow waters, characterised by a
   strong influence of variable bed topography and aquatic vegetation. The
   numerical solution is obtained using a Godunov-type finite-volume scheme
   on a hierarchical Cartesian mesh, with local time stepping. A simple,
   but robust algorithm based on the velocity gradient is proposed to
   control the dynamic mesh adaptation. Simulations on a representative
   steady-state and unsteady benchmark problem show that
   solution-adaptivity is successful in reallocating cells to where they
   improve global accuracy more efficiently. The algorithm is then applied
   to model the wind-driven circulations in Lake Neusiedl, proving the
   algorithm's robustness in resolving complex geometry and vegetation

   Urban climates will be faced with elevated temperatures and future
   climate conditions are expected to cause higher ozone concentrations,

   of the atmosphere and changes in deposition of particulate air
   pollution. This paper describes a conceptual outline of a

Title = {Diving Ecotourism as Climate Change Communicating Means: Greek Diving
   Instructors' Perceptions},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ROLE OF EDUCATION},
Series = {Climate Change Management},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {435-455},
Abstract = {Climate change and loss of biodiversity are some of the most significant
   challenges in coastal areas. It is therefore imperative to design
   effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to achieve ecological
   sustainability patterns. The Diving Community could become powerful
   change agents to tackle and mitigate climate change; and thus marine
   ecosystems' extinction. This research provides an extensive literature
   review to link the benefits of diving ecotourism. The issue as to
   whether diving tourism can be a tool to promote sustainability in
   coastal regions is also investigated. Based on face-to-face interviews
   with diving instructors who work in Greek Diving Centers, this survey
   also revealed their perceptions of diving tourism and climate change.
   The most important findings of the research revealed that Greek diving
   instructors appeared to have the perceptions that ``Diving tourism can
   be a means of promoting education and communication on climate
   change{''} (mean = 4.2),{''}Diving training promotes responsible
   environmental behavior{''} (mean = 4.02), ``Diving tourism promotes the
   conservation of ecosystems in the area{''} (mean = 4), ``Diving tourism
   promotes sustainability and can therefore promote campaigns to reduce
   the impact of climate change{''} (mean = 3.82), and ``Diving training
   can promote strategies to reduce the impact of climate change{''} (mean
   = 3.77). Through the findings of the survey it was concluded that diving
   ecotourism could play a vital role in promoting mitigation and
   adaptation strategies in coastal areas. Consequently, Greek diving
   instructors are key players in raising awareness of climate change in
   coastal areas.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change in small-scale fisheries: Insights from
   indigenous communities in the global north and south},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {160-170},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change is having a significant influence on global fish
   production as well as on small-scale fishers' livelihoods, nutrition,
   and food security. We compared two climate-sensitive small-scale
   fisheries (SSFs) - an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic and the
   Coastal-Vedda in Sri Lanka - to broaden our understanding of how
   fisheries-dependent Indigenous communities respond and adapt to climate
   change impacts. We used three steps to achieve this comparative study.
   To do this, we developed a resilience-based conceptual framework to
   empirically assess adaptations in two SSF communities, based on a
   literature review. Using the proposed framework and collecting
   qualitative field data over three years (2016-2019) to investigate how
   different remote SSFs experience and respond to climate change, we
   assessed Inuit and Coastal-Vedda case studies. The framework provided
   the structure for data analysis and conceptual guidance for two
   empirical assessments and the comparative analysis. Finally, we carried
   out the comparative analysis across the case studies using content
   analysis, identifying adaptive strategies, sources of resilience, and
   characteristics of successful adaptation. Additionally, we used
   discourse analysis to develop sources of resilience and characteristics
   of successful adaptation. Two key adaptive strategies emerged in common
   across the two communities - diversification and adaptive co-management.
   Eight sources of resilience that underpin adaptive capacity: i) use of
   diverse kinds of knowledge; ii) practice of different ways of learning;
   iii) use of community-based institutions; iv) efforts to improve human
   agency; v) unique worldviews; vi) specific cultural attributes that keep
   up with adaptation; vii) effective social networks; and viii) a high
   level of flexibility. Definitive characteristics that need to promote
   successful community adaptation: continuous learning through knowledge
   co-production; capacity-building to improve human agency; a
   place-specific nature (rootedness); collective action and partnerships
   through community-based institutions; and flexibility.},

   Both Climate Change and Adaptation Strategies: A US Pacific Northwest
   Alternative Coastal Futures Analysis},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal communities face heightened risk to coastal flooding and erosion
   hazards due to sea-level rise, changing storminess patterns, and
   evolving human development pressures. Incorporating uncertainty
   associated with both climate change and the range of possible adaptation
   measures is essential for projecting the evolving exposure to coastal
   flooding and erosion, as well as associated community vulnerability
   through time. A spatially explicit agent-based modeling platform, that
   provides a scenario-based framework for examining interactions between
   human and natural systems across a landscape, was used in Tillamook
   County, OR (USA) to explore strategies that may reduce exposure to
   coastal hazards within the context of climate change. Probabilistic
   simulations of extreme water levels were used to assess the impacts of
   variable projections of sea-level rise and storminess both as individual
   climate drivers and under a range of integrated climate change scenarios
   through the end of the century. Additionally, policy drivers, modeled
   both as individual management decisions and as policies integrated
   within adaptation scenarios, captured variability in possible human
   response to increased hazards risk. The relative contribution of
   variability and uncertainty from both climate change and policy
   decisions was quantified using three stakeholder relevant landscape
   performance metrics related to flooding, erosion, and recreational beach
   accessibility. In general, policy decisions introduced greater
   variability and uncertainty to the impacts of coastal hazards than
   climate change uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty across a suite of
   coproduced performance metrics can help determine the relative impact of
   management decisions on the adaptive capacity of communities under
   future climate scenarios.},

Title = {Evaluating technological resilience of small drinking water systems

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {With prevailing changes in climate and increasing population, small
   drinking water systems in the climate-vulnerable parts of the world have
   already exhibited and left traces of prominent unpredictability of water
   availability, in terms of both water quantity and water quality.
   Dimensions of climate change, such as large variability in precipitation
   pattern, rise in temperature and associated increase in evaporation
   rates, as well as their consequences, are surely going to affect the
   unsophisticated, small drinking water systems which are serving mass
   populations in South Asia and many other parts of the world. This
   research paper aims to analyze the possible extents of vulnerability of
   some selected small drinking water systems currently being operated in
   the coastal areas of Bangladesh as a result of the predicted changes in
   climatic parameters such as temperature, precipitation and evaporation
   along with sea level rise and extreme events such as cyclones. However,
   to examine possible future climate change scenarios, four Global Climate
   Models have been applied in developing projections of different climatic
   parameters for Bangladesh. Based on the projections of climate models
   and associated key vulnerabilities being assessed, this paper features
   the evaluation of potential technological resilience of specific small
   drinking water systems from the Bangladesh perspective.},

Abstract = {To meet the ambitious EC target of an 80\% reduction in greenhouse gas
   emissions by 2050, CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) needs to move rapidly
   towards full scale implementation with geological storage solutions both
   on and offshore. Onshore storage offers increased flexibility and
   reduced infrastructure and monitoring costs. Enabling onshore storage
   will support management of decarbonisation strategies at territory level
   while enhancing security of energy supply and local economic activities,
   and securing jobs across Europe. However, successful onshore storage
   also requires overcoming some unique technical and societal challenges.
   ENOS will provide crucial advances to help foster onshore CO2 storage
   across Europe through:
   1. Developing, testing and demonstrating in the field, under ``real-life
   conditions{''}, key technologies specifically adapted to onshore
   storage.
   2. Contributing to the creation of a favourable environment for onshore
   storage across Europe.
   The ENOS site portfolio will provide a great opportunity for
   demonstration of technologies for safe and environmentally sound storage
   at relevant scale. Best practices will be developed using experience
   gained from the field experiments with the participation of local
   stakeholders and the lay public. This will produce improved integrated
   research outcomes and increase stakeholder understanding and confidence
   in CO2 storage. In this improved framework, ENOS will catalyse new
   onshore pilot and demonstration projects in new locations and geological
   settings across Europe, taking into account the site-specific and local
   socio-economic context. By developing technologies from TRL4/5 to TRL6
   across the storage lifecycle, feeding the resultant knowledge and
   experience into training and education and cooperating at the
   pan-European and global level, ENOS will have a decisive impact on
   innovation and build the confidence needed for enabling onshore CO2
   storage in Europe.
   ENOS is initiating strong international collaboration between European
   researchers and their counterparts from the USA, Canada, South Korea,
   Australia and South Africa for sharing experience worldwide based on
   real-life onshore pilots and field experiments. Fostering
   experience-sharing and research alignment between existing sites is key
   to maximise the investment made at individual sites and to support the
   efficient large scale deployment of CCS. ENOS is striving to promote
   collaboration between sites in the world through a programme of site
   twinning, focus groups centered around operative issues and the creation
   of a leakage simulation alliance. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Balancing conflicting mitigation and adaptation behaviours of urban
   residents under climate change and the urban heat island effect},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Under a warming climate and urban heat island effects, cooling
   behaviours are increasingly important for city dwellers. Cooling
   actions, especially air conditioning, receive increasing scrutiny in
   social science, as does engagement and communication on behaviours
   spanning adaptation and mitigation. In response, this paper evaluates
   the relation between residents' adaptation and mitigation behaviours
   around cooling in Fukuoka, Japan, and draws lessons for communication on
   encouraging adaptation and mitigation actions. A survey distributed to
   residents in six areas of Fukuoka, Japan, assessed perceptions of global
   warming and urban heat island effects, frequency of mitigation and
   adaptation behaviours, use of air conditioning, electricity bills and
   evaluation of green spaces. We observe a difference between respondents
   using air conditioning with an energysaving (i.e. mitigation) focus,
   versus those using air conditioning with an adaptation (i.e. cooling)
   focus. We also note residents emphasising mitigation behaviours may use
   shade in parks or cooling centres as alternative cooling strategies, but
   that awareness of effective air conditioning use may be lacking. Our
   findings build on existing literature by reinforcing - in a subtropical
   context - the need to reconsider practices around air conditioner use;
   and illustrate the value of a breadth of messages to promote joint
   mitigation and adaptation actions.},

Abstract = {Florida, one of the world's most visited tourist destinations, holds one
   of the most vulnerable positions as a result of climate change. Through
   a quantitative survey, this study gathered the responses of 432 tourists
   who had previously visited Florida, with a hypothetical scenario of
   changed climatic conditions. The examination of the tourist perspective
   showed the presence of ample sunshine and factors related to beach
   comfort as the reasons for choosing the destination. In a scenario were
   beaches disappear and tropical diseases become more widespread, the
   majority of respondents stated they would choose a different
   destination. However, respondents would reconsider their intentions if
   adaptation measures such as reduced prices, coastal habitat conservation
   and measures to protect beaches from erosion and coastal areas from
   inundation were in place. The findings suggest that seasonal and
   geographic shifts in tourism demand could be mitigated by the
   implementation of adaptation measures at the destination level.},

Title = {Assessment of the Vulnerability of the Lucana Coastal Zones (South

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coasts are highly dynamic and geo-morphologically complex systems that
   are exposed to several factors such as waves, extreme meteorological
   events and climate change. It is also well-recognized that coastal
   zones, characterized by an increasing population growth, are vulnerable
   to climate change. In addition, coastal erosion, resulting from natural
   environment changes and human activities, acts worldwide. Consequently,
   it is necessary to quantify coastal hazards vulnerability and develop
   tools to monitor coastal risks and support making targeted climate
   adaptation policies. In this paper, a framework to estimate coastal
   vulnerability to flooding and erosion has been developed for the Ionian
   Basilicata coast. It is based on two methods: the integrated
   vulnerability index (flooding and erosion) and the CeD physical
   vulnerability index (multi-risk assessment). Our results are in
   agreement with the recent shoreline evolution: the integrated coastal
   risk of the Ionian Basilicata coast is generally medium to high, while
   the ``physical erosion vulnerability{''} is generally high to very high.
   In addition, the results highlight a spatial variability of the
   vulnerability, probably due to the morphology of the beach, which
   requires developing a strategic approach to coastal management and
   defining mitigation measures, considering relevant risk aspects as the
   vulnerability and exposure degree.},

Title = {Community perceptions of flood resilience as represented in cognitive
   maps},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Community perceptions of flood resilience hinge upon translation of
   impressions of events and built environment, which thereby influence a
   community's ability to resist, cope with and recover from adverse
   impacts of flooding. Particularly in developing countries, NGOs, often
   in collaboration with communities, design and fund non-traditional
   structural measures to enhance community resilience. This study examines
   community perceptions of flood resilience in the Haor region of
   Bangladesh, where communities live on constructed islands, reinforced by
   structural flood mitigation measures. Wave activity due to riverine
   flooding places communities at significant risk, especially as
   NGO-funded non-traditional structural measures intended to increase
   resilience may fail to do so. Small group meetings with community
   members were facilitated in graphically depicting and discussing areas
   of risk and relative safety during flood events. Maps constructed by
   community groups indicate that perceptions of community vulnerability
   are shared between generations, and that measures intended to enhance
   resilience may actually increase community perceptions of vulnerability,
   highlighting a need for a more nuanced understanding of community
   adaptation to ongoing risk. Findings identified the use of
   non-language-dependent tools such as cognitive mapping as quick and
   effective data collection mechanisms. Incorporating this local knowledge
   allows for more effective targeted measures, increasing community
   resilience and better informing NGO practices.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {229},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most significant environmental issues
   facing communities, while poor construction and absence of effective
   air-conditioning (AC) predominantly cause indoor overheating. Although
   AC may help meeting indoor comfort, it increases the vulnerability of
   low-income residents, triggers large energy consumption, and generates
   anthropogenic heat, which worsens heat stress out-door. The capacity of
   buildings to maintain comfortable thermal conditions without mechanical
   cooling is the key factor protecting occupants against the rising
   temperature. Residents of Darwin, Australia, will be largely affected by
   increasing temperature where the annual peak ambient temperature may
   increase by 7.4 degrees C in 2060, while the number of hours above 30
   degrees C will rise by 70\%. Based on regional climate modelling for the
   Australian area and using a building energy simulation platform, we
   computed that by 2060 the indoor air temperature in a typical
   residential building may exceed 30 degrees C for over 4000 h under
   free-floating condition, with a peak daytime and night-time temperatures
   of 39 degrees C and 36.5 degrees C, respectively. The sensible thermal
   energy need for cooling per unit area under thermostatically controlled
   condition will increase from the current level of 110.7 kWh/m 2 to 196.8
   kWh/m(2) in 2060. Different adaptation techniques when applied to the
   typical residential building yield to the peak indoor air temperature
   drop by 3.3-12 degrees C, and cooling energy needs reductions by
   23.5-195.3 kWh/m(2) (12-99.7\%) for low, medium, and high retrofit
   buildings compared to the typical residential building in 2060. Our
   study indicates that improved building quality is necessary to enhance
   survivability and energy efficiency in Darwin considering the role of
   building adaptation measures to counterbalance the impacts of global
   warming. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The South Saskatchewan River Basin is one of Canada's most threatened
   watersheds, with water supplies in most subbasins over-allocated. In
   2013, stakeholders representing irrigation districts, the environment,
   and municipalities collaborated with researchers and consultants to
   explore opportunities to improve the resiliency of the management of the
   Oldman and South Saskatchewan River subbasins. Streamflow scenarios for
   2025-2054 were constructed by the novel approach of regressing
   historical river flows against indices of large-scale ocean-atmosphere
   climate oscillations to derive statistical streamflow models, which were
   then run using projected climate indices from global climate models. The
   impacts of some of the most extreme scenarios were simulated using the
   hydrologic mass-balance model Operational Analysis and Simulation of
   Integrated Systems (OASIS). Based on stakeholder observations, the
   project participants proposed and evaluated potential risk management
   and adaption strategies, e.g., modifying existing infrastructure,
   building new infrastructure, changing operations to supplement
   environmental flows, reducing demand, and sharing supply. The OASIS
   model was applied interactively at live modeling sessions with
   stakeholders to explore practical adaptation strategies. Our results,
   which serve as recommendations for policy makers, showed that
   forecast-based rationing together with new expanded storage could
   dramatically reduce water shortages.},

Title = {Societal impacts and vulnerability to floods in Bangladesh and Nepal},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {36-42},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Bangladesh and Nepal lie between the Himalayas and low-lying coasts of
   the Bay of Bengal and are traversed by hundreds of rivers and
   tributaries. Historical data shows that, since 1970, the scale,
   intensity and duration of floods have increased in Bangladesh and Nepal,
   causing grave human suffering; disruptions in normal life and activity,
   damages of infrastructure, crops and agricultural land with severe
   impacts on the economy. Bangladesh is affected by torrential rain,
   glacier melt, upstream water flow and tidal surges. In 1988, Bangladesh
   experienced one of the most severe floods of the twentieth century which
   aroused significant concern internationally and triggered the Bangladesh
   Action Plan for Flood Control. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has so
   far constructed a number of Rood shelters and carried out 482 water and
   Rood control projects involving flood protection embankments, drainage
   channels, sluice gates and regulators on different rivers and canals.
   These also provided safety measures against inundation by tidal waves,
   storm-surges and flooding. The Terai region of Nepal is highly prone to
   hydrological risks including torrential rain, Roods, glaciers resulting
   in erosion and landslides. The Government of Nepal (GON) has implemented
   different mitigation measures mainly early warning awareness, rescue
   measure, relief, and post-flood rehabilitation programs etc. Disaster
   Management Bureaus of both the countries have already conducted many
   trainings, workshops and seminars to disseminate scientific knowledge
   and coping up practices to disaster managers and to create public
   awareness. Besides the contemporary approaches to mitigating flood
   effects, people of these countries have coped with floods through
   generations relying on traditional/indigenous knowledge and other local
   adaptation practices. It is crucial that along with scientific process,
   indigenous, traditional and conventional practices are to be integrated
   for a national and regional policy and this should be achieved through a
   participatory process that engages policy makers and relevant
   stakeholders. This paper has analyzed the vulnerability to floods,
   impacts and the coping strategies in Bangladesh and Nepal and focused on
   recommending a long-term mitigation policy. (C) 2015 The Author.

Title = {Building capacity on ecosystem-based adaptation strategy to cope with
   extreme events and sea-level rise on the Uruguayan coast},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {504-522},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to show a case study of ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) measures to increase coastal system's resilience to
   extreme weather events and sea-level rise (SLR) implemented at Kiyu
   (Uruguayan coast of the Rio de la Plata river estuary).
   Design/methodology/approach A participatory process involving the
   community and institutional stakeholders was carried out to select and
   prioritise adaptation measures to reduce the erosion of sandy beaches,
   dunes and bluffs due to extreme wind storm surge and rainfall, SLR and
   mismanagement practices. The recovery of coastal ecosystems was
   implemented through soft measures (green infrastructure) such as
   revegetation with native species, dune regeneration, sustainable
   drainage systems and the reduction of use pressures.
   Findings Main achievements of this case study include capacity building
   of municipal staff and stakeholders, knowledge exchanges with
   national-level decision makers and scientists and the incorporation of
   EbA approaches by subnational-level coastal governments. To consolidate
   EbA, the local government introduced innovations in the coastal
   management institutional structure.
   Originality/value The outcomes of the article include, besides the
   increase in the resilience of social-ecological systems, the
   strengthening of socio-institutional behaviour, structure and
   sustainability. This experience provides insights for developing a
   strategy for both Integrated Coastal Management and climate adaptation
   at the national scale.},

   Cameroon},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {1037-1051},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Campo coastal area. Variables of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
   capacity are described and assessed based on the community's perception
   and biophysical evidence. Historical changes in rainfall and temperature
   variables, mangrove cover and occurrence of extreme climatic events are
   taken as indicators of exposure. Losses of property and income structure
   are used as indicators of sensitivity. Human, natural, social, financial
   and physical assets are used as elements of adaptive capacity. Focus
   group discussions were held with key informants in 12 settlements, and a
   survey was conducted with 150 household representatives (14 Bagyeli
   pygmies and 136 Bantou) to gather perceptions on climate change and
   adaptation strategies. Results show evidence of increased -vulnerability
   due to decreasing rainfall and irregular rainfall patterns, increasing
   occurrences of extreme climatic events and increased levels of coastal
   erosion. These have resulted in several effects, most significantly in
   the decline of agricultural production, reported by 57\% of respondents,
   and damages to housing reported by 30\% of respondents. Adaptive
   capacities are low. > 60\% of respondents do not use any adaptation
   strategy. All sectors considered, the identified responses to climate
   related phenomena include early harvesting of crop, farm abandonment,
   change of productive activity, change of farm location, house
   reinforcement. The study concludes that households living here are
   susceptible to the possible impacts of climate change. Income
   diversification, mangrove afforestation and climate education should be
   considered as priorities for adaptation in this area.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper presents a new hybrid island model genetic algorithm (HIMGA)
   to solve the well-known job shop scheduling problem (ISSP) with the
   objective of makespan minimization. To improve the effectiveness of the
   island model genetic algorithm (IMGA), we have proposed a new naturally
   inspired self-adaptation phase strategy that is capable of striking a
   better balance between diversification and intensification of the search
   process. In the proposed self-adaptation phase strategy, the best
   individuals are recruited to perform a local search using tabu search
   (TS), and the worst ones are recruited to perform a global search using
   a combination of 3 classical random mutation operators. The proposed
   algorithm is tested on 76 benchmark instances, with the proposed
   self-adaptation strategy, and without it using the classical
   alternatives, and also compared with other 15 algorithms recently
   reported in the literature. Computational results verify the
   improvements achieved by the proposed self-adaptation strategy, and show
   the superiority of the proposed algorithm over 13 of the compared works
   in terms of solution quality, and validate its effectiveness. (C) 2015

Title = {Targeting property flood resilience in flood risk management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this article, we evaluate property flood resilience (PFR) to manage
   pluvial and combined tidal/ fluvial flood risks. We achieve this by
   evaluating flood risk and intervention targeting strategies across a
   case study in Bristol (UK) using data types generally available for
   preliminary option assessment. We investigate opportunities for
   mitigating flood damages within catchments using PFR and evaluate two
   targeting strategies: Installing PFR across strategic areas of a
   catchment and targeting interventions at specific high-risk properties.
   We find that individually targeting PFR is more effective than focusing
   resources on specific high-risk areas. Targeting pluvial flood measures
   at individual properties across our case study provides an average
   annual benefit per property of approximately 750 pound more than
   applying zonal targeting, supporting use of high-resolution modelling in
   surface water management, and highlighting the applicability of PFR to
   manage damages at specific high-risk properties which may not fall under
   the protection of community level defences. A similar approach provides
   the best outcomes for fluvial targeting; however, the hazard is more
   concentrated and so a zonal targeting approach may be more acceptable.
   Overall, we find resistance based PFR an effective intervention to
   mitigate damages, however complementary strategies are required when
   managing extreme flooding.},

Abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provides a globally significant
   demonstration of the effectiveness of large-scale networks of marine
   reserves in contributing to integrated, adaptive management.
   Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits
   of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef
   habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity
   conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than
   smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit
   overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating,
   crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which
   consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef
   ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of
   compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take
   zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses
   comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions
   illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice
   conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine
   reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic
   analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting
   environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by
   reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent
   implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of
   environmental condition and management and links to policy responses,
   key aspects of adaptive management. Given the major threat posed by
   climate change, the expanded network of marine reserves provides a
   critical and cost-effective contribution to enhancing the resilience of
   the Great Barrier Reef.},

Title = {In Vitro Evaluation of Different Dietary Methane Mitigation Strategies},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Dietary methane mitigation strategies do not necessarily
   make food production from ruminants more energy-efficient, but reducing
   methane (CH4) in the atmosphere immediately slows down global warming,
   helping to keep it within 2 degrees C above the pre-industrial baseline.
   There is no single most efficient strategy for mitigating enteric CH4
   production from domestic ruminants on forage-based diets. This study
   assessed a wide variety of dietary CH4 mitigation strategies in the
   laboratory, to provide background for future studies with live animals
   on the efficiency and feasibility of dietary manipulation strategies to
   reduce CH4 production. Among different chemical and plant-derived
   inhibitors and potential CH4-reducing diets assessed, inclusion of the
   natural antimethanogenic macroalga Asparagopsis taxiformis showed the
   strongest, and dose-dependent, CH4 mitigating effect, with the least
   impact on rumen fermentation parameters. Thus, applying Asparagopsis
   taxiformis at a low daily dose was the best potential dietary mitigation
   strategy tested, with promising long-term effects, and should be further
   studied in diets for lactating dairy cows.
   Abstract We assessed and ranked different dietary strategies for
   mitigating methane (CH4) emissions and other fermentation parameters,
   using an automated gas system in two in vitro experiments. In experiment
   1, a wide range of dietary CH4 mitigation strategies was tested. In
   experiment 2, the two most promising CH4 inhibitory compounds from
   experiment 1 were tested in a dose-response study. In experiment 1, the
   chemical compounds 2-nitroethanol, nitrate, propynoic acid, p-coumaric
   acid, bromoform, and Asparagopsis taxiformis (AT) decreased predicted in
   vivo CH4 production (1.30, 21.3, 13.9, 24.2, 2.00, and 0.20 mL/g DM,
   respectively) compared with the control diet (38.7 mL/g DM). The
   2-nitroethanol and AT treatments had lower molar proportions of acetate
   and higher molar proportions of propionate and butyrate compared with
   the control diet. In experiment 2, predicted in vivo CH4 production
   decreased curvilinearly, molar proportions of acetate decreased, and
   propionate and butyrate proportions increased curvilinearly with
   increased levels of AT and 2-nitroethanol. Thus 2-nitroethanol and AT
   were the most efficient strategies to reduce CH4 emissions in vitro, and
   AT inclusion additionally showed a strong dose-dependent CH4 mitigating
   effect, with the least impact on rumen fermentation parameters.},

Title = {Fostering coastal resilience to climate change vulnerability in

Abstract = {This paper describes a comparative study of four different cases on
   vulnerability, hazards and adaptive capacity to climate threats in
   coastal areas and communities in four developing countries: Bangladesh,
   Brazil, Cameroon and Uruguay. Coastal areas are vulnerable to sea-level
   rise (SLR), storm surges and flooding due to their (i) exposure, (ii)
   concentration of settlements, many of which occupied by less advantaged
   groups and (iii) the concentration of assets and services seen in these
   areas. The objective of the paper is twofold: (i) to evaluate current
   evidence of coastal vulnerability and adaptive capacity and (ii) to
   compare adaptation strategies being implemented in a sample of
   developing countries, focusing on successful ones. The followed approach
   for the case evaluation is based on (i) documenting observed threats and
   damages, (ii) using indicators of physical and socioeconomic
   vulnerability and adaptive capacity status and (iii) selecting examples
   of successful responses. Major conclusions based on cross-case
   comparison are (a) the studied countries show different vulnerability,
   adaptive capacity and implementation of responses, (b) innovative
   community-based (CBA) and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and (c) early
   warning systems are key approaches and tools to foster climate
   resilience. A recommendation to foster the resilience of coastal
   communities and services is that efforts in innovative adaptation
   strategies to sea-level rise should be intensified and integrated with
   climate risk management within the national adaption plans (NAPAs) in
   order to reduce the impacts of hazards.},

Abstract = {Communities living on remote islands are often viewed as among the most
   exposed and vulnerable to climate change impacts. This study uses the
   Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to investigate how indigenous
   communities living on two physically different islands in Torres Strait,
   Australia, experience what they consider to be the impacts of climate
   change in relation to their daily lives. During this process, a series
   of natural, physical, and socio-cultural limits and barriers to climate
   change adaptation were identified on Boigu, a low-lying mud island
   inundated by the sea during high tides and storm surges. As a volcanic
   island, Erub's elevation is higher but significant community
   infrastructure, housing, and cultural sites are located on the low
   coastal fringe. No immediate limits to climate change adaptation were
   identified on Erub, but physical and socio-cultural barriers were
   revealed. Limits to climate change adaptation occur when adaptation
   actions fail to protect the things valued by those affected, or few
   adaptation options are available. Barriers to climate change adaptation
   may be overcome if recognised and addressed but can become entrenched
   limits if they are ignored. Within the participating communities, such
   limits and barriers included (a) restricted adaptation options due to
   limited access to particular livelihood assets; (b) difficulty engaging
   with government processes to secure external support; and (c) people's
   place-based values, which evoke a reluctance to relocate or retreat.},

Abstract = {Mangroves are increasingly recognized for their role in supporting
   adaptation to climate change and variability. However, knowledge about
   how climate change and variability affect mangrove ecosystem services
   (MES) and their role in supporting coastal communities to adaption is
   limited in Tanzania. We used participatory rural appraisal methods and
   field observations to explore local communities' perceptions of climate
   change and variability, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies
   in the mangroves of the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania. Decrease in rainfall,
   increased temperatures, coastal flooding, and the incidence of sea level
   rise were identified as key variables associated with a changing climate
   in the delta. Perceived climatic stresses included damaged fish breeding
   sites, altered climate regulation and a decrease in coastal protection
   and flood control. Decline in crop, fish and honey production were
   perceived as the main impacts on community livelihoods, although there
   were significant differences across occupational groups. Dependence on
   MES in times of shocks, such as when agriculture production fails,
   switching of occupation, crop diversification, fishing in deep waters
   and migration to other areas provided potential adaptation options.
   Although the reported perceptions related to climate change or
   variability are not explicit, they both have negative consequences to
   mangrove dependent communities' livelihoods.},

Abstract = {The Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear accident presents challenging
   circumstances for disaster recovery in coastal communities, as ongoing
   uncertainties around the nuclear plant's decommissioning may create new
   risks in the future. Within disaster risk studies, inherent resilience -
   informal practices of resilience sustained through social memory and
   everyday actions - is seen as important for longer-term recovery. Yet
   whilst inherent resilience has been studied for acute disasters like
   earthquakes and hurricanes, less is known about inherent resilience
   under major and long-term environmental change of the kind seen in
   Fukushima. Through interview-based research in the Soma area of
   Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, this paper thus evaluates the potential for
   inherent resilience practices to support recovery when communities may
   have to respond multiple times as new setbacks emerge. We show that
   despite the challenging situation in Soma, inherent resilience practices
   have helped recovery on the coast by re-establishing a sense of identity
   and purpose for fishing communities in particular. Equally, however, we
   also find that ongoing uncertainty about the nuclear plant and emerging
   pressures linked to climate change make the full re-establishment of
   some cultural practices associated with inherent resilience difficult.
   Our findings contribute to existing research by showing that although
   inherent resilience may well help communities maintain core functions in
   a way formal institutional support cannot, changes to the physical
   environment of the kind seen in Fukushima may affect daily living and
   social relations to the extent it becomes difficult to undertake
   practices necessary to sustain social memory and community relations.},

Abstract = {This analysis reports on the projected cost of Alaska's public
   infrastructure at risk from rapid climate change. Specifically, we
   coupled projections of future climate with engineering rules of thumb to
   estimate how thawing permafrost, increased flooding, and increased
   coastal erosion affect annualized replacement costs for nearly 16,000
   structures. We conclude that climate change could add \$3.6-\$6.1
   billion (+10\% to +20\% above normal wear and tear) to future costs for
   public infrastructure from now to 2030 and \$5.6-\$7.6 billion (+10\% to
   +12\%) from now to 2080. These estimates take into account different
   possible levels of climate change and assume agencies strategically
   adapt infrastructure to changing conditions. In addition to implementing
   a risk-based economic analysis of climate change impacts, this research
   effort demonstrates that implementing plausible adaptation strategies
   could offset impacts by up to 45\% over the long-run. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper explores how Australia's Indigenous peoples understand and
   respond to climate change impacts on their traditional land and seas.
   Our results show that: (i) Indigenous peoples are observing
   modifications to their country due to climate change, and are doing so
   in both ancient and colonial time scales; (ii) the ways that climate
   change terminology is discursively understood and used is fundamental to
   achieving deep engagement and effective adaptive governance; (iii)
   Indigenous peoples in Australia exhibit a high level of agency via
   diverse approaches to climate adaptation; and (iv) humour is perceived
   as an important cultural component of engagement about climate change
   and adaptation. However, wider governance regimes consistently attempt
   to ``upscale{''} Indigenous initiatives into their own culturally
   governed frameworks - or ignore them totally as they ``don't fit{''}
   within neoliberal policy regimes. We argue that an opportunity exists to
   acknowledge the ways in which Indigenous peoples are agents of their own
   change, and to support the strategic localism of Indigenous adaptation
   approaches through tailored and place-based adaptation for traditional
   country.},

Abstract = {In coastal regions of the U.S. maritime transportation system,
   compelling reasons exist for implementing measures for climate change
   adaptation. As the effects of climate change amplify the impacts of
   natural hazards, a critical aspect of the nation's overall resiliency
   includes the ability of the maritime and coastal sectors to recover
   effectively from external shocks and to adapt to changing environmental
   conditions in order to continue to provide the services the nation
   relies upon for economic viability and homeland security. This requires
   adaptation for physical infrastructure as well as organizational,
   operational, and community elements throughout the maritime
   transportation system. This paper provides a literature review of port
   climate adaptation approaches, which highlights the established need and
   opportunities for collaboration among coastal stakeholders to implement
   climate adaptation in port communities. The current lack of federal
   support in the United States for climate adaptation in the maritime
   sector emphasizes the need for novel methods and approaches to
   facilitate adaptation at individual port and regional levels. A case
   study from the port community of Hampton Roads, Virginia provides an
   example of the time and effort dedicated to stakeholder collaboration to
   encourage local understanding of climate risks in order to facilitate
   successful adaptation.},

   Changing Climate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The present work aims at presenting an approach on implementing
   appropriate mitigation measures for the upgrade of rubble mound
   breakwaters protecting harbors and/or marinas against increasing future
   marine hazards and related escalating exposure to downtime risks. This
   approach is based on the reliability analysis of the studied structure
   coupled with economic optimization techniques. It includes the
   construction of probability distribution functions for all the
   stochastic variables of the marine climate (waves, storm surges, and sea
   level rise) for present and future conditions, the suggestion of
   different mitigation options for upgrading, the construction of a fault
   tree providing a logical succession of all events that lead to port
   downtime for each alternative mitigation option, and conclusively, the
   testing of a large number of possible alternative geometries for each
   option. A single solution is selected from the total sample of
   acceptable geometries for each upgrading concept that satisfy a
   probabilistic constraint in order to minimize the total costs of
   protection. The upgrading options considered in the present work include
   the construction or enhancement of a crown wall on the breakwater crest,
   the addition of the third layer of rocks above the primary armor layer
   of the breakwater (combined with crest elements), the attachment of a
   berm on the primary armor layer, and the construction of a detached
   low-crested structure in front of the breakwater. The proposed
   methodology is applied to an indicative rubble mound breakwater with an
   existing superstructure. The construction of a berm on the existing
   primary armor layer of the studied breakwater (port of Deauville,
   France), seems to be advantageous in terms of optimized total costs
   compared to other mitigation options.},

Abstract = {The International Workshop on Reducing Vulnerability of Agriculture and
   Forestry to Climate Variability and Climate Change held in Ljubljana,
   Solvenia, from 7 to 9 October 2002 addressed a range of important issues
   relating to climate variability, climate change, agriculture, and
   forestry including the state of agriculture and forestry and
   agrometeological information, and potential adaptation strategies for
   agriculture and forestry to changing climate conditions and other
   pressures. There is evidence that global warming over the last
   millennium has already resulted in increased global average annual
   temperature and changes in rainfall, with the 1990s being likely the
   warmest decade in the Northern Hemisphere at least. During the past
   century, changes in temperature patterns have, for example, had a direct
   impact on the number of frost days and the length of growing seasons
   with significant implications for agriculture and forestry. Land cover
   changes, changes in global ocean circulation and sea surface temperature
   patterns, and changes in the composition of the global atmosphere are
   leading to changes in rainfall. These changes may be more pronounced in
   the tropics. For example, crop varieties grown in the Sahel may not be
   able to withstand the projected warming trends and will certainly be at
   risk due to projected lower amounts of rainfall as well. Seasonal to
   interannual climate forecasts will definitely improve in the future with
   a better understanding of dynamic relationships. However, the main issue
   at present is how to make better use of the existing information and
   dispersion of knowledge to the farm level. Direct participation by the
   farming communities in pilot projects on agrometeorological services
   will be essential to determine the actual value of forecasts and to
   better identify the specific user needs. Old (visits, extension radio)
   and new (internet) communication techniques, when adapted to local
   applications, may assist in the dissemination of useful information to
   the farmers and decision makers. Some farming systems with an inherent
   resilience may adapt more readily to climate pressures, making long-term
   adjustments to varying and changing conditions. Other systems will need
   interventions for adaptation that should be more strongly supported by
   agrometeorological services for agricultural producers. This applies,
   among others, to systems where pests and diseases play an important
   role. Scientists have to guide policy makers in fostering an environment
   in which adaptation strategies can be effected. There is a clear need
   for integrating preparedness for climate variability and climate change.
   In developed countries, a trend of higher yields, but with greater
   annual fluctuations and changes in cropping patterns and crop calendars
   can be expected with changing climate scenarios. Shifts in projected
   cropping patterns can be disruptive to rural societies in general.
   However, developed countries have the technology to adapt more readily
   to the projected climate changes. In many developing countries, the
   present conditions of agriculture and forestry are already marginal, due
   to degradation of natural resources, the use of inappropriate
   technologies and other stresses. For these reasons, the ability to adapt
   will be more difficult in the tropics and subtropics and in countries in
   transition. Food security will remain a problem in many developing
   countries.
   Nevertheless, there are many examples of traditional knowledge,
   indigenous technologies and local innovations that can be used
   effectively as a foundation for improved frming systems. Before
   developing adaptation strategies, it is essential to learn from the
   actual difficulties faced by farmers to cope with risk management at the
   farm level. Agrometeorologists must play an important role in assisting
   farmers with the development of feasible strategies to adapt to climate
   variability and climate change. Agrometeorologists should also advise
   national policy makers on the urgent need to cope with the
   vulnerabilities of agriculture and forestry to climate variability and
   climate change. The workshop recommendations were largely limited to
   adaptation. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate variability and
   climate change is of high priority for nearly all countries, but
   developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Effective measures to
   cope with vulnerability and adaptation need to be developed at all
   levels. Capacity building must be integrated into adaptation measures
   for sustainable agricultural development strategies. Consequently,
   nations must develop strategies that effectively focus on specific
   regional issues to promote sustainable development.},

Abstract = {While people around the world are increasingly facing various

   erosions as well as unpredictable rainfall patterns. All of these
   climate related stresses directly contribute to the region's increasing
   exposure to saltwater intrusion in coastal lands and freshwater sources.
   While a majority of the previous research has focused on community-based
   climate adaptation, there has been limited attention on how gender
   differences shape local farmers' climate adaptation strategies. Using
   mixed-methods research, this article highlights the ways in which
   male-headed and female-headed farming households have differential
   access to locally available adaptation resources along with associated
   constraints or opportunities for adaptation and disaster risk reduction
   strategies vary substantially. Our findings suggest female-headed farms
   are less likely to sell their farmland or migrate away in search of
   non-farm income due to normative gendered expectations and
   socio-cultural restrictions. Therefore, female farmers are forced to
   pursue in-place farming adaptation strategies with limited external
   resources while relying on informal social networks for weather and
   climate information.},

Abstract = {Climate change will introduce changes in air and sea water temperature,
   rainfall, among others. This will affect water resources, food
   production, public health, etc. To assess the impacts of climate change
   is a prerequisite to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies. In
   this study the impacts of climate change on paddy irrigation water
   demands in Korea have been analyzed. Dynamically downscaled 27x27km grid
   future climate data for the SRES A2 scenario and the observed baseline
   climatology dataset were used. A geographic information system was used
   to produce maps showing the spatial changes in irrigation water
   requirements for rice paddies. The results showed that the growing
   season mean temperature and rainfall for future scenarios were projected
   to increase. The effect of ETo increase due to temperature increase was
   larger than that of rainfall increase on paddy irrigation requirement.
   Therefore the paddy irrigation requirement was projected to increase in
   the future. The total volumetric irrigation water demand was projected
   to increase by 2.8\% (2020s), 4.9\% (2050s) and 4.5\% (2080s). The
   temporal and spatial variations were large and should be considered in
   irrigation water resource planning and management in the future.

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increased rates of urbanization and industrialization of the 20th
   and 21st centuries have dramatically changed the land use and cover of
   modern cities, contributing to the degradation of the urban microclimate
   and the rise of the ambient urban air temperatures. Given the multiple
   negative energy, environmental and social consequences of urban warming,
   the present paper summarizes the findings of previous studies, assessing
   the main causes of the phenomenon along with the key investigation
   methods involving experimental and computational approaches. There
   follows a description of the most common mitigations, and adaption
   strategies towards the attenuation of urban warming are described. The
   analyzed elements include the addition of green spaces such as trees,
   grass and green roofs; changes on the albedo of the urban surfaces and
   water-based techniques, as well as a combination of them. The discussion
   of the reported findings in the existing literature clearly reflects the
   impact of urban morphology on the outdoor thermal environment, providing
   also useful information for professionals and urban planners involved at
   the phase of decision-making.},

Title = {Wetland Utilization and Adaptation Practice of a Coastal Megacity: A
   Case Study of Chongming Island, Shanghai, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Coastal urban areas are faced with risks induced by global warming and
   sea level rise, which puts pressure on regional sustainable development.
   In particular, land use adjustment is closely related to climate change
   for a coastal megacity. Coastal wetlands on the edge of the megacity
   represent a vulnerable ecosystem and a key area in terms of the
   resilient adaptation strategy. However, the interrelationship between
   the development of these wetlands and the megacity's adaptation practice
   has not been sufficiently analyzed. From a historical perspective, based
   on document synthesis and field investigation, we attempt in this study
   to reveal long-term land use stages and driving factors in association
   with urban marginal wetlands, with a special reference to eastern
   Chongming Island, Shanghai. On such a basis, the future adaptation
   strategy of the megacity is evaluated. The analytical results show that
   this island has witnessed three periods of time for wetland utilization:
   traditional land use for salt production, fishery and agriculture before
   1950, industrialization with rapid reclamation during 1950-2001, and the
   land use pattern orientated toward wetland ecosystem protection after
   2002. The driving forces include sediment budget on the coast, wetland
   morphodynamic processes, sea level rise, population growth, and resource
   management policy changes. Transformation occurred between the wetland
   utilization stages in response to the changes of these forces.
   Furthermore, facing future climate change, there are different options
   of adaptation, e.g., retreatment and adherence. It may not be suitable
   for coastal cities with a large population to take the first option. It
   will be suitable for coastal communities to adhere to the location, if
   solutions to the problems of flooding risk, coastal erosion, and the
   maintenance of coastal facilities can be found. For eastern Chongming
   wetlands, as a key experimental area for ecosystem-oriented development
   in Shanghai, the transformation from the reclamation-oriented
   utilization toward the protection of wetland ecosystems represents the
   first step toward the latter option. We suggest that the next steps
   would be to maintain the ecological niche of the wetlands, to create new
   approaches to coastal engineering with contributions from the ecosystem,
   and to provide better ecosystem services.},

Title = {An assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation in South Asian
   agriculture},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {517-534},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to synthesize the impacts of
   climate change on agriculture and assess the status of policies,
   programs and strategies to adapt small farmholders to climate change in
   South Asia.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors collected secondary
   information through a desktop review of policy documents, action plans
   and published reports. Face-to-face interviews with policy makers,
   agriculture and climate experts representing the government,
   non-governmental organizations, international development agencies and
   the private sector were also conducted to validate the secondary
   information.
   Findings - The results revealed that agriculture is the dominant
   economic mainstay providing livelihood to over 70 per cent, employing 60
   per cent of the labor force and contributing about 22 per cent of the
   regional gross domestic product. Climate impacts, such as floods, sea
   level rise and salt intrusion, increased frequency and intensity of
   storms, and pests combined with increasing water scarcity continue to
   reduce arable land, reduce yield of crops and threaten the food security
   of farmers. Adaptation efforts include using improved varieties of crop;
   changing cropping patterns and planting seasons; and water conservation
   techniques. However, progress remains low because of a lack of adequate
   technical knowledge and financial resources.
   Originality/value - The amount of published literature on climate change
   and its impact on agriculture is increasing, but there is little effort
   to analyze and document impacts and strategies to adapt small farm
   holders to climate change at a landscape level, particularly in South
   Asia. This study fills in this gap and will serve as a valuable source
   of information for those wishing to conduct research or develop
   adaptation strategies for any of the four countries of Bangladesh,
   Bhutan, India and Nepal.},

Title = {Approaches to managing global sourcing risk},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {67-81},
Abstract = {Purpose - Global sourcing can bring many benefits to organisations, but
   it can also expose them to a number of risks. The purpose of this study
   is to understand how managers assess global sourcing risks across the
   entire supply chain and what actions they take to mitigate those risks.
   Design/methodology/approach - A multiple case study approach was used,
   involving 15 cases in seven different industries. Each case consisted of
   interviews with manager; directly involved in the global sourcing
   decision, supported by documentary evidence. A cross-case analysis was
   conducted to analyse patterns across different industries.
   Findings - The study revealed that most companies do not have a
   structured supply chain risk management and mitigation system.
   Nevertheless they do use a number of informal approaches to cope with
   risk. The paper proposes that a multidisciplinary approach is required
   when dealing with global sourcing risks. It presents a classification of
   risks covering four categories: supply risk, process and control risks,
   environmental and sustainability risks, and demand risks.
   Originality/value - The paper addresses a research gap concerning
   managers' approaches to assessing and mitigating supply chain risk in a
   global context. In this context, this study proposes a new
   categorisation for global sourcing risks and offers a characterisation
   of global sourcing risk mitigation strategies applicable to different
   industries.},

Title = {Re-examining policy stability in climate adaptation through a lock-in
   perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Abstract = {Responding to current and future climate change demands urgent,
   transformative adaptation, yet in many policy systems inaction continues
   to prevail. This paper examines apparent resistance to policy change and
   the persistence of business-as-usual through a `lock-in perspective',
   which means that attention is paid to how reinforcing mechanisms drive
   stabilisation and resistance in policy systems. Offering a fresh
   synthesis of known lock-in mechanisms in the literature, this paper
   explores the role of those mechanisms in two empirical cases of coastal
   adaptation: England (U.K.) and Schleswig-Holstein (Germany). While
   several known lock-mechanisms are observable, some are newly identified
   in this adaptation context. We offer a critical reflection on the added
   value of the lock-in perspective for understanding policy stability. In
   turn, the identification of self- and mutually reinforcing mechanisms
   provides a much-needed foundation for targeted policy interventions and
   efforts to `unlock' climate adaptation pathways.},

Abstract = {IPCC has criticised Aotearoa/New Zealand for not being pro-active with
   adaptation measures to date. However, some initiatives have been
   developed and actioned mainly by Maori and wider community groups. Local
   government has been given the mandate from central government to lead
   the way in climate change adaption and this chapter outlines some of the
   initiatives and challenges towards effective adaptation. A case study
   from the South Island hapu, Kati Huirapa is one example of a Maori-led
   initiative to providing effective and culturally responsive actions for
   future sustainability of vulnerable resources. This chapter promotes a
   Matauraka-a-Iwi approach to climate change that best illustrates the
   idea of states of transition and renegotiating relationships in order to
   move forward.},

Title = {An integrated method for assessing climate-related risks and adaptation
   alternatives in urban areas},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {31-50},
Abstract = {The urban environment is a complex structure with interlinked social,
   ecological and technical structures. Global warming is expected to have
   a broad variety of impacts, which will add to the complexity. Climate
   changes will force adaptation, to reduce climate-related risks.
   Adaptation measures can address one aspect at the time, or aim for a
   holistic approach to avoid maladaptation. This paper presents a
   systematic, integrated approach for assessing alternatives for reducing
   the risks of heat waves, flooding and air pollution in urban settings,
   with the aim of reducing the risk of maladaptation. The study includes
   strategies covering different spatial scales, and both the current
   climate situation and the climate predicted under climate change
   scenarios. The adaptation strategies investigated included increasing
   vegetation; selecting density, height and colour of buildings; and
   retreat or resist (defend) against sea-level rise. Their effectiveness
   was assessed with regard to not only flooding, heat stress and air
   quality but also with regard to resource use, emissions to air (incl.
   GHG), soil and water, and people's perceptions and vulnerability. The
   effectiveness of the strategies were ranked on a common scale (from -3
   to 3) in an integrated assessment. Integrated assessments are
   recommended, as they help identify the most sustainable solutions, but
   to reduce the risk of maladaptation they require experts from a variety
   of disciplines. The most generally applicable recommendation, derived
   from the integrated assessment here, taking into account both expertise
   from different municipal departments, literature surveys, life cycle
   assessments and publics perceptions, is to increase the urban greenery,
   as it contributes to several positive aspects such as heat stress
   mitigation, air quality improvement, effective storm-water and
   flood-risk management, and it has several positive social impacts. The
   most favourable alternative was compact, mid-rise, light coloured
   building design with large parks/green areas and trees near buildings.

Title = {Formulating Operational Mitigation Options and Examining Intra-Urban
   Social Inequality Using Evidence-Based Urban Warming Effects},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Human-induced climate change is bringing warmer conditions to the
   Southwestern United States. More extreme urban heat island (UHI) effects
   are not distributed equally, and often impact socioeconomically
   vulnerable populations the most. This study aims to quantify how land
   surface temperature (LST) changes with increasing green vegetation
   landscapes, identify disparities in urban warming exposure, and provide
   a method for developing evidence-based mitigation options. ECOSTRESS LST
   products, detailed land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and
   socioeconomic variables were used to facilitate the analysis. We
   examined the relationship between LST and the fractions of LULC and
   socioeconomic factors in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. A machine
   learning approach (Random Forest) was used to model LST changes by
   taking the LULC fractions (scenario-based approaches) as the explanatory
   variables. We found that vegetation features-trees, grass, and
   shrubs-were the most important factors mitigating UHI effects during the
   summer daytime. Trees tended to lower surface temperature more
   effectively, whereas we observed elevated daytime LST most often near
   roads. Meanwhile, higher summer daytime temperatures were observed on
   land with unmanaged soil compared to the built environment. We found
   that affluent neighborhoods experienced lower temperatures, while
   low-income communities experienced higher temperatures. Scenario
   analyses suggest that replacing 50\% of unmanaged soil with trees could
   reduce average summer daytime temperatures by 1.97 degrees C if the
   intervention was implemented across all of Phoenix and by 1.43 degrees C
   if implemented within the urban core only. We suggest that native trees
   requiring little to no additional water other than rainfall should be
   considered. We quantify mitigation options for urban warming effect
   under vegetation management interventions, and our results provide some
   vital insight into existing disparities in UHI impacts. Future UHI
   mitigation strategies seriously need to consider low-income communities
   to improve environmental justice. These can be used to guide the
   development of sustainable and equitable policies for vegetation
   management to mitigate heat exposure impacts on communities.},

Title = {Influence of mitigation policy on ocean acidification},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {This study quantifies the relative impact on future ocean acidification
   of different aspects of global climate change mitigation policies, such
   as the year that global emissions peak, how fast they reduce after their
   peak, and the long term minimum emissions that are possible. Relative to
   a scenario where emissions peak in 2016 and then decrease by 1\% per
   year, further emissions reductions to 2, 3 and 4\% per year lead to the
   same impact minimum pH (by 2100) if emissions peak 10, 15 and 17 years
   later respectively. Over the same time scale, non-mitigation scenarios
   lead to a decrease of global mean surface pH of 7.67 to 7.81. Strong and
   urgent mitigation, emissions peaking in 2016 and reducing by 5\% per
   year, are shown to limit this minimum to 8.02. Minimum pH over longer
   timescales, the next 500 years, is largely determined by the minimum
   emission level that is attainable, owing to its relation with cumulative
   emissions. Citation: Bernie, D., J. Lowe, T. Tyrrell, and O. Legge

Title = {A planetary boundaries perspective on the sustainability: resilience
   relationship in the Kenyan tea supply chain},
Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine whether agricultural supply
   chains (ASC) can be simultaneously sustainable and resilient to
   ecological disruptions, using the Planetary Boundaries theory. The nine
   different Planetary Boundaries i.e. climatic change, biodiversity loss,
   biogeochemical, ocean acidification, land use, freshwater availability,
   stratosphere ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosols and chemical
   pollution are examined in relation to ASC sustainability and resilience.
   Kenya's tea upstream supply chain sustainability and resilience from the
   ecological point of view is questioned. This study adopts a multi-case
   study analysis approach of nine producer organisations from Kenya's tea
   supply chain. The data from the in-depth semi-structured interviews and
   a focus group discussion are analysed using thematic analysis. The
   Kenyan tea supply chain producers are not aware of all the nine
   planetary boundaries, although these impact on their resilience
   practices. They are engaged in pursuing both sustainability and
   resilience practices. They implement mainly environmental practices in
   relation to sustainability, while only a few of them are implementing
   resilience practices. The sustainability and resilience concepts were
   found to be interrelated, but resilience does not improve at the same
   pace as sustainability. It is suggested that the relationship between
   sustainability and resilience is non-linear. Limitations and future
   research avenues are also provided.},

Title = {Perceptions of practitioners: Managing marine protected areas for
   climate change resilience},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {18-28},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change is impacting upon global marine ecosystems and ocean wide
   changes in ecosystem properties are expected to continue. Marine
   Protected Areas (MPAs) have been implemented as a conservation tool
   throughout the world, primarily as a measure to reduce local impacts,
   but their usefulness and effectiveness is strongly related to climate
   change. MPAs may have a role in mitigation through effects on carbon
   sequestration, affect interactions between climatic effects and other
   drivers and be affected themselves as the distributions of protected
   species change over time. However, to date, few MPA programmes have
   directly considered climate change in the design, management or
   monitoring of an MPA network. This paper presents a series of
   international case studies from four locations: British Columbia,
   Canada; central California, USA; the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and
   the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand; to review perceptions of how climate
   change has been considered in the design, implementation, management and
   monitoring of MPAs. The results indicate that some MPA processes have
   already incorporated design criteria or principles for adaptive
   management, which address some of the potential impacts of climate
   change on MPAs. Key lessons include: i) Strictly protected marine
   reserves are considered essential for climate change resilience and will
   be necessary as scientific reference sites to understand climate change
   effects ii) Adaptive management of MPA networks is important but hard to
   implement iii) Strictly protected reserves managed as ecosystems are the
   best option for an uncertain future. Although the case studies addressed
   aspects of considering climate change within MPA networks and provided
   key lessons for the practical inclusion of these considerations, there
   are some significant challenges remaining. This paper provides new
   insights into the policy and practical challenges MPA managers face
   under climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Households' perception of flood risk and health impact of exposure to
   flooding in flood-prone informal settlements in the coastal city of
   Mombasa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {592-606},
Abstract = {Purpose - Mombasa City in Kenya is one of the most vulnerable towns to
   flood risk due to its low-lying coastal location. Those at the highest
   risk in the city are households living in the flood-prone informal
   settlements. However, little is known about the perception of these
   vulnerable households to the flood risks and its health impacts, which
   is important for developing effective long-term adaptation strategies.
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the general perception of the
   residents regarding flood risks, its impact on their health and their
   adaptation strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study surveyed 390 randomly selected
   households in three informal settlements in the city of Mombasa using a
   semi-structured questionnaire. This was supplemented with six focus
   group discussions (FDGs) and six key informant interviews (KIIs).
   Findings - The majority of respondent households perceive future
   flooding as high risk or severe with high negative health impact.
   Despite this, many do not evacuate their homes because they do not have
   alternative places to move to. Flooding was indicated to have had a
   negative physical and mental health impact on members of households.
   Although majority of households had taken some adaptation measures, most
   of these were short term, mainly due to financial constraints, lack of
   knowledge and government support. Perception of flood risk and gender
   were found to have a strong influence on taking long-term adaptation
   measures at the household level.
   Practical implications - Reducing flood risk and averting its health
   consequences in flood-prone informal settlements require empowering and
   supporting those living in these areas with ability to initiate
   long-term adaptation measures and creating awareness about future risks.
   Originality/value - This study provides evidence about how residents of
   flood-prone informal settlements perceive flood risk and how the
   exposures to perennial flooding impact their health. The paper augments
   existing knowledge of flood risk in poor urban neighborhoods of
   developing countries.},

Title = {Perceptions of climate change and water availability in the
   Mediterranean tourist sector A case study of the Muga River basin
   (Girona, Spain)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {552-569},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is understand these perceptions and
   identify main problems associated to climate change in order to design
   effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to guarantee the
   sustainability of tourism and natural resources. The Mediterranean basin
   is a leading international tourist destination and one that is
   particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although these
   effects are largely known, in-depth studies of how they and the
   associated risks are perceived by key tourism stakeholders have not been
   performed.
   Design/methodology/approach - Interviews were held with 31 hotels,
   campsites and rural lodgings in the Muga River basin in north-east
   Catalonia, in which both owners and managers were asked about their
   perceptions of climate change, effects and countermeasures.
   Findings - Perceptions of climate change and its effects varied
   according to the type of establishment and location (coast, cities or
   inland). Significant differences were observed for perceptions of how
   responsibilities for implementing mitigation and adaptation measures to
   counter the effects of climate change, including water shortages, should
   be shared out between the main agents with an interest in guaranteeing
   the sustainability of tourism, namely, government bodies, tourist
   establishments and clients. The predominant opinion, however, was that
   the bulk of the responsibility should lie with government bodies.
   Practical implications - Only when those responsible for running tourist
   establishments are aware of the risks of climate change, it will be
   possible to design and implement effective short-, medium- and long-term
   strategies aimed at strengthening the resilience of the tourist
   industry.
   Originality/value - The originality of this study lies in its novel
   methodology and approach, which involved analyzing perceptions of
   climate change, including water shortages and its effects among owners
   and managers of different types of tourist accommodation establishments
   in distinct parts of the same area.},

Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE \& AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {400-415},
Abstract = {As the body of literature on marine climate impacts accumulates the
   question is no longer whether marine ecosystems and their living
   resources are affected, but what we as scientists, managers and policy
   makers can do to prepare for the inevitable changes. In this study, the
   current literature on how fisheries, fisheries management and fishing
   communities react and adapt to projected climate impacts is reviewed.
   First, a brief background on adaptation research, including definitions
   of key terms and concepts is provided. Secondly, available frameworks
   and tools to assess and foster adaptation to climate change are outlined
   and discussed. Thirdly, case studies illustrating several key aspects
   (political, legal, economic, and social) influencing adaptation at the
   level of fisheries, communities and households worldwide are presented
   and compared. Finally, a brief synthesis of the main issues and their
   implications for adaptation within fisheries and fisheries management at
   large are identified and discussed. In summary, the study illustrates
   that while a great wealth of local and regional knowledge, as well as
   tools and approaches to foster adaptation exists, examples of concrete
   adaptation actions and measures are surprisingly few. This emphasizes
   the need to increase the general awareness of climate change impacts and
   to build a solid political, legal, financial and social infrastructure
   within which the available knowledge, tools and approaches can be set to
   practical use in implementing adaptation to climate change.},

Abstract = {Disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies and strategies are well
   established within the international development community, being
   utilised at the grassroots level to address all forms of hazards. An
   exacerbation and increase in meteorological hazards has in part been
   attributed to climate change. Climate change also contributes to
   noticeable seasonal fluctuations that severely affect natural resource
   based livelihoods. In response, a need in development policy has been
   identified to address climate change at the community level by helping
   those most affected through `climate change adaptation' (CCA)
   strategies. This paper explores the differences or, rather, the
   similarities between DRR and CCA through analysing climate-related DRR
   in Papua New Guinea (PNG) within the context of wider development
   policies. Ways forward are identified for international development
   policy supporting all forms of risk reduction through integrating DRR
   and CCA strategies. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Volume = {71},
Pages = {187-194},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {China is a country that is particularly negatively affected by the
   challenge of sea-level rise (SLR), which will increasingly threaten the
   country's coastlines. As a result, it is vital that China's local
   communities adapt to these impacts. This paper assesses how local
   decision-makers in coastal communities of Zhejiang Province perceive SLR
   adaptation and how the decision-makers act on these perceptions. We also
   investigate the effect of an information brochure on local
   decision-makers' knowledge, awareness, and policy actions regarding SLR
   adaptation. The results show that decision-makers located along the
   Zhejiang coast have little knowledge of climate change and SLR, and they
   do not place a high priority on the issue of SLR. While providing local
   decision-makers with relevant information could increase their knowledge
   and awareness of the need to act, it will not necessarily lead to
   action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Global warming increases the probability of extreme events and heat
   waves, intensified by Urban Heat Island phenomenon, triggering severe
   impacts on both human health and economy. The paper aims at developing a
   new methodological approach for the assessment of building ability to
   face rising temperatures, also considering the effects on the
   surrounding urban areas. It focuses on resilient retrofitting strategies
   need for building envelope according to three macro-categories:
   reliability, adaptability and mitigation ability. A set of indicators is
   defined to achieve a Response Index to cope with heat waves. The method
   is tested on reference building and its neighborhood. The selected
   strategies are investigated through an integrated and multilevel
   analysis with EnergyPlus and ENVI\_met, in three different cities with
   increasing summer temperature. The final comparative analysis is carried
   out through a multi-criteria analysis according to the identified
   indicators. The best responsive solutions result the green ones combined
   with high albedo, but the research highlights also some controversial
   aspects. The method can be a valid tool to support the decisional
   process about heat waves mitigation in the roadmap towards a more

Abstract = {Individuals are able to contribute in reducing vulnerability to climate
   change and extreme events. This study addresses the question of what
   motivates coastal dwellers to adapt proactively to rising sea-levels and
   associated flood events. Data were collected through a questionnaire
   survey that was carried out in Germany and Denmark. Two elements based
   on variables of the Protection Motivation Theory were constructed, which
   depict the perceptions of flood risk and household-level adaptation. In
   addition, individual and residence-related characteristics were
   included. First, descriptive statistical analysis on adaptation
   behaviour and the two elements was conducted. Then, multiple regression
   analysis was applied to determine which variables influence the total
   number of implemented adaptation measures. Finally, the implementation
   of single adaptation measures was investigated using binary logistic
   regression analysis. Results indicate that personal experience is the
   main explanatory factor for adaptation behaviour while cognitive
   variables and personal history are also important. The independent
   variables that we used can, to a large extent, predict the
   implementation of measures that require small investments in terms of
   efforts and costs. However, the implementation of high-investment
   measures cannot be explained based on these variables. Our findings
   suggest that risk communication in coastal management should also
   integrate variables related to adaptation behaviour, and further
   research is needed to better understand the implementation of
   high-investment adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {Indonesia is an archipelago blessed with the wealth of coastal
   resources, but also with the risk of natural hazards including tectonic
   earthquake and tsunami. This potential risk is high in the Purwodadi
   Subregency, Purworejo Regency, Indonesia, because of its location in an
   active subduction zone at the edge of the Indian Ocean. Therefore, this
   study was conducted in the region located on the southern coast of Java
   Island. The high probability of disaster in the area needs a proper
   coastal management strategy and mitigation measures. Hence, this study
   aims to establish an appropriate policy using the
   strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis. Furthermore, the
   data obtained from this novel analysis include the population and social
   vulnerability, geological conditions, landuse allocation, and disaster
   strategies. Each is carefully assessed and then incorporated into the
   matrix to obtain the result. In addition, the alternative strategies
   used are the development of disaster mitigation facilities,
   infrastructure, and institutional strengthening. (C) IJOG - 2021.},

Title = {Measuring local sea-level rise adaptation and adaptive capacity: A
   national survey in the United States},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) has increasingly manifested the need for adaptation
   in the United States (US) coastal areas. Few empirical studies have
   investigated the extent of local SLR adaptation and adaptive capacity on
   a national scale. To address this research gap, I conducted a national
   survey among 231 coastal localities in the US and obtained 86 individual
   copies of surveys, with a response rate of 37.2\%. I then employed
   multivariate regression models to examine the relationship between local
   actions and adaptive capacity while controlling for socioeconomic
   variations. Based on the survey results, I find that, at this nascent
   stage, the coastal localities are more actively investing in adaptation
   planning than actions. Among the adaptation actions, they generally
   preferred the protection and accommodation strategies to those of the
   managed retreat. Localities in this sample reported medium to low
   adaptive capacity, with leadership, funding, staff, and political
   environment being the weakest capacity elements. The regression results
   indicate that localities with higher adaptive capacity have been
   implementing more adaptation than those with limited capacity. This
   empirical research provides a first glance into local SLR adaptation and
   sheds light on the plausible pathways to building local adaptive
   capacity and improving coastal resilience through adaptation.},

Title = {Management adaptation of invertebrate fisheries to an extreme marine
   heat wave event at a global warming hot spot},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3583-3593},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An extreme marine heat wave which affected 2000 km of the midwest coast
   of Australia occurred in the 2010/11 austral summer, with sea-surface
   temperature (SST) anomalies of 2-5 degrees C above normal climatology.
   The heat wave was influenced by a strong Leeuwin Current during an
   extreme La Nina event at a global warming hot spot in the Indian Ocean.
   This event had a significant effect on the marine ecosystem with changes
   to seagrass/algae and coral habitats, as well as fish kills and southern
   extension of the range of some tropical species. The effect has been
   exacerbated by above-average SST in the following two summers, 2011/12
   and 2012/13. This study examined the major impact the event had on
   invertebrate fisheries and the management adaption applied. A 99\%
   mortality of Roei abalone (Haliotis roei) and major reductions in
   recruitment of scallops (Amusium balloti), king (Penaeus latisulcatus)
   and tiger (P. esculentus) prawns, and blue swimmer crabs were detected
   with management adapting with effort reductions or spatial/temporal
   closures to protect the spawning stock and restocking being evaluated.
   This study illustrates that fisheries management under extreme
   temperature events requires an early identification of temperature hot
   spots, early detection of abundance changes (preferably using
   pre-recruit surveys), and flexible harvest strategies which allow a
   quick response to minimize the effect of heavy fishing on poor
   recruitment to enable protection of the spawning stock. This has
   required researchers, managers, and industry to adapt to fish stocks
   affected by an extreme environmental event that may become more frequent
   due to climate change.},

Abstract = {Adequate methods to evaluate the extension of global and local damage on
   coral reefs, and to minimize it, are urgent. The Tropical Southwestern
   Atlantic reefs are partially protected by Marine Protected Areas (MPA)
   that apply spatial zoning as a management strategy. A resilience-based
   management approach was used to evaluate the effectiveness of no-take
   areas in improving reef resilience, inside the largest coastal MPA of
   Brazil. Ecological indicators were used to calculate resilience scores,
   to test the hypothesis that no-take reefs present higher resilience than
   tourism reefs. Score values indicated medium-high resilience for both.
   Despite the similar values, the contribution of the indicators to the
   score varied between reefs. Herbivorous fish biomass was the main
   indicator influencing higher scores. Management through spatial zoning
   and the compliance of this regulation raised the resilience of coral
   reefs. The main management actions recommended are the creation of
   no-take areas in coastal habitats such as mangroves and seagrass beds.},

Title = {Farmers' Perception and Efficacy of Adaptation Decisions to Climate
   Change},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change is viewed as the main obstacle to agricultural
   development in developing countries. The high dependence on agriculture
   and allied sectors makes many countries vulnerable to the climate change
   phenomenon. There is a gap in macro and micro-level understanding of
   climate change. Thoughtful farmers' perceptions and impacts of climate
   change on farming are fundamental for developing various mitigation and
   adaptation strategies. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was
   to understand the pattern of climate variability, farmers' perceptions
   about climate change, and farmers' adaptation strategies based on their
   socio-cultural background in the villages of Goa, on the west coast of
   India. The results reveal that about 62\% of the sampled farmers have
   experienced climate change in terms of meteorological indicators such as
   increased average temperature, decreased total rainfall, delayed onset
   of monsoon, and an increase in the length of the summer season. The
   temperature trend analysis (0.009 degrees C/year) validated farmers'
   perceptions, while the perception of rainfall differed (-1.49 mm/year).
   Farmers are convinced that climate change has affected their farming
   (declining crop and livestock productivity, water depletion, and other
   related farm operations). They strive to adapt to climate change through
   crop diversification, an integrated crop-livestock system, contingency
   crop planning, and the adaptation of new crops and varieties. This study
   could be helpful for policymakers to establish a climate-resilient
   agriculture system by ensuring timely availability of farm inputs,
   accurate weather forecasting, and encouraging insurance products for
   crop and livestock enterprises, which will help farmers cope with the
   changing climate to enhance their income and economic wellbeing.
   Further, adaption of integrated farming, agroforestry, and indigenous
   technical knowledge is imperative to combat the ill effects of climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise is one of the most concerning and costly effects of
   climate change. Resulting sea-level rise impacts may include failure or
   destruction of infrastructure, immobilization due to transportation
   system breakdown, and catastrophic saltwater contamination of water
   supplies. The problem of sea-level rise adaptation is characterized by
   deep uncertainty that makes it complex to evaluate the economic value of
   adaptation investments. The key element to evaluate the effectiveness of
   adaptation strategies is to quantify the long-term cost of physical
   networks under uncertain sea-level rise scenarios. In this paper, a
   simulation framework is created and tested to investigate the long-term
   impacts of sea-level rise on infrastructure systems in order to evaluate
   the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies. To this end, the
   transf ormation of infrastructure systems under various scenarios of
   sea-level rise and adaptation strategies is modeled using the proposed
   simulation framework. Then, the impacts of sea-level rise are determined
   in terms of the life cycle costs of infrastructure networks. These
   estimated costs are used for evaluating the feasibility of various
   adaptation strategies under future uncertain sea-level rise scenarios.
   The application of the proposed simulation framework is shown in a case
   study of a road network using the sea-level rise scenarios in Southeast
   Florida. The results of the analysis are threefold: (1) prioritization
   of infrastructure assets for adaptation investment; (2) identification
   of the right timing of adaptation investments for different links in an
   infrastructure network; and (3) evaluation of the present value of
   adaptation investments for the entire network. The results enable more
   informed decision-making in order to implement robust adaptation under
   uncertain sea-level rise scenarios.},

Abstract = {<list list-type={''}1{''} id={''}jpe12304-list-0001{''}> In this work,
   we hypothesized that in urban areas with reduced pollution levels, local
   climatic conditions can be an important driver of lichen diversity.
   Thus, lichen functional groups could be used to study the effects of the
   urban heat island, characterized by higher temperature and lower
   humidity in urban than in peri-urban areas. To test this hypothesis, we
   sampled functional groups of epiphytic lichens in 48 forest remnants of
   a Mediterranean urban area (Almada, Portugal). Of all tested functional
   groups (including those most closely associated with air pollution),
   groups related to water requirements showed the most significant
   correlations with surrounding artificial areas, roads and forest. These
   results suggest that the current major driver of lichen diversity is the
   climate within the urban area rather than air pollution, as frequently
   assumed. The analysis of local climate using meteorological data of
   temperature and humidity confirmed the existence of urban heat island in
   the study area.Synthesis and applications. The analysis of lichen
   functional groups gave an integrated response to the climatic
   modifications occurring in urban areas, namely to the urban heat island,
   suggesting that lichens can be used as a tool to evaluate the impact of
   urban areas on local climate and the effectiveness of mitigation and
   adaptation strategies if pollution levels are low.

Abstract = {This study maps current understanding and research trends on the human
   dimensions of climate change (HDCC) in the eastern and central Canadian
   Arctic. Developing a systematic literature review methodology, 117 peer
   reviewed articles are identified and examined using quantitative and
   qualitative methods. The research highlights the rapid expansion of HDCC
   studies over the last decade. Early scholarship was dominated by work
   documenting Inuit observations of climate change, with research
   employing vulnerability concepts and terminology now common. Adaptation
   studies which seek to identify and evaluate opportunities to reduce
   vulnerability to climate change and take advantage of new opportunities
   remain in their infancy. Over the last 5 years there has been an
   increase social science-led research, with many studies employing key
   principles of community-based research. We currently have baseline
   understanding of climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability
   in the region, but key gaps are evident. Future research needs to target
   significant geographic disparities in understanding, consider risks and
   opportunities posed by climate change outside of the subsistence hunting
   sector, complement case study research with regional analyses, and focus
   on identifying and characterizing sustainable and feasible adaptation
   interventions.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation options for natural systems are particularly
   challenging in high density urban settings. We model the vulnerability
   of estuarine vegetation (mangroves, saltmarshes and Casuarina forest) to
   sea level rise in Australia's most populous city, Sydney, and conduct a
   detailed assessment of impacts and adaptation options for a densely
   urbanised estuary, the Cooks River. Our modelling demonstrates a range
   of opportunities for the preservation and, in some cases, expansion of
   estuarine vegetation area under sea-level rise, though this is largely
   dependent on the degree of flexibility applied in the management of
   existing open space. Mangrove area increases under a high sea-level rise
   scenario, more so than under a low sea-level rise scenario, due to
   opportunities for landward colonisation. However, this would require
   estuarine vegetation expansion and land-use conversion of recreational,
   industrial or private land. Sediment nourishment emerges as a
   potentially cost-efficient means of preserving wetlands. The mix of
   wetland types is likely to change without active management, with higher
   proportion of mangrove and substantially less saltmarsh under all
   scenarios. Implementation of living shorelines, as opposed to hard
   defensive structures, could be incentivised. This could be achieved by
   planning concessions, `payment for ecosystem services' such as managing
   `blue carbon' values, and zoning controls that promote visual amenity
   and ecological adaptation.},

   Systems to Absorb Climate Extremes},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Enhancing the capacity of social-ecological systems (SES) to adapt to
   climate change is of crucial importance. While gradual climate change
   impacts have been the main focus of much recent research, much less is
   known about how SES are impacted by climate extremes and how they adapt.
   Here, based on an advanced conceptualization of social-ecological
   resilience, performed by an interdisciplinary group of scientists, we
   outline three major challenges for operationalizing the resilience
   concept with particular focus on climate extremes. First, we discuss the
   necessary steps required to identify and measure relevant variables for
   capturing the full response spectrum of the coupled social and
   ecological components of SES. Second, we examine how climate extreme
   impacts on coupling flows in SES can be quantified by learning from past
   societal transitions or adaptations to climate extremes and resulting
   changes in ecosystem service supply. Last, we explore how to identify
   management options for maintaining and enhancing social-ecological
   resilience under a changing regime of climate extremes. We conclude that
   multiple pathways within adaptation and mitigation strategies which
   enhance the adaptive capacity of SES to absorb climate extremes will
   open the way toward a sustainable future.},

   Climate Change: A Narrative Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This narrative review examined strategies for preparedness and response
   to mental health impacts of three forms of climate change from a
   services perspective: (1) acute and extreme weather events such as
   hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, (2) sub-acute or long-term events
   such as droughts and heatwaves; and (3) the prospect of long-term and
   permanent changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and
   an uninhabitable physical environment. Strategies for acute events
   included development and implementation of programs and practices for
   monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening
   individual and community resilience, training of community health
   workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available
   resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies
   for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and
   programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the
   secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood,
   health and well-being, population displacement, environmental
   degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes
   included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication
   interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate
   change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental
   conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience.},

Abstract = {Many coastal landscapes across Europe are undergoing change due to the
   impacts of a changing climate. In the context of coastal erosion,
   especially the question of physical access to the landscape for a
   variety of publics is becoming ever more important. Where a multitude of
   actors are involved in landscape management, diverging subjective and
   collective perceptions of these changing landscapes, hold potential for
   disagreement about suitable adaptive measures. Although the body of
   literature on the role of subjective values in processes of climate
   adaptation is growing the societal constructions of respective places
   and landscapes underlying different adaptation approaches remain
   under-researched. We show in this paper that how landscapes are
   understood by actors in environmental management matters for
   decision-making. In particular, differentunclerstandings of the Cornish
   landscape at Godrevy Headland are shown to have material implications
   for how issues of access, visitor management and long-term responses to
   climate change and coastal erosion are addressed. In the case of
   Godrevy, coastal erosion has required local actors to plan the
   relocation of a visitor car park, bringing contrasting perspectives on
   the landscape, its use and protection to the fore. Uncovering the
   individual and collective assumptions about the landscape behind these
   conflicting narratives, is vital for fostering inclusive policy and
   planning processes around climate change adaptation.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses significant challenges to coastal cities. Local
   governments around the world are using various strategies to address sea
   level rise and coastal flooding. Most of these responses are reactive,
   developed in an ad hoc manner following a specific event, but there is
   an increasing recognition of the need for more comprehensive and
   proactive approaches. Research into the topic reflects practice, with
   numerous studies of particular locations or strategies providing
   information in a piecemeal manner lacking in comprehensive evaluations.
   This paper addresses this gap through a systematic literature review
   that identifies coastal flooding and sea level rise adaptation practices
   and evaluates their comparative advantages and disadvantages. The
   findings identify a major knowledge gap in comparative costs and
   benefits of alternative adaptation strategies and indicate that coastal
   climate adaptation needs to be tailored to local characteristics and use
   a combination of different structural and non-structural measures to be
   effective.},

Title = {LOCAL DIFFERENTIATION AND ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN COASTAL GHANA},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW},
Abstract = {This study investigates the perception of the impact of climate change
   on the livelihoods of small-scale fishing communities in the Western
   Region of Ghana. A mixed-method approach was employed, consisting of a
   survey of 400 fisherfolk households and 20 interviews with stakeholders.
   Changes in rainfall pattern, decreasing rainfall, stronger waves and
   storms that increase coastal erosion and cause persistent flooding were
   found to be the main effects of climate change on the livelihoods of
   small-scale coastal fisherfolk. Transnational fishing practices by
   fisherfolk in response to climate change contributed to the building of
   resilience of fishing households, while other adaptation strategies
   appeared to be insufficient in the long run. Coastal communities are not
   homogenous with respect to climate change impacts and corresponding
   adaptation strategies. Based on the empirical results, policy
   implications are suggested related to early warning systems and
   multiscalar marine planning.},

Abstract = {Designing conservation strategies in human-dominated landscapes is
   challenging, owing to complex human-natural systems and evolving
   societal values. To meet this challenge, a robust, adaptive strategy
   should have a process for flexible implementation of incremental
   actions. We describe a hypothetical example for the Rio Grande de
   Arecibo watershed and coastal wetlands in Puerto Rico to address the
   first component. The process begins by identifying shared stakeholder
   objectives. This process benefits from a review of foundational research
   and knowledge base that includes global forcings and vulnerability of
   resources of interest. Forcings include climate change and pervasive
   urban sprawl. We focus on two taxonomic groups with differing life
   histories but strong dependence on water resource dynamics, another
   resource valued by humans. We stipulate objectives and multiple actions,
   but focus on those pertaining to hydro-management as the common thread
   in our example. We advanced two decision contexts of contrasting
   complexity, illustrated links between objectives and actions, and
   highlighted trade-offs triggered by varying resource valuation. Our
   focus was to highlight various components necessary to frame a
   resilience-based strategy, but we cannot overemphasize the importance of
   accommodating institutional and stakeholder changing priorities and
   values to ensure its successful implementation.},

Title = {Increasing risk over time of weather-related hazards to the European
   population: a data-driven prognostic study},
Journal = {LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {1},
Number = {5},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background The observed increase in the effects on human beings of
   weather-related disasters has been largely attributed to the rise in
   population exposed, with a possible influence of global warming. Yet,
   future risks of weather-related hazards on human lives in view of
   climate and demographic changes have not been comprehensively
   investigated.
   Methods We assessed the risk of weather-related hazards to the European
   population in terms of annual numbers of deaths in 30 year intervals
   relative to the reference period (1981-2010) up to the year 2100
   (2011-40, 2041-70, and 2071-100) by combining disaster records with
   high-resolution hazard and demographic projections in a prognostic
   modelling framework. We focused on the hazards with the greatest
   impacts-heatwaves and cold waves, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal
   floods, and windstorms-and evaluated their spatial and temporal
   variations in intensity and frequency under a business-as-usual scenario
   of greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled long-term demographic dynamics
   through a territorial modelling platform to represent the evolution of
   human exposure under a corresponding middle-of-the-road socioeconomic
   scenario. We appraised human vulnerability to weather extremes on the
   basis of more than 2300 records collected from disaster databases during
   the reference period and assumed it to be static under a scenario of no
   adaptation.
   Findings We found that weather-related disasters could affect about
   two-thirds of the European population annually by the year 2100 (351
   million people exposed per year {[}uncertainty range 126 million to 523
   million] during the period 2071-100) compared with 5\% during the
   reference period (1981-2010; 25 million people exposed per year). About
   50 times the number of fatalities occurring annually during the
   reference period (3000 deaths) could occur by the year 2100 (152 000
   deaths {[}80 500-239 800]). Future effects show a prominent latitudinal
   gradient, increasing towards southern Europe, where the premature
   mortality rate due to weather extremes (about 700 annual fatalities per
   million inhabitants {[}482-957] during the period 2071-100 vs 11 during
   the reference period) could become the greatest environmental risk
   factor. The projected changes are dominated by global warming
   (accounting for more than 90\% of the rise in risk to human beings),
   mainly through a rise in the frequency of heatwaves (about 2700
   heat-related fatalities per year during the reference period vs 151 500
   {[}80 100-239 000] during the period 2071-100).
   Interpretation Global warming could result in rapidly rising costs of
   weather-related hazards to human beings in Europe unless adequate
   adaptation measures are taken. Our results could aid in prioritisation
   of regional investments to address the unequal burden of effects on
   human beings of weather-related hazards and differences in adaptation
   capacities. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Embedding the value of coastal ecosystem services into climate change
   adaptation planning},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Coastal habitats, such as salt marshes and dune systems, can protect
   communities from hazards by reducing coastline exposure. However, these
   critical habitats and their diverse ecosystem services are threatened by
   coastal development and the impacts from a changing climate. Ever
   increasing pressure on coastal habitats calls for coastal climate
   adaptation efforts that mitigate or adapt to these pressures in ways
   that maintain the integrity of coastal landscapes. An important
   challenge for decisionmakers is determining the best mitigation and
   adaptation strategies that not only protect human lives and property,
   but also safeguard the ability of coastal habitats to provide a broad
   suite of benefits. Here, we present a potential pathway for local-scale
   climate change adaptation planning through the identification and
   mapping of natural habitats that provide the greatest benefits to
   coastal communities. The methodology coupled a coastal vulnerability
   model with a climate adaptation policy assessment in an effort to
   identify priority locations for nature-based solutions that reduce
   vulnerability of critical assets using feasible land-use policy methods.
   Our results demonstrate the critical role of natural habitats in
   providing the ecosystem service of coastal protection in California. We
   found that specific dune habitats play a key role in reducing erosion
   and inundation of the coastline and that several wetland areas help to
   absorb energy from storms and provide a protective service for the coast
   of Marin county, California, USA. Climate change and adaptation planning
   are globally relevant issues in which the scalability and
   transferability of solutions must be considered. This work outlines an
   iterative approach for climate adaptation planning at a local-scale,
   with opportunity to consider the scalability of an iterative
   science-policy engagement approach to regional, national, and
   international levels.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Surprises commonly occur in natural resource systems and are manifest as
   dramatic shifts in ecosystem structure and processes. Southern Florida
   ecosystems have had two such surprises in the last two decades, (1)
   changes in dominant plant species in freshwater marshes of the
   Everglades; and (2) massive die-offs of seagrass in Florida Bay. Both
   examples indicate a loss of ecological resilience and subsequent shifts
   in controlling processes or stability domains. Techniques of adaptive
   environmental assessment and management that confront alternative
   hypotheses of ecosystem change and propose management actions that allow
   managers to learn have provided robust responses to these surprises. Two
   predicates for adaptive management are sufficient resilience in the
   ecosystem components of a resource system and flexibility in the social
   system. Ecological resilience provides a buffer in the ecosystem to the
   inevitable failure of management actions. Social flexibility through
   trust and cooperation is needed if ecosystem resilience is exceeded. (C)

Abstract = {Low elevation coastal zones (LECZ) are extensive throughout the
   southeastern United States. LECZ communities are threatened by
   inundation from sea level rise, storm surge, wetland degradation, land
   subsidence, and hydrological flooding. Communication among scientists,
   stakeholders, policy makers and minority and poor residents must
   improve. We must predict processes spanning the ecological, physical,
   social, and health sciences. Communities need to address linkages of (1)
   human and socioeconomic vulnerabilities; (2) public health and safety;
   (3) economic concerns; (4) land loss; (5) wetland threats; and (6)
   coastal inundation. Essential capabilities must include a network to
   assemble and distribute data and model code to assess risk and its
   causes, support adaptive management, and improve the resiliency of
   communities. Better communication of information and understanding among
   residents and officials is essential. Here we review recent background
   literature on these matters and offer recommendations for integrating
   natural and social sciences. We advocate for a cyber-network of
   scientists, modelers, engineers, educators, and stakeholders from
   academia, federal state and local agencies, non-governmental
   organizations, residents, and the private sector. Our vision is to
   enhance future resilience of LECZ communities by offering approaches to
   mitigate hazards to human health, safety and welfare and reduce impacts
   to coastal residents and industries.},

Abstract = {Forest landowners can adapt to climate change and carbon pricing by
   altering the types of forests that are replanted or regenerated. By
   inducing land-use changes within forestry, climate adaptation and
   mitigation policy can alter the flow of nonmarket forest ecosystem
   services. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the effect of climate
   change and carbon pricing on adaptation behavior of private forest
   owners. We develop an empirical framework with application to the US
   Pacific coast. An estimated discrete-choice econometric model is used as
   the empirical basis for a simulation of land-use changes to the
   composition of a landscape's forest stock. Results indicate that climate
   change induces landowners to adapt away from their current dominant
   species choice of Douglas-fir to species more suitable for the future
   climate, notably hardwoods and ponderosa pine. A carbon price policy
   accelerates adaptation away from current forest types, potentially
   creating an externality at the local level.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise due the climate change has emerged the coastal flood
   phenomena in North Jakarta. Coastal flood gives a negative impact on the
   environment and socio-economic life of the Marunda community, forcing
   the communities to be locally adapted towards the disaster. Community
   Local adaptation defined as an effort to reduce the risk of flooding
   based on their behavioral and cultural actions. The purpose of this
   study was to identify the community local adaptation strategies in
   confronting the coastal flooding based on the socio-economic and
   environmental perspectives in Marunda, North Jakarta, Indonesia. This
   study uses a narrative review analysis from indepth interviews,
   observations, and literature studies. Data analysis includes the stage
   of action diagnosis and action evaluation. Based on the results, the
   local adaptation strategy in Marunda community are classified into three
   phases, namely at the step before, after, and during a flood. These
   three stages contain elements of physical and social adaptation derived
   from the ability of the community to remember experiences, learning from
   experience, and sharing experiences with individuals and other groups.
   These three abilities help the community to take adaptation actions so
   that the Marunda community becomes resilient to coastal flood.},

Title = {Adapting adaptation: the English eco-town initiative as governance
   process},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation and mitigation have become key policy drivers
   in the UK under its Climate Change Act of 2008. At the same time,
   urbanization has been high on the agenda, given the pressing need for
   substantial additional housing, particularly in southeast England. These
   twin policy objectives were brought together in the UK government's
   `eco-town' initiative for England launched in 2007, which has since
   resulted in four eco-town projects currently under development. We
   critically analyze the eco-town initiative's policy evolution and early
   planning phase from a multilevel governance perspective by focusing on
   the following two interrelated aspects: (1) the evolving governance
   structures and resulting dynamics arising from the development of the
   eco-town initiative at UK governmental level, and the subsequent partial
   devolution to local stakeholders, including local authorities and
   nongovernmental actors, under the new `localism' agenda; and (2) the
   effect of these governance dynamics on the conceptual and practical
   approach to adaptation through the emerging eco-town projects. As such,
   we problematize the impact of multilevel governance relations, and
   competing governance strategies and leadership, on shaping eco-town and
   related adaptation strategies and practice.},

Abstract = {Determining the emergent climate change signals in the tropical
   Pacific-mean state and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-is crucial
   for climate action. Model simulations show that the mean sea surface
   temperature signal is already detectable, and that mean rainfall and
   ENSO-related signals could emerge around 2040.
   Future changes in the mean climate of the tropical Pacific and
   characteristics of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
   established as being likely. Determining the time of emergence of
   climate change signals from the natural variability is critical for
   mitigation strategies and adaptation planning. Here, using a multimodel
   ensemble, we find that the annual-mean sea surface temperature (SST)
   signal has already emerged across much of the tropical Pacific,
   appearing last in the east. The signal of a wetter annual-mean rainfall
   in the east is expected to emerge by mid-century, with some sensitivity
   to emission scenario. However, the ENSO-related rainfall variability
   signal is projected to emerge by about 2040 regardless of emission
   scenario, about 30 years earlier than ENSO-related SST variability
   signal at about 2070. Our results are instructive for the detection of
   climate change signals and reinforce the rapidly emerging risks of
   ENSO-induced climate extremes regardless of mitigation actions.},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {711-728},
Abstract = {Deltas and coastal cities around the world face the need to adapt to
   uncertain future changes. We compared adaptation planning on flood risk
   management in four cases based on three main elements of adaptive
   planning: to prepare for a wide range of plausible future scenarios; to
   respond to change with robust and flexible actions; and to monitor
   critical changes to be able to reassess the plan accordingly.
   Differences can be observed in the implementation of these elements.
   Good practices could be distinguished: cases consider a wide range of
   future scenarios; short-term decisions are coupled with long-term
   options while envisioning these options and possibilities for switching
   between them through adaptation pathways; opportunities originating from
   other agendas to achieve multiple objective investments are seized; and
   the system's resilience is improved by a wide variety of measures. At
   the same time some barriers for using adaptive planning approaches were
   identified: the use of a wide range of scenarios is only accepted in an
   exploratory phase of planning. Structural flood protection measures
   taken in the past do constrain future choices. The potential for
   monitoring and reassessment of options is hampered by the fact that
   trends in some variables cannot be detected.},

Abstract = {Climate change in the twenty-first century will strongly affect the
   processes that define natural and human systems. The Washington Climate
   Change Impacts Assessment (WACCIA) was intended to identify the nature
   and effects of climate change on natural and human resources in
   Washington State over the next century. The assessment focused on eight
   sectors that were identified as being potentially most climate
   sensitive: agriculture, energy, salmon, urban stormwater infrastructure,
   forests, human health, coasts, and water resources. Most of these
   sectors are sensitive in one way or another to water availability. While
   water is generally abundant in the state under current climate
   conditions, its availability is highly variable in space and time, and
   these variations are expected to change as the climate warms. Here we
   summarize the results of the WACCIA and identify uncertainties and
   common mechanisms that relate many of the impacts. We also address
   cross-sectoral sensitivities, vulnerabilities, and adaptation
   strategies.},

Title = {Rapid vulnerability assessment of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax)
   fisheries facing climate change in Mexico},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Pacific sardine fishery is the most important in terms of catch
   volume in Mexico. Due to their trophic position, small pelagic fishes
   respond rapidly and abruptly to ocean climate variability at interannual
   (ENSO) and decadal time scales (PDO), which is why their response to
   climate change is expected. The present study applied the Rapid
   Vulnerability Assessment (RVA) designed for Natural Protected Areas to
   the context of sardine fishery in northwestern Mexico, expecting that
   the vulnerability of the fishery to climate change will be the same in
   the two main fishing areas. The results demonstrate that the RVA is a
   useful and lissome method, integrating all stakeholders knowledge,
   including the academic perspective, and serves as an adaptive strategic
   planning tool upon climate change. Also, because of its dynamics, it was
   shown to promote co management practices due to the collaborative
   consensus reached. The sardine fishery from the Gulf of California was
   considered as the most vulnerable to climate change due to the potential
   exchange of tropical species of lower commercial value; while
   environmental changes are expected to favor such fishery in the Pacific
   along Baja California peninsula. We recommend working on adaptation
   measures to lower the risk presented by overfishing, and address efforts
   towards the certification of the fishery in the Pacific region.},

Abstract = {Climate change causes environment change and shows up on land covers.
   Through observing the change of land use, researchers can find out the
   trend and potential mechanism of the land cover change. Effective
   adaptation policies can affect pattern of land cover change and may
   decrease the risks of climate change impacts. By simulating land use
   dynamics with scenario settings, this paper attempts to explore the
   relationship between climate change and land-cover change through
   efficient adaptation polices. It involves spatial statistical model in
   estimating possibility of land-cover change, cellular automata model in
   modeling land-cover dynamics, and scenario analysis in response to
   adaptation polices. The results show that, without any control, the
   critical eco-areas, such as estuarine areas, will be destroyed and
   people may move to the vulnerable and important economic development
   areas. In the other hand, under the limited development condition for
   adaptation, people migration to peri-urban and critical eco-areas may be

Abstract = {Globally, collapse of ecosystems-potentially irreversible change to
   ecosystem structure, composition and function-imperils biodiversity,
   human health and well-being. We examine the current state and recent
   trajectories of 19 ecosystems, spanning 58 degrees of latitude across
   7.7 M km(2), from Australia's coral reefs to terrestrial Antarctica.
   Pressures from global climate change and regional human impacts,
   occurring as chronic `presses' and/or acute `pulses', drive ecosystem
   collapse. Ecosystem responses to 5-17 pressures were categorised as four
   collapse profiles-abrupt, smooth, stepped and fluctuating. The
   manifestation of widespread ecosystem collapse is a stark warning of the
   necessity to take action. We present a three-step assessment and
   management framework (3As Pathway Awareness, Anticipation and Action) to
   aid strategic and effective mitigation to alleviate further degradation
   to help secure our future.},

Abstract = {Pakistan is home to a wide range of geographical landscapes, each of
   which faces different climate change impacts and challenges. This
   article presents findings from a National Geographic Society funded
   project, which employed a people-centered, narratives-based approach to
   study climate impacts and adaptation strategies of people in 19 rural
   study sites in four provinces of Pakistan (N = 108). The study looked at
   six climate-related stressors-changes in weather patterns, floods,
   Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, drought, heat waves, and sea-level rise-in
   the coastal areas of Sindh, the desert of Thar, the plains of Punjab,
   and the mountains of Hunza, Gilgit, and Chitral. Speaking to people at
   these frontlines of climate change revealed much about climate suffering
   and trauma. Not only is the suffering induced by losses and damages to
   property and livelihood, but climate impacts also take a heavy toll on
   people's psycho-social wellbeing, particularly when they are displaced
   from their homes. The findings further demonstrate that people try to
   adapt in various ways, for instance by altering their agricultural
   practices, but they face severe barriers to effective adaptation action.
   Understanding people's perceptions of climate change and incorporating
   their recommendations in adaptation planning can help policy-makers
   develop a more participatory, inclusive, and holistic climate resilience
   framework for the future.},

Abstract = {Many developing countries are already affected by multiple stressors,
   which have increased their vulnerability to accelerated negative
   environmental change. Coastal erosion, deforestation and habitat
   fragmentation become even more serious problems in coastal locations
   when coupled with the projected impacts of climate change. However,
   anticipatory adaptation to such changes as increased coastal erosion and
   extreme events does not need to wait for specific climate scenarios, but
   is more reliant on the examination of current vulnerabilities and the
   range of possible no-regret strategies. These need to, however,
   accommodate multiple stakeholder preferences. This study therefore
   examines coastal communities' perceptions of environmental change in
   northeast Zanzibar, Tanzania and their preferences for adaptive
   strategies, while simultaneously examining physical change processes
   through change analysis. The study suggests coastal forest buffer zones
   as an anticipatory adaptation measure, which is based on soft measures
   such as vegetation planting, awareness raising and stakeholder
   cooperation.},

Title = {The rise of resilience: Evolution of a new concept in coastal planning
   in Ireland and the US},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Number = {A},
Pages = {19-31},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Interest in the concept of resilience has grown significantly in recent
   years. The perceived strengths of resilience as a concept stem from its
   foundations in the sciences and humanities, and have recently gained
   currency amongst political actors and in policy spheres. This papers
   objective is to investigate the value of resilience as a concept when
   applied to the process of coastal climate change adaptation with a focus
   on place specificity. As applied to coastal hazards and climate change
   adaptation, we expect that resilience encompasses more system
   complexities than a traditional vulnerability or hazards approach. Our
   aim in this paper is achieved through carrying out a critical analysis
   of Irish and US academic and policy literature and determining if, and
   to what degree, one or more of the three selected lenses of
   psychological, engineering and ecological resilience are applied.
   Through contrasting the evolution of coastal adaptation policy
   developments in both Ireland and the U.S. the paper highlights the
   importance of policy, environment and geography in the area of coastal
   management. It furthermore examines the question of whether the concept
   of resilience represents a paradigm shift, or whether it maintains the
   dominant anthropological perspective of earlier hazard mitigation
   approaches under new guise.
   The increasing focus on climate adaptation as more than enhanced hazard
   mitigation exemplifies that shift. In the U.S. proposals for large-scale
   retreat programs post-Sandy are further evidence that combined
   ecological-anthropological approaches are gaining traction, though
   planning actions taken and factors considered continue to be dominated
   by parochialism and anthropocentric or psychological definitions of
   resilience. In Ireland there is a noticeable increase in the ecological
   resilience grounded practices of adaptive management and co-management
   in relation to coastal planning. The fostering of Integrated Coastal
   Zone Management (ICZM) frameworks as well as a clear linking between
   climate adaption and the management of coastal regions underlines this
   development. Results indicate that resilience, under the three forms
   explored, is a concept that has recently increased in popularity.
   Simultaneously, there has been a discernible shift in the direction of
   broader inclusion of concerns about human environment interactions, but
   the two are not necessarily coextensive, and concepts of resilience do
   not always encompass these concerns. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {2019},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Vast mosaics of lakes, wetlands, and rivers on the Arctic Coastal Plain
   give the impression of water surplus. Yet long winters lock freshwater
   resources in ice, limiting freshwater habitats and water supply for
   human uses. Increasingly the petroleum industry relies on lakes to build
   temporary ice roads for winter oil exploration. Permitting water
   withdrawal for ice roads in Arctic Alaska is dependent on lake depth,
   ice thickness, and the fish species present. Recent winter warming
   suggests that more winter water will be available for ice-road
   construction, yet high interannual variability in ice thickness and
   summer precipitation complicates habitat impact assessments. To address
   these concerns, multidisciplinary researchers are working to understand
   how Arctic freshwater habitats are responding to changes in both climate
   and water use in northern Alaska. The dynamics of habitat availability
   and connectivity are being linked to how food webs support fish and
   waterbirds across diverse freshwater habitats. Moving toward
   watershed-scale habitat classification coupled with scenario analysis of
   climate extremes and water withdrawal is increasingly relevant to future
   resource management decisions in this region. Such progressive
   refinement in understanding responses to change provides an example of
   adaptive management focused on ensuring responsible resource development
   in the Arctic.},

Title = {Urban Growth and Heat in Tropical Climates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {This research describes the change in temperatures across approximately
   270 tropical cities from 1960 to 2020 with a focus on urban warming. It
   associates urban growth indicators with temperature variations in
   tropical climate zones (tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, and
   tropical wet-dry savanna). Our findings demonstrate that over time while
   temperatures have increased across the tropics, urban residents have
   experienced higher temperatures (minimum and maximum) than those living
   outside of cities. Moreover, in certain tropical zones, over the study
   period, temperatures have risen faster in urban areas than the
   background (non-urban) temperatures. The results also suggest that with
   continuing climate change and urban growth, temperatures will continue
   to rise at higher than background levels in tropical cities unless
   mitigation measures are implemented. Several fundamental characteristics
   of urban growth including population size, population density,
   infrastructure and urban land use patterns are factors associated with
   variations in temperatures. We find evidence that dense urban forms
   (compact residential and industrial developments) are associated with
   higher temperatures and population density is a better predictor of
   variation in temperatures than either urban population size or
   infrastructure in most tropic climate zones. Infrastructure, however, is
   a better predictor of temperature increases in wet-dry savanna tropical
   climates than population density. There are a number of potential
   mitigation measures available to urban managers to address heat. We
   focus on ecological services, but whether these services can address the
   projected increasing heat levels is unclear. More local research is
   necessary to untangle the various contributions to increasing heat in
   cities and evaluate whether these applications can be effective to cool
   tropical cities as temperature continue to rise. Our methods include
   combining several different datasets to identify differences in daily,
   seasonal, and annual maximum and minimum temperatures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {682-696},
Abstract = {Megacities in low- and middle-income countries face unique threats from
   climate change as vulnerable populations and infrastructure are
   concentrated in high-risk areas. This paper develops a theoretical
   framework to characterize adaptation readiness in Global South cities
   and applies the framework to Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city with acute
   exposure and projected impacts from flooding and extreme heat. To gather
   case evidence from Dhaka we draw upon interviews with national and
   municipal government officials and a review of planning documents and
   peer-reviewed literature. We find: (1) national-level plans propose a
   number of adaptation strategies, but urban concerns compete with
   priorities such as protection of coastal assets and agricultural
   production; (2) municipal plans focus on identifying vulnerability and
   impacts rather than adaptation strategies; (3) interviewees suggest that
   lack of coordination among local government (LG) organizations and lack
   of transparency act as barriers for municipal adaptation planning, with
   national plans driving policy where LGs have limited human and financial
   resources; and (4) we found limited evidence that national urban
   adaptation directives trickle down to municipal government. The
   framework developed offers a systematic and standardized means to assess
   and monitor the status of adaptation planning in Global South cities,
   and identify adaptation constraints and opportunities.},

Abstract = {The increasing vulnerability of coastal areas to climate change and
   coastal Risks, is now clearly established due to sea level rise. These
   events, which have become commonplace, constitute a danger for residents
   and for public facilities, roads, homes, etc. and make these areas more
   and more vulnerable. Although measures to reduce this vulnerability of
   coastal cities have been identified by experts and authorities, a
   resistance exists to their implementation by the inhabitants of these
   areas exposed to coastal risks. The aim of our study is to investigate
   risk perception and coping strategies used by inhabitants of areas at
   risk of coastal flooding and coastal erosion, and to identify potential
   differences between these two types of coastal risks. More precisely,
   this study seeks to identify the major predictors of the willingness to
   cope using Bayesian regression. 208 inhabitants of coastal areas exposed
   at risk of coastal flooding and erosion in Pays de la Loire, region of
   western France, participated to our study. Results reveal that coastal
   erosion is perceived as a greater threat, essentially because it is
   perceived as more frightening than coastal flooding. Moreover, our
   results showed that past experiences of coastal risks had an impact on
   the willingness to use active coping strategies and that there were
   major differences in the choice of strategy depending on the risks.
   These results are discussed in terms of risk management.},

Title = {A systematic review on Asian's farmers' adaptation practices towards
   climate change},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {644},
Pages = {683-695},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Climate change in Asia is affecting farmers' daily routines. Much of the
   focus surrounding climate change has targeted the economic and
   environmental repercussions on farming. Few systematic reviews have been
   carried out on the social impacts of climate change among farmers in
   Asia. The present article set out to analyse the existing literature on
   Asian farmers' adaptation practices towards the impacts of climate
   change. Guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) review method, a systematic review
   of the Scopus and Web of Science databases identified 38 related
   studies. Further review of these articles resulted in six main themes
   crop management, irrigation and water management, farm management,
   financial management, physical infrastructure management and social
   activities. These six themes further produced a total of 35 sub-themes.
   Several recommendations are highlighted related to conducting more
   qualitative studies, to have specific and a standard systematic review
   method for guide research synthesis in context of climate change
   adaptation and to practice complimentary searching techniques such as
   citation tracking, reference searching, snowballing and contacting
   experts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Drivers of vulnerability to climate change and adaptive responses of
   forest-edge farming households in major agro-ecological zones of Nigeria},
Journal = {GEOJOURNAL},
Abstract = {An understanding of forest communities' risk factors for climate
   variation, adaptation trajectories, and how agroecological differences
   shape their responses are critical to future policy formulation in
   Nigeria. Therefore, drivers of vulnerability to climate change and
   adaptation options of forest communities' farming households in major
   agro-ecological zones of Nigeria were investigated. Data were collected,
   using an interview schedule, from 183 forest-edge households in savanna,
   mangrove, and rainforest agro-ecologies. Descriptive statistics and
   analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. Respondents
   cultivated 6.4 +/- 2.6 acres of farmland. Changes in rainfall patterns
   were most experienced in the rainforest and savanna whereas, it was
   temperature fluctuation in the mangrove. Crop farming was the worst hit
   by climate change among other livelihoods. Crop rotation in the savanna
   and mangrove ((x) over bar =2.12; 2.44, respectively) and mixed farming
   in the rainforest ( (x) over bar = 2.52) were top adaptation priorities
   while crop insurance was the least. Low paying livelihood alternatives (
   (x) over bar = 1.54), illiteracy ( (x) over bar = 1.73), and lack of
   infrastructure ( (x) over bar = 1.38) were major social vulnerability
   drivers of climate change in the savanna, mangrove, and rainforest,
   respectively. Major political and economic drivers were inconsistent
   government policy and poverty, respectively. The use of adaptation
   measures was not significantly different in the agro-ecologies, whereas,
   the livelihood impact of climate change was (F = 9.990; p < 0.05).
   Social and environmental drivers of vulnerability to climate change
   differ in the forest communities, and adaptation priorities varied
   according to zones.},

Title = {Sex differences in oxidative stress responses of tropical topshells

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},

Volume = {131},
Number = {A},

Abstract = {Given scarcity of knowledge on gender ecophysiological responses of
   tropical marine organisms to global climate change, the major aim of
   this research was to investigate potential sex differences in oxidative
   status of topshell Trochus histrio, after a combined exposure to
   increased temperature and pCO(2). Lipid peroxidation, heat-shock
   response and antioxidant enzymatic activities were evaluated. Lipid
   peroxidation varied differently between sexes, with males undergoing
   cellular damage under high pCO(2), which was elevated
   temperature-counteracted. Heat shock response was thermo- and
   sex-regulated, with males exhibiting significantly higher heat shock
   proteins production than females. Catalase activity increased with
   temperature and was exacerbated in combination with hypercapnia, being
   highest in females, while glutathione S-transferases activity peaked in
   males. These results clearly support the existence of distinct
   physiological strategies to cope oxidative stress between sexes,
   apparently more efficient in females, and also reinforce for the need of
   encompassing sex as meaningful variable in future biomarker studies.},

Title = {Hotels in contexts of uncertainty: Measuring organisational resilience},
Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The tourism industry faces multiple changes (economic crises, climate
   change, technology innovation...). Because of this vulnerability, as
   evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study of hotel resilience is a
   key issue for the survival and competitiveness of organisations and
   destinations. Therefore, this paper proposes a holistic model to measure
   organisational resilience. To that end, it aims to analyse the
   determinants of organisational resilience, i.e. predictors of resilience
   (strategy and change), and to assess how they contribute to hotel
   resilience and performance. Firstly, the hotel context in the Canary
   Islands is examined to identify the level of impact, frequency and
   predictability of each type of change. Secondly, scales development and
   validation were conducted. Finally, the proposed model is validated.
   Findings confirm that the strategy and change dimensions have a
   considerable effect on hotel resilience, which positively influences
   hotel performance. Discussion provides hotel managers with guidelines to
   improve organisational resilience and performance.},

Title = {A Framework for Responding to Coral Disease Outbreaks that Facilitates
   Adaptive Management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Predicted increases in coral disease outbreaks associated with climate
   change have implications for coral reef ecosystems and the people and
   industries that depend on them. It is critical that coral reef managers
   understand these implications and have the ability to assess and reduce
   risk, detect and contain outbreaks, and monitor and minimise impacts.
   Here, we present a coral disease response framework that has four core
   components: (1) an early warning system, (2) a tiered impact assessment
   program, (3) scaled management actions and (4) a communication plan. The
   early warning system combines predictive tools that monitor the risk of
   outbreaks of temperature-dependent coral diseases with in situ
   observations provided by a network of observers who regularly report on
   coral health and reef state. Verified reports of an increase in disease
   prevalence trigger a tiered response of more detailed impact assessment,
   targeted research and/or management actions. The response is scaled to
   the risk posed by the outbreak, which is a function of the severity and
   spatial extent of the impacts. We review potential management actions to
   mitigate coral disease impacts and facilitate recovery, considering
   emerging strategies unique to coral disease and more established
   strategies to support reef resilience. We also describe approaches to
   communicating about coral disease outbreaks that will address common
   misperceptions and raise awareness of the coral disease threat. By
   adopting this framework, managers and researchers can establish a
   community of practice and can develop response plans for the management
   of coral disease outbreaks based on local needs. The collaborations
   between managers and researchers we suggest will enable adaptive
   management of disease impacts following evaluating the
   cost-effectiveness of emerging response actions and incrementally
   improving our understanding of outbreak causation.},

Abstract = {Environmental variability is an intrinsic characteristic of nature.
   Variability in factors such as temperature, UV, salinity, and nutrient
   availability can influence structural and functional properties of
   marine microbial organisms. This influence has profound implications for
   biochemical cycles and the ecosystem services provided by the oceans. In
   this review we discuss some of the most relevant mechanisms underpinning
   adaptive strategies of microbial organisms in variable and dynamic
   oceans. We assess the extent to which the magnitude and rate of
   environmental change influence plastic phenotypic adjustments and
   evolutionary trajectories of microbial populations. This understanding
   is fundamental for developing better predictions regarding microbial
   dynamics at ecological and evolutionary time-scales and in response to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Pacific island countries are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate
   change, given their unique geography and natural-resource dependent
   economies. This paper reviews the potential impacts of climate change
   over the coming decades in the Pacific island-economies to identify
   measures for minimizing or mitigating these impacts. Drawing on the
   downscaling results of Global Climate Models (GCMs), the paper
   summarizes climate change effects such as changes in temperature,
   rainfall patterns, and sea levels. Assessment of GCMs suggests that sea
   level increases are likely to be substantially higher than previously
   accepted estimates, posing risks of inundation and salinization of
   freshwater in the Pacific island countries. Crop growth models suggest
   the potential for substantial losses of agricultural yields, while
   fisheries models predict changes to catches, and other modeling efforts
   identify substantial consequences for health and tourism. Integrated
   Assessment Models indicate the substantial total economic losses, if the
   business-as-usual growth strategy is followed. Appropriate adaptation
   strategies must be implemented, in order to ensure that poverty
   eradication and sustainable development are not impeded.},

Title = {Rethinking Sea-Level Projections Using Families and Timing Differences},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the recent decade, many global and regional sea-level rise (SLR)
   projections have been published, which raises questions for users. Here,
   we present a series of strategies to help users to see the forest for
   the trees, by reducing the number of choices to be made. First, we use
   the similarities in the methodologies and contributing sources of the
   projections to group 82 projections from 29 publications into only 8
   families. Second, we focus on the timing of reaching several global mean
   SLR thresholds, and the uncertainty therein, rather than the projected
   value in the year 2100. Finally, we combine the information on timing
   and families to define three categories which can support decision
   making. For global mean SLR up to 0.50 m the differences in timing are
   small, regardless of climate scenario or family, clearly indicating a
   timing window for adaptation decisions. For larger global mean SLR
   (0.75-1.00 m), the climate scenario becomes more important for the
   uncertainties in timing, but the SLR threshold will be crossed within a
   limited window of time, supporting adaptation decision making on the
   medium to long term. Beyond 1.00 m the differences between the families
   and climate scenario strongly determine the uncertainties in timing, and
   more information is needed, for instance using early warning signals,
   before decisions for adaptation can be made. We make recommendations on
   how each of these three categories, combined with the lead time and
   lifespan of adaptation options, can inform decisions on adaptation
   strategies using adaptation pathways planning.},

Abstract = {Information on sustainability can be used for future development
   planning. This study presents an approach for assessing urban
   sustainability. Delphi and fuzzy logic methods and the Kruskal-Wallis
   test were the discovery and verification techniques used. The city
   system comprised social, economic, and environmental subsystems. The
   seven orientors of existence, effectiveness, freedom of action,
   security, adaptability, coexistence, and psychological need were
   measured using different indicators. The final sustainability output was
   obtained by aggregation of the multiple orientors and subsystems
   sustainability values into a unified measure. A fuzzy sustainability
   index was developed to compare the importance of the sustainability
   orientors and subsystems. The model was applied to Mahshahr, an
   industrialized coastal city in Iran. The model output for the subsystems
   showed significant differences between the economic and environmental
   subsystems and the social subsystem. The final sustainability output
   showed that the effectiveness orientor gave the highest sustainability
   value. The model is dynamic and can be modified for different purposes
   by changing the indicators. With this model, policy-makers can evaluate
   existing city sustainability and predict future sustainability by
   varying the indicators. This can be done on local, regional, and global
   scales for security and adaptation strategies, mitigation plans, and
   sustainable development management.},

Title = {Predicting the population-level impact of mitigating harbor porpoise
   bycatch with pingers and time-area fishing closures},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Unintentional mortality of higher trophic-level species in commercial
   fisheries (bycatch) represents a major conservation concern as it may
   influence the long-term persistence of populations. An increasingly
   common strategy to mitigate bycatch of harbor porpoises (Phocoena
   phocoena), a small and protected marine top predator, involves the use
   of pingers (acoustic alarms that emit underwater noise) and time-area
   fishing closures. Although these mitigation measures can reduce harbor
   porpoise bycatch in gillnet fisheries considerably, inference about the
   long-term population-level consequences is currently lacking. We
   developed a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model (IBM)
   with the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these two bycatch
   mitigation measures. We quantified both the direct positive effects
   (i.e., reduced bycatch) and any indirect negative effects (i.e., reduced
   foraging efficiency) on the population size using the inner Danish
   waters as a biological system. The model incorporated empirical data on
   gillnet fishing effort and noise avoidance behavior by free-ranging
   harbor porpoises exposed to randomized high-frequency (20- to 160-kHz)
   pinger signals. The IBM simulations revealed a synergistic relationship
   between the implementation of time-area fishing closures and pinger
   deployment. Time-area fishing closures reduced bycatch rates
   substantially but not completely. In contrast, widespread pinger
   deployment resulted in total mitigation of bycatch but frequent and
   recurrent noise avoidance behavior in high-quality foraging habitat
   negatively affected individual survival and the total population size.
   When both bycatch mitigation measures were implemented simultaneously,
   the negative impact of pinger noise-induced sub-lethal behavioral
   effects on the population was largely eliminated with a positive effect
   on the population size that was larger than when the mitigation measures
   were used independently. Our study highlights that conservationists and
   policy makers need to consider and balance both the direct and indirect
   effects of harbor porpoise bycatch mitigation measures before enforcing
   their widespread implementation. Individual-based simulation models,
   such as the one presented here, offer an efficient and dynamic framework
   to evaluate the impact of human activities on the long-term survival of
   marine populations and can serve as a basis to design adaptive
   management strategies that satisfy both ecological and socioeconomic
   demands on marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Human pressure has changed the physical and ecological characteristics
   of coastal zones for centuries. `Boom and bust' development of coastal
   zones is a historically recurrent problem. For nearly 40 years, there
   have been concerted efforts to improve management of the diverse human
   pressures that have led to deterioration of coastal environments. Since
   1992, Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been a dominant
   policy paradigm for bringing together relevant sectors of society to
   overcome conflicts of resource use and to pursue sustainable
   development. There is growing evidence that, with some exceptions, these
   efforts have not reversed environmental degradation. A major reason for
   this is that the economic and social changes leading to this decline
   operate increasingly at temporal and spatial scales greater than the
   scope of management regimes established through ICZM. Alternative
   approaches such as Adaptive Management are needed to deal with this
   mismatch of scales. Cross-scale tools including information technology
   and social networking may also provide vehicles for innovation. As part
   of a broader range of tools, ICZM helps respond to locally driven
   problems and adapt to global change. Effective future management must
   work across scales and benefit from the `long view' of how coupled
   social and ecological systems operate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Energy security management remains a complex and fragmented interplay
   between the population growth, urbanization, economical development and
   the living environment. Today, green technology application has been the
   prime contributor and an indispensable factor to preserve the long term
   reliability of energy supply. This agenda has called for an integrated,
   adaptive, coordinated, environmentally-oriented and participatory
   approach to the protection of renewable resources. Malaysia, endowed
   with its rich natural resources and diversity recognizes the need to
   adopt a sound developmental framework to transform the country's energy
   management landscape into a high quality and excellent level. Parallel
   to this development, both government and non-governmental organizations
   continue to advocate national efforts to explore alternative energy, and
   improve the dynamic energy growth in a cost-effective manner. The plan
   espouses the establishment of ocean energy, geothermal power,
   hydropower, wind power, hydrogen fuel cell, nuclear energy, biodiesel
   and bioethanol processing industries. The impetus is accompanied by the
   integration of environmental protection rules and boosted by the
   implementation of new energy policies. The present work attempts to
   address the opportunities, dynamic pressure, and coping strategies of
   energy security, and green energy development in Malaysia. The present
   and future outlooks of renewable and non-renewable energy are
   elucidated. Besides, the research breakthroughs and joint co-operations
   for the promotion of green energy management are outlined. (C) 2015

Title = {We are not all the same!: Comparative climate change vulnerabilities
   among fishers in Old Harbour Bay, Jamaica},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {47-59},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is a general consensus that Small Island Developing States are
   among the most vulnerable to experience climate injustices.
   Vulnerability studies of climate change effects on communities have
   often focused on differences between communities given these climate
   injustices. However, there is a need to also focus on vulnerability
   within communities, referred to here as comparative vulnerabilities.
   Climate justice therefore becomes even more important with more focused
   attention given to the nuances within groups that fall within the
   vulnerable category. This article examines comparative vulnerabilities
   for the fishing community in Jamaica. A survey of 241 fishers from Old
   Harbour Bay, the largest fishing village in Jamaica, was conducted to
   examine the level of vulnerability of different fishers to climate
   change. A vulnerability index was constructed for the community and then
   comparative vulnerabilities were determined based on socio-demographic
   characteristics. Overall for the sample 46.9\% of respondents would be
   considered as experiencing a comparatively high level of vulnerability
   to climate change. Climate change vulnerability was influenced by a
   number of socio-demographic variables with unique profiles emerging for
   groups that can be ranked as low, moderate, and high vulnerability. The
   paper therefore argues that within vulnerable populations there are
   comparative vulnerabilities based on economic factors and social
   capital, which must be taken into consideration for adaptation
   strategies to be implemented. Given these comparative vulnerabilities a
   more targeted approach to coping and adaptation strategies can then be
   taken. This will assist in building resilience of these communities that
   must now adjust to a new normal with climate change effects currently
   occurring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Nature-Based Solutions for Urban Climate Change Adaptation and

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Climate change and urbanisation in combination put great pressure on
   terrestrial and ocean ecosystems, vital for subsistence and wellbeing in
   both rural and urban areas of Pacific islands. Adaptation is urgently
   required. Nature-based solutions (NbS) offer great potential, with the
   region increasingly implementing NbS and linked approaches like
   ecosystem-based adaptation in response. This paper utilises three
   Pacific island nation case-studies, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu, to
   review current NbS approaches to adapt and mitigate the converging
   resilience challenges of climate change and urbanisation. We look at
   associated government policies, current NbS experience, and offer
   insights into opportunities for future work with focus on urban areas.
   These three Pacific island case-studies showcase their rich cultural and
   biological diversity and, importantly, the role of traditional
   ecological knowledge in shaping localised, place-based, NbS for climate
   change adaptation and enhanced wellbeing. But gaps in knowledge, policy,
   and practice remain. There is great potential for a nature-based urban
   design agenda positioned within an urban ecosystems framework linked
   closely to Indigenous understandings of wellbeing.</p>},

Title = {Beach nourishment is not a sustainable strategy to mitigate climate
   change},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {212},
Pages = {203-209},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Some studies published over the past several decades have concluded
   nourishment of oceanic beaches is a viable strategy to mitigate climate
   change. However, these were generally too limited in scope to accurately
   evaluate beach nourishment because each omit one or more of the
   following: (1) a realistic assessment of potential borrow area sand
   volume, (2) native beach compatibility, (3) construction costs, (4) all
   vulnerable geomorphic elements of the coastal zone, and (5)
   environmental impacts. When all of these parameters are considered, the
   results are markedly different. To demonstrate our point, we evaluated
   the recommendations of Houston (2017) using all five parameters.
   Contrary to Houston, we provide multiple lines of evidence that beach
   fill projects are not a sustainable strategy to protect or defend
   oceanic beaches of the Florida panhandle (USA), nor likely most of the
   world's developed coastlines at risk to the effects of climate change.
   The nourishment of oceanic beaches as historically constructed will
   surely continue over the next several decades. But, it must be done as
   an interim strategy during the formulation and implementation of a
   robust, long-term adaptive management strategy that incorporates managed
   withdrawal from the coastline.},

Title = {THE TROLLEY PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE: SHOULD GOVERNMENTS FACE TAKINGS
   LIABILITY IF ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES CAUSE PROPERTY DAMAGE?},
Journal = {COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {119},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1273-1309},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Faced with potentially staggering human and economic costs, governments
   around the world are beginning to plan and implement adaptive measures
   designed to stem the effects of climate change. Some of these
   adaptations will likely benefit certain property owners and communities
   at the expense of others. For example, seawalls intended to save
   valuable parcels of land from sea-level rise could wind up forcing
   seawater onto neighboring parcels that would not have flooded otherwise.
   One day in the not-too-distant future, societies will have to grapple
   with the question of whether the government is responsible for harms it
   causes in its attempts to save livelihoods and land threatened by
   climate change.
   This Note seeks to address that question by analyzing the extent to
   which a government in the United States would face takings liability if
   its adaptive measures to address sea-level rise-one of the most salient
   property harms that will result from climate change-save certain parcels
   but harm others. Despite a long line of case law under which the
   government is liable for a taking when it intentionally floods private
   property, this Note concludes that, under certain circumstances, climate
   change adaptations could present the type of emergency situation that
   American courts have frequently held exempts the government from takings
   liability. This Note nonetheless argues that broader government takings
   liability may lead to more efficient and equitable climate change
   adaptation. It also considers some undesirable outcomes that could
   result from broader government takings liability and discusses potential
   solutions to minimize those problems.},

Abstract = {The main drivers increasing pressure on urban drainage infrastructure,
   are climate change and population growth. Changes in rainfall
   characteristics and increment of urbanization are consequences of these
   factors, which can affect directly the level of flood risk. Furthermore,
   the combined effect of these two drivers and the tendency followed by
   them suggest an important increment of future flood risk, in particular
   in urban coastal areas. Traditional approaches for decision making when
   selecting measures to cope with floods focus on local characteristics,
   and offer strategies with low flexibility for adaptation to the
   uncertain future. Moreover, the use of sustainable or non-traditional
   drainage measures, also called sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), have
   been increasingly suggested in the last years mainly due to the multiple
   benefits that they offer to the environment. In this work a framework
   for selection and development of drainage strategies is presented. This
   framework combines multi-criteria analysis, multiple benefits
   assessment, hydrodynamic models, multi-objective optimisation tools,
   flexibility concepts and multi-functionality evaluation to achieve
   multi-functional and adaptive drainage strategies for the urban space.
   The proposed methodology is seen as a useful approach for helping
   decision making processes which aim to reduce urban flood risk, while at
   the same time allow the improvement of other environmental aspects. (C)

Abstract = {Papua New Guinea is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change
   since it encompasses 17,000 km of coastline, 600 low-lying islands, and

   manifestations of climate change. Climate change provides new and
   unprecedented challenges that demand equally new and urgent efforts to
   meet them. Research and development efforts are taking rapid strides
   forward in understanding what is going to happen to farming, fishery,
   and forest systems as the climate changes. The interactions that will
   occur with other global changes within this complex and dynamic
   situation, as well as the trade-offs between food security, livelihoods,
   and environmental security are also being studied. PNG is engaging new
   strategies, forging new partnerships and truly integrating approaches.

Abstract = {Coupled human-environmental timelines are used to explore the temporal
   coevolution of driving forces and adaptive strategies from the 1960s to
   2006 on Bellona in the SW Pacific. Climatic events and
   agro-environmental conditions are assessed in conjunction with issues
   such as population dynamics, agricultural strategies, non-agricultural
   activities, transport and infrastructure, migration, education,
   political conditions, etc. Satellite imagery and aerial photos reveal
   relative stability in agricultural land use intensity despite an
   increase in de facto population (51\% from 1966-2006). Results of
   questionnaire survey of 48 households show that the utilization of
   natural resources (notably shifting cultivation and fisheries) remains
   widespread, although it is increasingly supplemented by other income
   generating activities (e.g., shopkeeping, private business, government
   employment). Group interviews are used to discuss ways in which the
   local communities' adaptive resource management strategies have been
   employed in the face of climatic and socioeconomic events and changes in
   the recent past. Fifty years' development is described as a combination

Abstract = {Beach monitoring data are presented and show an average beach erosion
   trend of 0.5 m yr -1 in eight Caribbean islands over the period
   1985-2000, with elevated rates in those islands impacted by a higher
   number of hurricanes. The data are based on 5 to 15 years of continuous
   monitoring, conducted at three-month intervals, at 113 beaches (200
   profile sites) on eight islands, using standard methodology. The causes
   of the erosion are discussed and include anthropogenic factors, climate
   variability and projected climate change. Based on the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change projections for the Caribbean region, and the
   likely increase of anthropogenic stresses such as coastal development,
   it is likely that the beach erosion trend will continue and increase.
   Nonexclusive approaches to help beaches adapt to climate change include
   structural, planning or ecological measures. Two case studies
   illustrating climate change adaptation measures are discussed, one
   focuses on coastal planning measures in Anguilla and Nevis, and the
   second focuses on ecological measures, specifically the rehabilitation
   of a coastal forest in Puerto Rico. These case studies have not reached
   a stage where their effectiveness can be evaluated, however preliminary
   outcomes show that community-based climate change adaptation measures
   require careful planning such that the entire community is involved in a
   participatory manner and sufficient time is allocated for
   awareness-raising, information-sharing and discussion.},

Abstract = {The bigfin squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana, a commercially important
   fishery resource and also an object of sightseeing for diving, are under
   risk situation arising from current management procedure in Taiwan.
   Significant decline in abundance of bigfin squid and destruction of
   suitable substrates for spawning of neritic squids in coastal waters of
   Northeast Taiwan has been noted by local fishermen in recent years.
   Local divers arbitrarily deployed bamboo clusters as a squid aggregation
   device, for mating and spawning, in order to restore the abundance of
   squid. The deployment of the devices was not approved by the government,
   in particular the fishery authorities. Following conflict and
   compromises, the bamboo clusters were placed in restricted regions with
   permission from the local government. However, the interim management
   measure faced a serious challenge. The fishing activity of fishermen and
   recreational anglers, who were not consulted for the interim measure,
   targeted the aggregated squids putting them at risk. To prevent hazards,
   a theoretical management model was proposed to involve and direct
   essential stakeholders in conservation and sustainable utilization of
   the resource. A fishbone diagram and spiral model was created to analyze
   and illustrate the potential problems. Collaborative management tools
   were applied to coordinate the participants' duties and responsibilities
   and build the interrelationships between them. Finally, a modified
   management model based on adaptive management strategies was developed
   to cope with the changing situations. This modified management model
   process might further serve as an example for conservation and
   management measures of other fisheries resources. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This paper studies the dynamic application of the minimax regret (MR)
   decision criterion to identify robust flood risk management strategies
   under climate change uncertainty and emerging information. An MR method
   is developed that uses multiple learning scenarios, for example about
   sea level rise or river peak flow development, to analyse effects of
   changes in information on optimal investment in flood protection. To
   illustrate the method, optimal dike height and floodplain development
   are studied in a conceptual model, and conventional and adaptive MR
   solutions are compared. A dynamic application of the MR decision
   criterion allows investments to be changed after new information on
   climate change impacts, which has an effect on today's optimal
   investments. The results suggest that adaptive MR solutions are more
   robust than the solutions obtained from a conventional MR analysis of
   investments in flood protection. Moreover, adaptive MR analysis with
   multiple learning scenarios is more general and contains conventional MR
   analysis as a special case.},

   among small planters, the first methodological assessment of the
   technology needs for adaptation in the agriculture sector took place in
   Phase II of the global GEF-UNEP Technology Needs Assessment (TNA)
   project. In addition to providing a systematic approach for identifying
   and prioritizing adaptation technologies, the TNA project also sought to
   increase the preparedness of Mauritius for leveraging international
   climate financing and support for technology transfer. Since Mauritius
   was the only SIDS participating in Phase II of the TNA project, this
   chapter shares with other SIDS the methodology and lessons learned. The

Abstract = {Heat island phenomenon rises the temperature of cities, increases the
   energy demand for cooling and deteriorates comfort conditions in the
   urban environment To counterbalance the impact of the phenomenon,
   important mitigation techniques have been proposed and developed.
   Pavements present a very high fraction of the urban areas and contribute
   highly to the development of heat island in cities. The use of cool
   pavements presenting substantially lower surface temperature and reduced
   sensible heat flux to the atmosphere, appears to be one of the most
   important proposed mitigation solutions. The present paper investigates
   and describes the actual state of the art on the field of cool
   pavements. The main thermal and optical parameters defining the thermal
   performance of pavements are analyzed. Almost all of the developed
   technologies, where data and results are available, are considered while
   emphasis is given on the presentation of reflective and permeable/water
   retentive pavements. The main technological achievements on both fields
   are reviewed while existing applications are described and performance
   data are given when available. The existing results clearly show that
   the mitigation and cooling potential of cool pavements is very
   significant and can highly contribute to decrease temperature on the
   urban environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Nature-Based Engineering: A Review on Reducing Coastal Flood Risk With
   Mangroves},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Integration of mangroves in projects to reduce coastal flood risk is
   increasingly being recognised as a sustainable and cost-effective
   alternative. In addition to the construction of conventional hard flood
   protection infrastructure, mangroves not only contribute to attenuating
   flood events (functionality), they also recover in, and adapt to, a
   changing climate (persistence). The implementation of mangroves in flood
   risk reduction, however, remains complex. This is because the innate
   functionality and persistence of mangroves depend on a range of
   environmental conditions. Importantly, mangroves may collapse when
   environmental impacts or climatic changes exceed key system thresholds,
   bringing uncertainty into a situation where failure could endanger lives
   and livelihoods. The uncertainties in mangrove functionality and
   persistence can be dealt with by (1) improving insights in how
   ecological and physical processes affect mangrove functionality and
   persistence across scales, (2) advancing tools to accurately assess and
   predict mangrove functionality and persistence, and (3) adopting an
   adaptive management approach combined with appropriate engineering
   interventions to enhance mangrove functionality and persistence. Here,
   we review existing evidence, monitoring techniques and modelling
   approaches from the viewpoint of mangrove functionality and persistence.
   Inspired by existing guidelines for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to
   reduce flood risk, we provide an operationalization for this new
   approach. In addition, we identify where further research efforts are
   required for the practical application of mangroves in coastal flood
   risk management. Key aspects in the variability and uncertainty of the
   functionality and persistence of mangroves are their failure and
   recovery mechanisms, which are greatly site- and storm-specific. We
   propose five characteristic damage regimes that result in increasing
   reductions of mangrove functionality as well as post-storm recovery
   periods. Further research on the quantification of these regimes and
   their thresholds is required for the successful integration of mangroves
   in coastal flood risk management. Ultimately, the key challenge is the
   development of adaptive management strategies to optimise long-term
   mangrove functionality and persistence, or their resilience. Such
   adaptive strategies should be informed by continued mangrove
   functionality and persistence assessments, based on continued monitoring
   and modelling of key mangrove thresholds, and supported through
   well-established guidelines.},

Abstract = {Changing the course of Earth's climate is increasingly urgent, but there
   is also a concurrent need for proactive stewardship of the adaptive
   capacity of the rapidly changing biosphere. Adaptation ultimately
   underpins the resilience of Earth's complex systems; species,
   communities, and ecosystems shift and evolve over time. Yet oncoming
   changes will seriously challenge current natural resource management and
   conservation efforts. We review forward-looking conservation approaches
   to enable adaptation and resilience. Key opportunities include expanding
   beyond preservationist approaches by including those that enable and
   facilitate ecological change. Conservation should not just focus on
   climate change losers but also on proactive management of emerging
   opportunities. Local efforts to conserve biodiversity and generate
   habitat complexity will also help to maintain a diversity of future
   options for an unpredictable future.},

Title = {Turning Scientific Knowledge into Regulation: Effective Measures for
   Noise Mitigation of Pile Driving},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pile driving is one of the most intense anthropogenic noise sources in
   the marine environment. Each foundation pile may require up to a several
   thousand strokes of high hammer energy to be driven to the embedded
   depth. Scientific evidence shows that effects on the marine environment
   have to be anticipated if mitigation measures are not applied. Effective
   mitigation measures to prevent and reduce the impact of pile driving
   noise should therefore be part of regulation. The role of regulators is
   to demonstrate and assess the applicability, efficiency and
   effectiveness of noise mitigation measures. This requires both,
   scientific knowledge on noise impacts and the consideration of normative
   aspects of noise mitigation. The establishment of mitigation procedures
   in plans and approvals granted by regulatory agencies includes several
   stages. Here, we outline a step-wise approach in which most of the
   actions described may be performed simultaneously. Potential measures
   include the appropriate maritime spatial planning to avoid conflicts
   with nature conservation, site development for offshore wind farms to
   avoid undesirable activities in time and space, coordination of
   activities to avoid cumulative effects, and the application of technical
   noise abatement systems to reduce noise at the source. To increase the
   acceptance of noise mitigation applications, technical measures should
   fulfil a number of requirements: (a) they are applicable and affordable,
   (b) they are state-of-the-art or at least advanced in development, (c)
   their efficiency can be assessed with standardised procedures. In this
   study, the efficiency of noise mitigation applied recently in offshore
   wind farm construction projects in the German North Sea is explained and
   discussed with regard to the regulation framework, including the
   technical abatement of impulsive pile driving noise.},

Note = {9th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies,
   Washington, DC, NOV 16-20, 2008},
Abstract = {Along with public transport modification, building and consumer
   efficiency, renewable energy and bio-fuels, among other greenhouse gas
   mitigation strategies within the European Union (EU), Zero Emission
   Power utilising Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the key
   options to significantly reduce CO2 quickly as the world begins the
   transition away from fossil fuels and high CO2 emissions. Transporting
   CO2 from capture locations to storage sites will play an integral part
   in the implementation of this strategy, as geography, urbanism,
   regulation, regionalism and currently installed transport systems
   challenge the ability of the EU and its member states to store billions
   of tonnes of CO2 before the middle of this century.
   While the building of a CO2 transportation infrastructure is the primary
   subject of this paper, no discussion of transport can begin without at
   least a brief discussion of how and where CO2 will be safely and
   securely stored, and the identification and rationalization of the
   capture sites to the storage locations. Only after this exercise is
   complete can a transport infrastructure be devised that will safely
   deliver the captured CO2 for long-term storage and sequestration. The EU
   Zero Emissions Technology Platform SSI workgroup report used the latest
   data available from public sources to identify within each EU member
   state, both the largest point sources of CO2 emissions and the most
   likely storage locations. Early opportunities for success whereby
   relatively pure CO2 streams might be captured with minimal cost and
   complexity were also identified. Lastly, the concept of the EU Flagship
   programme was rationalized to storage locations. Recommendations were
   given for the assigned tasks.
   Within this context the SSI workgroup reviewed options that might afford
   member states the opportunity to begin the construction of transport
   systems and how an EU wide storage infrastructure might be devised and
   evolve, including efforts for the EU Flagship Programme, as well as a
   discussion on what such an infrastructure would likely not become. The
   report used as its primary analogue the history of the currently
   installed natural gas pipeline system in Northwest Europe. Transport
   considerations used estimations from energy modelling of how much CO2
   might ultimately be stored by 2050 as a basis for the EU wide transport
   design. From that, geographical and urban considerations, physical
   movement and pressure limitations, CO2 quality variations, regulatory
   impediments, legal options, economic unknowns and value chains, pubic
   acceptance and education, along with verifiable, certifiable storage
   locations, both offshore and onshore were used to create an overall
   transport scenario that may prove a workable option in the coming
   decades. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Climate Change Vulnerability and Risk Management Matrix for the
   Coastal Zone of The Gambia},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Global Climate Change is one of the dire challenges facing the
   international community today. Coastal zones are vulnerable to its
   impacts. An effective approach with long-term prospects in addressing
   climate change impacts is it's mainstreaming into development agenda of
   sectoral policies. A comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessment is
   a pre-requisite to ensure that the right adaptive response is taken for
   effective integration into developmental plans. The objective of this
   study is to evaluate and prioritize risks, vulnerability and adaptation
   issues of current and anticipated impacts of climate change on the
   coastal zone of The Gambia. The study will also give a methodological
   contribution for assessing risks, vulnerability and adaptation from the
   sub-national to local levels. The relevance of this study will be to
   create a link between the sub-national and local levels in order to
   facilitate the integration and mainstreaming of climate change into
   sectoral and local policies for more climate-resilient communities. This
   will aid in the promotion of strategic investment of constrained
   developmental resources to actualize successfully dynamic coping
   strategies, elude `maladaptation' and less compelling responsive
   measures. A purposive expert sampling technique was used in selecting
   respondents for the study. The findings of the study reveal that by the
   end of the 21st century, the climatic variables likely to have the
   highest impact on the coastal zone of The Gambia are `increased flood
   severity' and `increased temperature'. The coastal zone of The Gambia
   showed a high vulnerability to these climate change variables. The
   suggested adaptive response in addressing the impacts of increased flood
   intensity in the study area includes; improving regulations for
   restricting agriculture and livestock grazing activities to improve land
   cover; strengthening of early-warning systems, among others. The
   suggested adaptive response in addressing the increase in temperature
   includes: increase crop diversification and rotation to reduce total
   crop failure; switching to drought-tolerant crop and animal species,
   among others.},

Title = {Network-Level Risk-Based Framework for Optimal Bridge Adaptation
   Management Considering Scour and Climate Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Transportation networks, as an essential ingredient of civil
   infrastructure, are subjected to various natural hazards over their
   service life. Failure of bridges may severely disrupt the serviceability
   of transportation networks, causing considerable economic and social
   losses. Recently, climate change has been found to be liable for the
   increasing bridge vulnerability due to intensification of extreme
   hydrologic events (e.g., floods, sea level rise, and hurricanes). With
   the limited resources for infrastructure management and the growing risk
   compounded by climate change, effective risk-informed management for
   bridge adaptation actions is imperative for the safety and
   serviceability of transportation networks. This paper formulates a
   network-level, risk-based framework that determines the optimal
   adaptation schedules for bridges in a transportation network considering
   climate change effects. Bridge scour, one of the most common failure
   modes for bridges under floods, is investigated. The proposed framework
   (1) evaluates the consequences of bridge failure at the transportation
   network level, (2) considers climate change effects related to bridge
   scour using hydrologic modeling under different climate change
   scenarios, and (3) investigates the effects of budget availability and
   risk perception on the decision-making process. The proposed framework
   is demonstrated using an existing highway bridge network located in the
   Lehigh River watershed in Pennsylvania.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the ``protect/accommodate/retreat/avoid{''} or
   ``PARA{''} framework to categorize and examine flood disaster risk
   reduction approaches used to build climate change resilience in
   communities across Canada. We suggest that the PARA framework, first
   developed for climate change adaptation planning in communities facing
   sea level rise, is also a useful framework for flood risk reduction and
   flood resilience. The paper reviews four case studies of Canadian flood
   disaster risk reduction, with each case chosen to represent one of the
   four PARA risk reduction options. The extensive network of dikes and
   pumping stations employed in British Columbia's Lower Mainland (Fraser
   River) is used in the paper as an example of a ``protect{''} approach to
   flood risk reduction; Winnipeg, Manitoba's Basement Flood Relief Program
   is used to highlight the ``accommodate{''} approach; zoning changes and
   land expropriation following Toronto, Ontario's 1954 Hurricane Hazel
   flood disaster are used to showcase the ``retreat{''} approach; and,
   modern floodplain development planning approaches in Calgary, Alberta
   are used to highlight the ``avoid{''} approach. Overall, this paper
   contends that the PARA framework can be an effective approach for
   comprehensive flood disaster risk reduction and flood resilience;
   however, contextual factors, including equity considerations, should
   guide its application in situ.},

Abstract = {Recent warm temperatures driven by climate change have caused mass coral
   bleaching and mortality across the world, prompting managers,
   policymakers, and conservation practitioners to embrace restoration as a
   strategy to sustain coral reefs. Despite a proliferation of new coral
   reef restoration efforts globally and increasing scientific recognition
   and research on interventions aimed at supporting reef resilience to
   climate impacts, few restoration programs are currently incorporating
   climate change and resilience in project design. As climate change will
   continue to degrade coral reefs for decades to come, guidance is needed
   to support managers and restoration practitioners to conduct restoration
   that promotes resilience through enhanced coral reef recovery,
   resistance, and adaptation. Here, we address this critical
   implementation gap by providing recommendations that integrate
   resilience principles into restoration design and practice, including
   for project planning and design, coral selection, site selection, and
   broader ecosystem context. We also discuss future opportunities to
   improve restoration methods to support enhanced outcomes for coral reefs
   in response to climate change. As coral reefs are one of the most
   vulnerable ecosystems to climate change, interventions that enhance reef
   resilience will help to ensure restoration efforts have a greater chance
   of success in a warming world. They are also more likely to provide
   essential contributions to global targets to protect natural
   biodiversity and the human communities that rely on reefs.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Perhaps no subject is more intriguing and complex than climate change
   and its effects on ecosystems and their biological communities. Changes
   in precipitation and snowmelt patterns, sea level rise, increased
   intensity of storms and wet-weather events, thawing permafrost, changes
   in vegetation and wildlife composition and distribution, and other
   effects present significant policy and land management challenges.
   Scientific modeling and analyses demonstrate that the effects of a
   changing climate are complex, with high variability over time, space,
   and species, including effects on benthic organisms. The variable
   effects of a changing climate complicate decision making, rendering
   scenario planning, adaptive management, and other management learning
   tools increasingly important. The very complexity of effects presents
   particularly difficult challenges for policy makers and resource
   managers because the available science often is highly uncertain. Thus,
   other decision support tools are needed to help managers anticipate and
   respond to local and regional conditions. Effective policy and
   management require relevant science to inform decision making. Key needs
   include more assessments of ecosystem and species trends and their
   possible linkage to climate change and a better understanding of the
   interplay of multiple variables, how different management regimes might
   affect ecosystems and species survival, and how to apply risk management
   tools and adaptive management to resource issues.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a supply-and-demand model for the fisheries sector
   developed to assess the effect of climate change and related adaptation
   strategies in four Pacific coral triangle (CT) countries Fiji, Solomon
   Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. The modeling approach used in this
   paper represents climate change in terms of supply shocks, and works out
   its economic consequences using the microeconomic tools of supply and
   demand. The analysis has considered three time periods: current
   (represented by the average data of the three most recent available
   years 2006-2009), medium term (2035), and long term (2050). The study
   covers all fisheries and aquaculture species, grouped into six key
   subsectors: tuna, other oceanic finfish, coastal finfish, coastal
   invertebrates, freshwater finfish, and freshwater invertebrates. Results
   of the baseline model indicate that with rising per capita income and
   population, fish demand is expected to increase substantially up to
   2050. In contrast to significant growth in fish demand, growth in
   domestic fish production is projected to be slow due to climate change
   and other constraints. There is a strong likelihood that many Pacific
   countries will become large net importers of fish under the baseline
   scenario (i.e., without implementing climate change adaptation
   strategies). Likewise, per capita consumption of domestically produced
   fish is projected to decline under the baseline scenario. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This paper aims to address the contribution of Cooperative Intelligent
   Transport Systems (C-ITS) services to the mitigation of climate change
   impacts in road transport. Climate change is a fact perturbing human
   activities in various ways. The exacerbation of weather conditions has
   considerable impacts on transportation, hence indicating transport
   vulnerability to climate change. Europe is already confronting several
   changes in the climatic conditions, including increased temperatures,
   extreme precipitation events, cold waves and sea level rise. Interaction
   between climate change and road transport is evident in terms of
   increasing risks for network managers and users, and negatively
   affecting transport performance major parameters, such as safety,
   reliability and cost efficiency. The need to limit adverse weather
   conditions effects to road transport urges to adapt new mitigation
   policies, which will ensure transport resilience and sustainability.
   C-ITS services constitute an innovative array of technologies, enabled
   by digital connectivity among vehicles and between vehicles and
   transport infrastructure, expected to significantly improve road safety,
   traffic efficiency and comfort of driving. In this way C-ITS services
   have the potential to increase the levels of safety for drivers within
   extreme weather situations, by helping them to take the right decisions
   and adapt to the traffic situation. The C-MobILE project, funded under
   the Horizon 2020 programme, envisions a fully safe and efficient road
   transport without casualties and serious injuries on European roads, by
   deploying C-ITS services for specific mobility challenges. The project
   will execute large scale C-ITS deployment activities in eight cities in
   Europe. The C-ITS services will be provided in bundles, aiming to
   improve safety and traffic efficiency. The paper includes an extended
   review of the relevant literature. Then an assessment of the C-MobILE
   C-ITS services' potential contribution to the mitigation of these
   effects is presented and assessed.},

Abstract = {The rising of coastal flood due to the climate change that occurred in
   Cilincing area, North Jakarta, has forced the community to take some
   adaptation strategies. However, the current adaptation strategy only
   emphasizes on the economic and physical, while ignoring the psychology
   and the social aspects also play a vital role in deciding a proper
   strategy towards the problem. The purpose of this study was to identify
   the relationship of each variable that forms psycho-social adaptation to
   coastal flooding. Quantitative approach was used by using Spearman
   correlation analysis between 3 variables namely psychological
   adaptation, sociological adaptation, and anthropological adaptation. The
   data obtained questionnaires in the Cilincing area using random
   sampling. Based on the results, it can be inferred that psychological
   adaptation determines society's sociological and anthropological
   adaptation. Psychological adaptation has a negative relationship to
   sociological adaptation with a correlation coefficient (R) = -0,298 with
   significant value0,00. Indicating the higher the psychological
   adaptation, the lower the sociological adaptation of society.
   Sociological adaptation has a positive relationship to anthropological
   adaptation with correlation coefficient (R) = 0,474 with significant
   value0,00. Indicating the higher the sociological adaptation, the higher
   the anthropological adaptation.},

Abstract = {Certain communities along the coast of Ketu South Municipality in
   south-eastern Ghana, remain vulnerable to coastal flood events from
   storm surges, high tidal waves, lagoon overflow, and heavy rainfall.
   However, the local conditions that make these communities vulnerable are
   poorly understood and knowledge on which communities are most vulnerable
   is lacking. This study improves the conceptual understanding of
   different dimensions of vulnerability that exist across the communities
   and the various levels of vulnerability that each exposed community
   exhibits. The study surveyed 354 household heads from selected
   flood-prone communities including Blekusu, Agavedzi, Salakope, Amutsinu,
   and Adina. The survey collected data on demographic, social, economic,
   physical, exposure, and adaptive capacity to flood hazards. The data was
   then used to construct composite vulnerability indices at community
   levels. Results from the study demonstrate that the communities have
   different levels of vulnerability as a result of differences in their
   exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity levels. The willingness to
   relocate as an adaptation strategy was determined by household flood
   duration, number of livelihoods, and sea defence preference. These
   results are relevant to flood disaster management programs and the
   adoption of effective adaptation measures that take into account local
   knowledge. The findings imply that interventions aimed at reducing
   vulnerability should take into account household characteristics, as
   well as flood exposure, and adaptive capacity factors.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have made significant advancements in understanding the
   localized effects of urban warming in cities in the South Asian context.
   Taking the case of Khulna city, Bangladesh, in this paper we follow a
   two-pronged approach. First, we use remote sensing techniques to analyze
   the changing land use and land cover patterns (LULC) and their
   relationship with emerging land surface temperature (LST) change, that
   results in urban heat islands (UHI). Second, we follow up on the
   emergent results from the remote sensing analysis to draw key links with
   the existing UHI spatio-temporal variations with existing and future
   planning pathways. Our findings suggest that rapidly reducing green
   spaces and increased built-up areas are contributing strongly towards
   increasing UHI. The overall increase of LST in the city is nearly 2
   degrees C in the past 5 years, which calls for more urgent climate
   adaptive planning and action. Document analysis of the Khulna city
   master plan demonstrates that several mitigation strategies were
   initiated through the Khulna Master Plan 2001, yet key implementation
   barriers continue to persist. We conclude by arguing for a holistic
   approach to green space planning in the city (through strategic action
   and institutional planning approaches), coupled with local scaled
   adaptation and mitigation strategies, that can help the planning process
   to deal with the challenges associated with UHI increase in urban areas.},

Title = {Managing coastal environments under climate change: Pathways to
   adaptation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {572},
Pages = {1336-1352},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {This paper deals with the question of how to manage vulnerable coastal
   systems so as to make them sustainable under present and future
   climates. This is interpreted in terms of the coastal functionality,
   mainly natural services and support for socio-economic activities. From
   here we discuss how to adapt for long term trends and for short terms
   episodic events using the DPSIR framework.
   The analysis is presented for coastal archetypes from Spain, Ireland and
   Romania, sweeping a range of meteo-oceanographic and socio-economic
   pressures, resulting in a wide range of fluxes among them those related
   to sediment. The analysis emphasizes the variables that provide a higher
   level of robustness. That means mean sea level for physical factors and
   population density for human factors. For each of the studied cases high
   and low sustainability practices, based on stakeholders preferences, are
   considered and discussed. This allows proposing alternatives and
   carrying out an integrated assessment in the last section of the paper.
   This assessment permits building a sequence of interventions called
   adaptation pathway that enhances the natural resilience of the studied
   coastal systems and therefore increases their sustainability under
   present and future conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A new criterion and probabilistic approach to the performance assessment
   of coastal facilities in relation to their adaptation to global climate
   change},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {113-121},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {``Maximum allowable wave height{''} is proposed as a new criterion for
   assessing the performance of coastal facilities when planning a strategy
   for adapting these facilities to global climate change. Since it
   considers the prevention of wave overtopping and the structural strength
   of coastal facilities such as seawalls or breakwaters as measures of
   performance, this new criterion can represent the reduction in
   performance of coastal facilities due to sea level rise or of a greater
   frequency of tropical cyclones induced by global climate change. This
   study proposes a probabilistic approach to assess the performance of
   coastal structures. Using this approach, the time-dependent encounter
   probability, the return period, and modified residual life are
   introduced as new indices for making decisions on adaptation strategies.
   A useful characteristic of these indices is that they make possible the
   direct comparison of different physical quantities such as wave
   overtopping and structural strength. Case studies were conducted in
   order to verify the validity of this approach. The proposed approach is
   considered to be beneficial in planning an adaptation strategy related
   to global climate change. A more accurate assessment can be made through
   case studies of its application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation and Sectoral Policy Coherence in the Caribbean},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change is an existential threat to small island developing
   states. Policy coherence aims to create synergies and avoid conflicts
   between policies. Mainstreaming adaptation across multiple sectors and
   achieving greater coherence amongst policies is needed. The paper
   applies qualitative document analysis, content analysis, and expert
   interviews to examine the degree of coherence between climate-sensitive
   sector policies in framing climate change adaptation and the adaptation
   goals outlined in the national development plan and national climate
   change policies in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), Grenada, and
   Saint Lucia. The results indicate that adaptation is not fully
   integrated into the water, agriculture, coastal zone, and forestry
   policies. For example, while adaptation was explicitly addressed in
   Saint Lucia's water policy, it was not explicitly addressed in SVG's and
   Grenada's water policy. The results show that Saint Lucia has the
   highest coherence score (93.52) while St. Vincent and the Grenadines has
   the lowest (91.12). The optimal coherence score that can be possibly
   obtained is 147, which indicates partial coherence in adaptation
   mainstreaming in sectoral policies. Expert interviews highlighted
   problems such as institutional arrangements, a silo approach, funding
   mechanisms, and policy implementation. Using the knowledge provided by
   the experts, a seven-step process is proposed to practically achieve
   policy coherence and operationalize the policies.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Over the past years the concern of the international scientific
   community towards the study of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon
   has been growing. Such issue is particularly important in cities as
   Rome, where it is possible to experience intense heat stress conditions
   especially when heat waves intensify this phenomenon. Therefore this
   study wants to examine different mitigation strategies of the urban
   microclimate by taking into consideration the campus of the Sapienza
   University of Rome. It was carried out through the software ENVI-met V
   3.1 which gave the possibility to reproduce the model of the site
   (experimentally calibrated) and examine, in terms of MOCI (Mediterranean
   Outdoor Comfort Index), the different mitigation strategies implemented.
   This index was also related to the Apparent Temperature and to the
   health risk. Among the main results provided through this study, it is
   possible to notice how the solution combining cool roofs, urban
   vegetation and cool pavement leads, with respect to the current
   configuration of the site, to a mean and maximum decrease in the MOCI of
   -2.5 and -3.5. Finally it is able to determine a decrease of about 60\%
   in the health risk for those who are exposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Urban heat islands are an increasing concern even in small- to
   medium-sized cities, although these areas are still understudied
   especially in terms of the economic feasibility of adaptation options.
   This paper uses adaptation scenarios produced by an urban climate model
   as inputs to a social cost-benefit analysis in three small- to
   medium-sized cities in Austria: Modling, Klagenfurt, and Salzburg. The
   adaptation scenarios, which consider measures such as increasing the
   reflectivity of different sealed surfaces (referred to as the White City
   scenario) as well as greening measures (i.e. the Green City scenario),
   show decreases in the number of hot days (T-max >= 30 degrees C) when
   implemented. Benefits include reductions in heat-related mortality,
   which are modeled based on trends of daily mortality and climate data,
   reduced morbidity, productivity loss, and numerous urban ecosystem
   services. The results demonstrate favorable benefit-cost ratios of a
   combination of measures (White and Green City) of 1.27, 1.36, and 2.68
   for Modling, Klagenfurt, and Salzburg, respectively, indicating positive
   economic grounds for supporting policies in line with the adaptation
   scenarios. Furthermore, results of the Green City vs. White City showed
   higher benefits for the combined and Green City scenarios despite higher
   costs for each of the cities.},

Abstract = {The issues related to the global warming are increasingly becoming of
   crucial importance for governments and scientific communities, which are
   trying to develop policies and solutions to slow down this problem in
   order to limit the related negative effects on environment, human health
   and economy. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, i.e. the increasing
   of temperatures within cities with respect to the neighbouring rural
   spaces, is one of the main aspects related to such a global warming. In
   this regard, cool road pavements can be really considered as a valuable
   technological solution to mitigate such a phenomenon. Given this
   background, the present paper illustrates a comprehensive experimental
   investigation principally aimed at providing a specific overview of the
   main thermal behaviour of selected clear and coloured mixtures for
   pavement surface courses as mitigation strategy for the UHI phenomenon.
   To this aim, specific indoor (laboratory) and outdoor monitoring were
   carried out on samples subjected to artificial radiations and sun
   exposure, respectively. Basic chromatic characteristics and mechanical
   properties of such materials were also investigated to evaluate
   prospective correlations with the thermal response as well as real field
   applicability. Clear mixtures were prepared using traditional limestone
   or unusual white marble aggregates bound with a synthetic transparent
   resin whereas the coloured mixtures were obtained by adding oxide
   pigments (red or yellow) to a plain bituminous blend. A traditional
   reference black bituminous mixture was also studied for comparison
   purposes. The experimental findings mainly showed that an optimisation
   of the thermal response of pavement surface can be achieved leading to
   remarkable temperature reductions also interesting the surrounding
   environment, in particular when a transparent binder is used. However,
   some issues related to the mechanical properties of clear mixes should
   be addressed since they could limit the real applicability of such
   materials.},

Abstract = {Urban flooding due to high-intensity rainfall along coastal Semarang
   City is a major problem every winter. Such urban flooding cannot be
   avoided, but it can be controlled. Thus, it is necessary to extract real
   information regarding the flood events as well as to understand the
   landscape of Semarang using an integrated approach of remote sensing and
   a geographic information system (GIS) together with field measurements
   to propose reliable mitigation measures. In this work, the digital
   elevation model (DEM) of Semarang was used to automatically extract all
   the morphometric and hydrological parameters. In addition, different
   satellite images (optical and radar) were used to map the land surface
   features and to estimate the subsidence rate that affects the city and
   changes the land slope. Moreover, geological, structural, and
   groundwater maps were integrated in a GIS database. Consequently,
   several measures were proposed to mitigate the flooding. These measures
   are: construct prevention dams at the up streams, striate the meandering
   rivers, dredge the water channels to increase discharge, increase the
   river levee height, inject the excess water into a productive
   groundwater aquifer after performing quantitative hydrological modeling,
   construct a separate drain network (totally different than the sewer
   system), and, finally, install artificial water infiltration and
   attenuation systems in the flat areas. The locations and design of all
   these mitigation measures were mapped in a GIS format.},

Abstract = {Investment decisions about capital-intensive, long-lived infrastructure
   are challenging due to uncertainty about their future performance,
   particularly if the performance is sensitive to climate change. Such
   investments, like those made for water infrastructure, are rarely
   evaluated over their total operational lifetime, during which
   socio-economic and environmental changes can cause potential lock-ins
   and reduced options for future choices that lead to high costs to
   transfer to other options. We propose an economic evaluation framework
   to explore adaptation pathways, or sequences of strategic investments
   options, that can be implemented if needed due to changing conditions. A
   novel feature is the inclusion of ``transfer costs{''} associated with a
   switch to alternative pathways to allow adaptive decision-making and to
   minimize the cost of adjustment over time. Implementing a pathway-driven
   approach represents a break with most institutional decision-making
   processes and can significantly improve decision-making under
   uncertainty compared to the conventional single-investment perspective.
   We present a case study on flood risk management in the Netherlands to
   show the long-term socio-economic consequences of short-term decisions
   by going beyond the project cycle horizon.},

Abstract = {Recent catastrophic losses because of floods require developing
   resilient approaches to flood risk protection. This article assesses how
   diversification of a system of coastal protections might decrease the
   probabilities of extreme flood losses. The study compares the
   performance of portfolios each consisting of four types of flood
   protection assets in a large region of dike rings. A parametric analysis
   suggests conditions in which diversifications of the types of included
   flood protection assets decrease extreme flood losses. Increased return
   periods of extreme losses are associated with portfolios where the asset
   types have low correlations of economic risk. The effort highlights the
   importance of understanding correlations across asset types in planning
   for large-scale flood protection. It allows explicit integration of
   climate change scenarios in developing flood mitigation strategy.},

Title = {The Role of Traditional Knowledge in Building Adaptive Capacity for
   Climate Change: Perspectives from Vanuatu},
Journal = {WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {545-561},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is increasing recognition of traditional knowledge as an important
   store of information and practices for building adaptive capacity for
   climate change in the Pacific. However, empirical research and
   documentation of how Pacific Islanders experience climate change,
   identify relevant adaptation options, and mobilize their adaptive
   capacity, including traditional knowledge, remains limited. Given this
   context, indigenous islander perspectives on traditional knowledge and
   its role in building their adaptive capacity are examined in this
   article. The author draws on research with the Nakanamanga-speaking
   peoples of Tongoa Island, Vanuatu. This research documents traditional
   knowledge relating to weather and climate observations; resource use and
   management; social networks; local leadership; and values and beliefs in
   these indigenous communities and reveals differing perspectives about
   its potential to enhance local adaptive capacity. It highlights
   indigenous concerns about self-reliance, cultural continuity, and how
   the transition to a cash economy, the valorization of Western education
   and lifestyles, and rural-urban migration have had adverse implications
   for traditional knowledge and its retention. It further reveals
   potential trade-offs for indigenous communities on Tongoa Island, where
   traditional governance, tenure systems, and values enable flexibility
   and collective action that build adaptive capacity but can also promote
   conservative attitudes and limit uptake of new information and
   practices.},

Abstract = {Ben Tre Province in Vietnam is ranked among the most vulnerable places

   community knowledge, awareness, perception severity, coping mechanism
   and adaptation to climate change in Ben Tre Province. Community members
   were aware of changing climatic conditions. About 90\% of respondents
   suffered losses from salt water intrusion. Households adopted coping
   mechanisms to deal with these changes. Age, education and previous
   affliction with climate change events influence knowledge, awareness,
   perception of severity and preparedness to manage climate change events.
   Local governments proposed adaptation strategies such as building of
   dikes to prevent salt water intrusion and developing of irrigation
   systems. Of the two adaptation strategies evaluated to losses from
   climate change, the sea dike system protected more land but the
   irrigating system was more cost effective in mitigating losses from
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts lead to alterations in migration patterns and the
   displacement of exposed native communities and peoples in the Arctic
   region, forcing them to leave their homes and traditional ways of life
   as a result of rapid local ecological changes. This paper illustrates
   climate-related displacements and subsequent relocation as extremely
   complex processes, and proposes traditional knowledge as a relevant
   source of knowledge both at local level and policy making spheres.
   The main conclusions are that the representation of indigenous peoples
   in international governance structures does not guarantee that
   traditional knowledge is entirely engaged in evidence-based policy
   making and that traditional knowledge is not always valued as an equal
   source of knowledge by some relevant scientific bodies. In this context,
   changing the approach towards a knowledge-systems-based framework would
   contribute to the development of more concrete policies and strategies
   for adaptation of Arctic native communities.},

Title = {Drivers of flood and climate change risk perceptions and intention to

Abstract = {This article contributes to current research about determinants of
   climate change and flood risk perception, and intentions to take
   adaptive measures. We propose a research model that distinguishes
   between vulnerability and severity components of perceived risks, and
   adds perceived adaptive capacity as a third factor to predict the
   intention to take adaptive measures. We used this combined model as a
   conceptual lens for an explorative survey among 1086 residents of
   coastal and delta communities in Vietnam. Pairwise analyses revealed a
   significant association of flood and climate change risk perceptions
   with individual's flood experience, climate change knowledge, frequency
   of community participation and socio-demographic factors. However, in
   multivariate analysis, the influence of most socio-demographic factors
   became weak or patchy. Flood experience was the most influential driver
   of flood-related risk perceptions but weak for climate change-related
   risk perceptions and behavioural intentions. Knowledge strongly
   increased the intention to adapt to flood and climate risks and the
   perceived vulnerability to and severity of climate change risks, but
   reduced the perceived capacity to adapt to climate risks. Frequency of
   community participation increased the perceived vulnerability and
   severity of climate change risks, the intention to adapt to both climate
   and flood risks and the perceived capacity to adapt to flood risks, but
   reduced the perceived capacity to adapt to climate risks. Our research
   confirms earlier findings that individuals' knowledge, place-specific
   experience and social-cultural influences are key predictors of both
   flood and climate change risk perceptions and intentions to take
   adaptive measures. These factors should therefore receive ample
   attention in climate risk communication.},

Abstract = {Climate change as a major issue in the 21st century has seen the rise of
   the sea level and worse storm surges. This has impacted on the further
   distribution of salinity and flooding of low laying areas even in
   further inland areas. As the consequence, buildings in the proximity of
   riverbanks are left susceptible to potential damages and shortened life
   cycles. Thus, there is a real need to change the way buildings in these
   areas to be designed and how risk of damages can be mitigated and
   managed. The city of Perth in Western Australia, like many other cities
   around the world, is laying on the riverbank of a large river, the Swan
   River. As the population of Perth increases dramatically, it will become
   important to ensure sustainability of its buildings to support the ever
   growing populations and hence its needs. There are myriads of approaches
   in mitigating and managing these risks. This research project aims to
   investigate the contemporary risk management practices in mitigating
   flooding risk in buildings adjacent to the Swan River and bring them
   together as a holistic risk management approach. The findings of this
   research can be proposed to the Western Australian government to assist
   them in developing further policies in ensuring sustainable buildings
   fit for the future. At this point of writing, the research project is on
   its early stage of conducting literature review and designing the
   research methodology. It is intended to conduct a pilot survey, followed
   by case study approach of contemporary buildings adjacent to the Swan
   River to contextualize the research. This paper presents the current
   progress of this research. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing
   coastal communities today. Coastal communities are subject to a wide
   range of stressors related to climate change, including biological
   resource decline and natural hazards. Small historically
   natural-resource-dependent communities are particularly vulnerable
   because of their close reliance on ecosystem goods and services that are
   likely to be affected by climate change (e.g., fisheries, forests) and
   their limited access to outside technical and financial resources needed
   for adaptation. Exogenous adaptation policies, while helpful for
   fostering new behavioral adjustments to address resource decline and
   natural hazards, can in some cases exacerbate socioeconomic disruption,
   further burdening communities already struggling to adapt. This paper
   presents an investigation of how six historically
   natural-resource-dependent coastal communities in Oregon, USA, have
   experienced and responded to external stressors and how adaptation in
   these communities has been shaped by interactions between past and
   present practices, processes, and vulnerabilities. Despite
   climate-related impacts identified by the scientific community, climate
   change was not salient in the community members' reports of stressors
   and impacts, and thus was not a trigger of adaptation. Rather,
   communities were responding to stressors associated with decades of
   declines in natural resource industries, an economic recession,
   restrictive natural resource management and land use policies,
   demographic change, and natural hazards. These findings confirm other
   research findings that chronic everyday problems, including those
   related to the maintenance of livelihoods, or consequences of inadequate
   livelihoods, often eclipse potentially disastrous threats in the minds
   of rural community members, thereby influencing adaptation strategies.
   In some cases communities do not prioritize such threats because people
   have come to accept living with them, or they feel powerless and unable
   to change the circumstances of daily life. The findings improve
   understanding of adaptation in natural-resource based coastal
   communities in the USA and support the need for policy makers and
   planners to integrate climate change adaptation into livelihood
   improvement strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tourism plays an important role in economic and human development in the
   Pacific. These benefits are at risk from the impacts of climate change,
   threatening the sustainability of the Pacific tourism sector. We assess
   the vulnerability and resilience of nature-based tourism in Vava'u,
   Tonga, using the Destination Sustainability Framework of Calgaro (2014)
   modified for a climate change focus. Our empirical assessment indicates
   that the following factors increase vulnerability levels in Vava'u:
   strong seasonality, dependency on air access, remoteness, limited
   connectivity of Vava'u from national decision makers and limited human
   and financial resources. Resilience levels in Vava'u are heightened by a
   high awareness of climate change, the resilient nature of Tongans and
   strong family and social networks. In conclusion, we recommend a set of
   adaptation strategies to further improve resilience levels, namely
   improving climate change education, increasing product and market
   diversification, strengthening institutional capacities and
   mainstreaming adaptation in national policies.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {59},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is an increasing concern that the current management practices for
   many coastal regions are unsustainable. Very few countries have planned
   to deal with the exacerbation of environmental decline in the face of
   sea level rise. It is therefore necessary to assess socioeconomic and
   environmental impacts of sea level rises to better understand the
   vulnerability of coastal zones, as part of devising adaptive and
   integrated management principles. This paper presents a systematic
   approach by which relevant stakeholders can be actively engaged in
   prioritising flood impact issues and deriving information for
   quantification of impacts for adaptation measures and demonstrates the
   approach through implementation in the Gippsland coastal region. As
   outcomes of the project, we have identified key issues of concern for
   this region for flood impacts and constructed synthetic response
   functions for quantification of impacts of floods on some of the key
   issues in the region. The analysis also showed that stakeholders
   consider that some of the issues are not likely to be significantly
   affected by floods and thus may not require adaptation measures. The
   analysis did not provide high agreement on some issues. Different
   approaches are required to assess the importance of these issues and to
   establish impact response functions for them.},

Abstract = {Rapid population growth, urbanization, and concentration of valuable
   assets and strategic infrastructure in coastal regions make coastal
   inundation, flooding, and storm surge national problems for many
   countries, including theUnited States of America (USA). Enhancing
   coastal resilience is a complex problem and involves an integrated risk
   management approach, entailing both structural protection as well as
   other risk reduction strategies (e.g., building codes and ecosystem
   preservation). The former is an increasingly recognized mitigation
   option for densely populated areas and industrial hubs. Fully justifying
   benefits of costly flood defense structures is crucial, particularly
   when lack of funding and other institutional barriers make such projects
   easy targets for omission from or cuts to a budget. Justification
   usually requires a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. This paper
   explores the economic feasibility of a coastal barrier, i.e., coastal
   spine, as a potential storm surge mitigation strategy to protect the
   Houston-Galveston metropolitan area of Texas, one of the most
   flood-prone and economically important regions in the USA. We provide an
   assessment of residential and chemical manufacturing plant and refinery
   exposure to multiple synthetic hurricane storm surge events by comparing
   losses with and without a coastal spine. While under all scenarios,
   benefits exceed engineering costs of a spine, our results indicate that
   the project feasibility largely hinges on accounting for industrial
   losses and resultant indirect and induced effects. As many regions and
   industrial hubs globally are designing adaptation and mitigation
   strategies to combat the consequences of extreme events, structural
   solution to surge mitigation maybe one of the few mitigation options for
   them. Unlike population and residential structures that can retreat and
   insure, these options are not viable for industrial plants that are
   resource-based. However, expertise and knowledge pertinent to surge
   barrier systems are relatively scarce as there are only handful of
   barriers around the world and they are all unique in engineering
   designs. As storm surge is becoming a threat for many coastal urban
   centers, one of the recommendations is to consolidate knowledge base and
   research across countries in order to foster knowledge exchange
   internationally. This will help identify concerns associated with
   existing barrier systems, pragmatic ways to improve them and will also
   aid the investment decision, engineering designs, and operational
   aspects of barriers in other parts of the world. Furthermore, forming
   regional research collaborations with developing countries at risk of
   storm surge and the sea level rise is vital to further facilitate
   knowledge spillover and exchange of expertise.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of scientists and resource managers recognise that
   successful marine management approaches, including marine spatial
   planning (MSP), cannot occur without effective monitoring, evaluation
   and adaptation. These basic components are necessary to ensure that any
   marine planning or marine management measures are both effective and
   efficient. While a number of fundamental principles for marine
   monitoring, evaluation and adaptive management exist, there are varying
   levels of understanding about how these should be undertaken and what
   they may achieve. Challenges include the development of realistic and
   measurable objectives and indicators against which effectiveness can be
   practically measured. The matter becomes even more complicated as the
   focus of marine planning and management strategies changes from `single
   species' to `habitats' and `ecosystems' that may enable a diversity of
   permitted uses consistent with a variety of overall objectives. Over the
   last 30 years, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) has
   successfully established a multiple-use spatial management approach that
   allows both high levels of environmental protection and a wide range of
   human activities. Drawing on this unique long-term experience in the
   GBRMP, this article discusses key aspects of effective monitoring and
   evaluation, and summarises lessons learned from over two decades of
   adaptive management. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Challenges, opportunities, and climate change adaptation strategies of
   mangrove-agriculture ecosystem in the Sundarbans, India: a review},

Volume = {30},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The mangrove-agriculture system is a distinct ecosystem that evolved in
   the Sundarbans, India in the last century due to anthropogenic
   activities and climate change consequences. Degraded-mangrove and
   agriculture (rice-based systems and aquaculture) exist side by side,
   each having their specific challenges and opportunities. In this review,
   we analyzed challenges faced by this unique ecosystem along with
   opportunities derived from technological advancement and site-specific
   climate change adaptation strategies. Both the mangrove and lowland rice
   ecosystem could act as carbon (C) sink to the tune of 27 and 0.93 t
   ha(-1) per annum, respectively. Apart from C sequestration,
   mangrove-rice systems provide many ecosystem services. However, 40\% of
   tropical and 10.5\% of Sundarban mangroves (between 1930 and 2013), have
   been lost due to climate change induced sea-level rise, extreme weather
   events and human interferences. The specific challenges in this system
   are freshwater scarcity, high salinity, insufficient real-time seed
   supply, poor fertilizer-management, lack of irrigation network, and
   unprecedented occurrence of extreme events which seriously hamper the
   productivity of mangrove, rice, and aquaculture. There also exist some
   unique opportunities in terms of cheap labour availability,
   mangrove-conservation acts, cheap river-communication, and scope of
   ecotourism which fortunately get the attention of national and
   international funding agencies. In the last section of this review, we
   recommended ten climate change adaptation strategies that may be
   considered at the policy and farmer levels. The strategies broadly
   include the development of small-scale rainwater harvesting structures
   in series, the introduction of salt tolerant cultivars with water
   management, land shaping, establishment of multipurpose cyclone shelter
   at each block and empowerment of women through self-help groups.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of inundation, erosion, and wave
   damage for a coastal community in Rhode Island, USA. A methodology
   called the Coastal Environmental Risk Index (CERI) was used that
   incorporates levels of inundation including sea level rise, wave heights
   using STWAVE, and detailed information about individual structures from
   an E911 database. This information was input into damage functions
   developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers following Hurricane Sandy.
   Damage from erosion was evaluated separately from local published
   erosion rates. Using CERI, two different adaptation strategies were
   evaluated that included a combination of dune restoration, protective
   berms, and a tide gate. A total of 151 out of 708 structures were
   estimated to be protected from inundation and wave action by the
   combined measures. More importantly, the use of CERI allowed for the
   assessment of the impact of different adaptation strategies on both
   individual structures and an entire community in a Geographical
   Information Systems (GIS) environment. This tool shows promise for use
   by coastal managers to assess damage and mitigate risk to coastal
   communities.},

Abstract = {An investigation of public support for coastal adaptation options and
   public finance options in Florida evaluated stakeholder judgments and
   how they changed through a participatory engagement process. The study
   found that public finance mechanisms that imposed fiscal burdens on
   those who directly benefit from hazard reduction were rated as more
   acceptable than others. Significantly, visualisations and data on local
   economic damage and return on investment of potential adaptation options
   further increased acceptability ratings. The question of whether a
   development fee for adaptation or any other public purpose supported by
   private funds is a legal issue that depends on a test called the
   rational nexus. One concern of this article is to explore options for
   such fees to cover adaptation to climate change. This raises issues
   about the potential conflict with the community-wide and
   intergenerational nature of long-term adaptation. We also explore the
   relevance of environmental attitudes using the `new environmental
   paradigm' (NEP) scale and political party affiliation. Results have
   implications for infrastructure improvements that require public
   approval for financing.},

Title = {THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEASURES TO REDUCE THE MAN-MADE GREENHOUSE-EFFECT -
   THE APPLICATION OF A CLIMATE-POLICY MODEL},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {103-118},
Abstract = {In this paper we briefly describe the characteristics and the
   performance of our 1-D Muenster Climate Model. The model system consists
   of coupled models including gas cycle models, an energy balance model
   and a sea level rise model. The chemical feedback mechanisms among
   greenhouse gases are not included. This model, which is a
   scientifically-based parameterized simulation model, is used here
   primarily to help assess the effectiveness of various plausible policy
   options in mitigating the additional man-made greenhouse warming and the
   resulting sea level rise.
   For setting priorities it is important to assess the effectiveness of
   the various measures by which the greenhouse effect can be reduced. To
   this end we take a Scenario Business-as-Usual as a reference case
   (Leggett et al., 1992) and study the mitigating effects of the following
   four packages of measures: The Copenhagen Agreements on CFC, HCFC, and
   halon reduction (GECR, 1992), the Tropical Forest Preservation Plan of
   the Climate Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament on CO, reduction
   (ECGP, 1990), a detailed reduction scheme for energy-related CO2 (ECGP,
   1990), and a preliminary scheme for CH4, CO, and N2O reduction (Bach and
   Jain, 1992-1993).
   The required reduction depends, among others, on the desired climate and
   ecosystem protection. This is defined by the Enquete-Commission and
   others as a mean global rate of surface temperature change of ca.
   0.1-degrees-C per decade - assumed to be critical to many ecosystems -
   and a mean global warming ceiling of ca. 2-degrees-C in 2100 relative to
   1860.
   Our results show that the Copenhagen Agreements, the Tropical Forest
   Preservation Plan, the energy-related CO2 reduction scheme, and the CH,
   and N2O reduction schemes could mitigate the anthropogenic greenhouse
   warming by ca. 12\%, 6\%, 35\%, and 9\% respectively. Taken together,
   all four packages of measures could reduce the man-made greenhouse
   effect by more than 60\% until 2100; i.e. over the climate sensitivity
   range 2.5-degrees-C (1.5 to 4.5) for 2 x CO2, the warming could be
   reduced from 3.5-degrees-C (2.4 to 5.0) without specific measures to
   1.3-degrees-C (0.9 to 2.0) with the above packages of measures; and
   likewise, the mean global sea level rise could be reduced from 65 cm (46
   to 88) without specific measures to 32 cm (22 to 47) with the above
   measures.
   Finally, the model results also emphasize the importance of trace gases
   other than CO2 in mitigating additional man-made greenhouse warming.
   According to our preliminary estimates, CH4 could in the short term make
   a sizable contribution to the reduction of the greenhouse effect
   (because of its relatively short lifetime of 10 yr), as could N2O in the
   medium and long term (with a relatively long lifetime of 150 yr).},

Title = {COREDAR: A Coastal Climate Service Framework on Sea-Level Rise Risk
   Communication for Adaptation Policy Planning},
Booktitle = {HANDBOOK OF CLIMATE SERVICES},
Series = {Climate Change Management},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {85-104},
Abstract = {Accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) is a major long-term outcome of climate
   change leading to increased inundation of low-lying areas and put global
   cities and coastal communities at greater risk. Building capacities at
   the community level to address the challenges of SLR is an important
   first step towards adaptation policy planning and decision-making.
   Building capacity through risk communication is a bottleneck challenge
   to translate complex climate science into policy and actions. To meet
   these challenges, this paper has put forth the research question as what
   information do the coastal stakeholders need and how does it need to be
   communicated in the context of SLR and to build capacities that favor
   for effective SLR policy planning and decision-making at the local
   level. As a result, we have evolved COREDAR (COmmunicating Risk of
   sea-level rise and Engaging stakeholDers in framing community-based
   Adaptation strategies), a climate service capacity building framework
   that provides an important exploratory study, examining the SLR risk
   communications and community-based adaptation, extending and clarifying
   certain findings within the current SLR literature. The framework
   highlight the need to consider the relevance of addressing SLR risk
   communication in a systemic and holistic approach that integrates
   science, society, and policy in SLR research, whilst at the same time
   pointing to some interesting directions for engaging local communities
   in the decision-making process for framing adaptation strategies that
   are community-centric. Importantly, this framework emphasizes the
   significance of climate communication strategies and use of climate
   information in policy planning and decision-making as one of the
   potential climate services for SLR risk research.},

Title = {Resilient futures of a small island: A participatory approach in
   Tenerife (Canary Islands) to address climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {28-37},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change has been considered to be crucial to
   current societies, especially for small islands. In this paper the case
   of Tenerife (in the Canary Islands) is analysed. Tenerife is a small
   island located northwest of the African continent, in the Atlantic
   Ocean. Tenerife presents a high vulnerability to heatwaves and Saharan
   dust events as a consequence of its closeness to the Saharan desert. In
   fact, increasing frequency of heatwaves and Saharan dust events has been
   reported and could worsen in the future due to global warming. An
   exploration of adaptation strategies to an increase of the frequency and
   intensity of these phenomena is therefore needed. Different social
   actors have been engaged in a participatory process aiming at exploring
   pathways for adaptation to extreme weather events. Resilience was argued
   as the relevant framing to address those hazards. Four focus group
   sessions were carried out in order to explore key transformative
   elements necessary to make resilient futures for Tenerife. The results
   highlight the need for broader climate-based policies across all sectors
   to assure that the island becomes resilient to climatic and non-climatic
   shocks.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas network design using backward Lagrangian particle
   dispersion modelling - Part 2: Sensitivity analyses and South African
   test case},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2051-2069},
Abstract = {This is the second part of a two-part paper considering a measurement
   network design based on a stochastic Lagrangian particle dispersion
   model (LPDM) developed by Marek Uliasz, in this case for South Africa. A
   sensitivity analysis was performed for different specifications of the
   network design parameters which were applied to this South African test
   case. The LPDM, which can be used to derive the sensitivity matrix used
   in an atmospheric inversion, was run for each candidate station for the
   months of July (representative of the Southern Hemisphere winter) and
   January (summer). The network optimisation procedure was carried out
   under a standard set of conditions, similar to those applied to the
   Australian test case in Part 1, for both months and for the combined 2
   months, using the incremental optimisation (IO) routine. The optimal
   network design setup was subtly changed, one parameter at a time, and
   the optimisation routine was re-run under each set of modified
   conditions and compared to the original optimal network design. The
   assessment of the similarity between network solutions showed that
   changing the height of the surface grid cells, including an uncertainty
   estimate for the ocean fluxes, or increasing the night-time observation
   error uncertainty did not result in any significant changes in the
   positioning of the stations relative to the standard design. However,
   changing the prior flux error covariance matrix, or increasing the
   spatial resolution, did.
   Large aggregation errors were calculated for a number of candidate
   measurement sites using the resolution of the standard network design.
   Spatial resolution of the prior fluxes should be kept as close to the
   resolution of the transport model as the computing system can manage, to
   mitigate the exclusion of sites which could potentially be beneficial to
   the network. Including a generic correlation structure in the prior flux
   error covariance matrix led to pronounced changes in the network
   solution. The genetic algorithm (GA) was able to find a marginally
   better solution than the IO procedure, increasing uncertainty reduction
   by 0.3 \%, but still included the most influential stations from the
   standard network design. In addition, the computational cost of the GA
   compared to IO was much higher. Overall the results suggest that a good
   improvement in knowledge of South African fluxes is available from a
   feasible atmospheric network, and that the general features of this
   network are invariable under several reasonable choices in a network
   design study.},

Abstract = {Increasing frequency, intensity and duration of severe weather events
   are posing major challenges to global food security and livelihoods of
   rural people. Agriculture has evolved through adaptation to local
   circumstances for thousands of years. Local experience in responding to
   severe weather conditions, accumulated over generations and centuries,
   is valuable for developing adaptation options to current climate change.
   This study aimed to: (i) identify tree species that reduce vulnerability
   of cropping systems under climate variability; and (ii) develop a method
   for rapidly assessing vulnerability and exploring strategies of
   smallholder farmers in rural areas exposed to climate variability.
   Participatory Rural Appraisal methods in combination with Geographical
   Information Systems tools and statistical analysis of meteorological
   data were used to evaluate local vulnerability to climate change and to
   investigate local adaptation measures in two selected villages in
   Vietnam, one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. The low
   predictability of severe weather events makes food crops, especially
   grain production, insecure. This study shows that while rice and rain-
   fed crops suffered over 40 \% yield losses in years of extreme drought
   or flood, tree- based systems and cattle were less affected. 13 tree
   species performed well under the harsh local climate conditions in home
   and forest gardens to provide income, food, feed and other environmental
   benefits. Thus, this research suggests that maintenance and enhancement
   of locally evolved agroforestry systems, with high resilience and
   multiple benefits, can contribute to climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Is there room for geoengineering in the optimal climate policy mix?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {67-76},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We investigate geoengineering as a possible substitute for mitigation
   and adaptation measures to address climate change. Relying on an
   integrated assessment model, we distinguish between the effects of solar
   radiation management (SRM) on atmospheric temperature levels and its
   side-effects on the environment. The optimal climate portfolio is a mix
   of mitigation, adaptation, and SRM. When accounting for uncertainty in
   the magnitude of SRM side-effects and their persistency over time, we
   show that the SRM option lacks robustness. We then analyse the welfare
   consequences of basing the SRM decision on wrong assumptions about its
   side-effects, and show that total output losses are considerable and
   increase with the error horizon. This reinforces the need to balance the
   policy portfolio in favour of mitigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Flood risk and adaptation in Indian coastal cities: recent scenarios},
Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal cities contrive to spread their transformative influence both
   into the hinterland, along the coastline, and into the coastal waters
   themselves. These effects will be intensified in urban agglomerations as
   the concentration of population and allied activities are more
   pronounced there compared to the inland regions. Indian coastal cities
   are no exception, and it is high time to delineate these hazard-prone
   regions and implement proper mitigation and adaptation strategies at
   city scale. This review article provides an assessment regarding
   quantification, management and climate change impacts of flood risks in
   Surat, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, which are the most populated coastal
   cities in India. The flood impacts considered in the existing or
   prevailing analyses are associated with adverse effects on population,
   land use of cities, transportation and economy caused by different types
   of riverine and urban flooding, though coastal flooding, tsunami and
   storm surge effects are less studied. Mumbai and Kolkata are relatively
   progressive in the assessment of flood risks and adaptation. The present
   article also suggests strategies to evaluate the relative progress in
   the assessment of past and future risks and adaptation. We also discuss
   the mitigation and adaptation strategies considering the historical
   importance of these cities. We propose that the strategies should be
   implemented considering public opinion and should be initialized at the
   grass root level. Though it is technically difficult to re-plan the city
   structures in the current scenario, it is possible to adapt to and
   mitigate the effects of natural hazards through suitable planning and
   management with the integrated cooperation and involvement of citizens
   and government as well.},

Title = {Atlanta's urban heat island under extreme heat conditions and potential
   mitigation strategies},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI), together with summertime heat waves,
   foster's biophysical hazards such as heat stress, air pollution, and
   associated public health problems. Mitigation strategies such as
   increased vegetative cover and higher albedo surface materials have been
   proposed. Atlanta, Georgia, is often affected by extreme heat, and has
   recently been investigated to better understand its heat island and
   related weather modifications. The objectives of this research were to
   (1) characterize temporal variations in the magnitude of UHI around
   Metro Atlanta area, (2) identify climatological attributes of the UHI
   under extremely high temperature conditions during Atlanta's summer
   (June, July, and August) period, and (3) conduct theoretical numerical
   simulations to quantify the first-order effects of proposed mitigation
   strategies. Over the period 1984-2007, the climatological mean UHI
   magnitude for Atlanta-Athens and Athens-Monticello was 1.31 and 1.71A
   degrees C, respectively. There were statistically significant minimum
   temperature trends of 0.70A degrees C per decade at Athens and -1.79A
   degrees C per decade at Monticello while Atlanta's minimum temperature
   remained unchanged. The largest (smallest) UHI magnitudes were in spring
   (summer) and may be coupled to cloud-radiative cycles. Heat waves in
   Atlanta occurred during 50\% of the years spanning 1984-2007 and were
   exclusively summertime phenomena. The mean number of heat wave events in
   Atlanta during a given heat wave year was 1.83. On average, Atlanta heat
   waves lasted 14.18 days, although there was quite a bit of variability
   (standard deviation of 9.89). The mean maximum temperature during
   Atlanta's heat waves was 35.85A degrees C. The Atlanta-Athens UHI was
   not statistically larger during a heat wave although the
   Atlanta-Monticello UHI was. Model simulations captured daytime and
   nocturnal UHIs under heat wave conditions. Sensitivity results suggested
   that a 100\% increase in Atlanta's surface vegetation or a tripling of
   its albedo effectively reduced UHI surface temperature. However, from a
   mitigation and technological standpoint, there is low feasibility of
   tripling albedo in the foreseeable future. Increased vegetation seems to
   be a more likely choice for mitigating surface temperature.},

Title = {Visioning a framework for effective environmental management of deep-sea
   polymetallic nodule mining: Drivers, barriers, and enablers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {337},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining is expected to start within the next
   decade. There is currently a pressing need to develop best practices to
   minimise the potential environmental impacts of this new industry.
   Project specific environmental management processes, such as
   environmental impact assessment (EIA), and the associated environmental
   management and monitoring plan (EMMP), must be effective to sufficiently
   mitigate environmental impacts of deep-sea mining (DSM) projects. This
   paper identifies the key drivers, barriers, and enablers to polymetallic
   nodule mining from a review of recent literature and develops an
   environmental management framework prior to any exploitation licenses
   being approved. We explore how the drivers to polymetallic nodule mining
   are framed in a global context, including claims that it will facilitate
   clean energy transitions, increase mineral supply diversity, and improve
   life cycle sustainability. We highlight the key barriers to effective
   environmental management, including epistemic uncertainty about deep-sea
   ecosystems, assessment of harmful effects from mining activities, and
   stakeholder support for a social license. We identify three enablers,
   including the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach, and
   adaptive management, all of which are highly interdependent and must be
   operationalised to address the identified barriers. The results of this
   analysis indicate a complex social-ecological narrative infused
   throughout recent literature, emphasising the need for systems-level
   thinking and broader stakeholder participation. We present an
   environmental management framework designed to support good industry
   practice and guide future research.},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {This paper examines the vulnerabilities of agriculture in coastal
   regions of Bangladesh to the different adverse effects of sea level rise
   induced hazards, and also identifies option for future agricultural
   adaptations. It reveals that due to sea level rise, agriculture of the
   study area has already experienced noticeable adverse impacts especially
   in terms of area of inundation, salinity intrusion and reduction in crop
   production. The study is conducted based on both primary and secondary
   data. A total 303 out of 1200 respondents from three coastal villages
   were randomly interviewed. Samples are drawn proportionately from three
   villages. Descriptive and inferential statistics and logistic regression
   have been done to analysis data. The study find that the agricultural
   land, production of crops, local crop varieties, income and employment
   facilities of the farmers is highly vulnerable to various SLR induced
   hazards. Selection of various adaptive options such as control of saline
   water intrusion into agricultural land, coastal afforestation,
   cultivation of saline tolerant crops, homestead and floating gardening,
   embankment cropping and increase of income through alternative
   livelihoods are emerging need for sustainable coastal agricultural
   development. Therefore, this paper argues that further development and
   implementation of such adaptive measures could help to minimize
   vulnerabilities of agriculture in the long run.},

Title = {Evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies for a subtropical
   city centre (a case study in Osaka, Japan)},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {250},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) effects were first observed in London in the
   19th century. The urban heat island is identified by developing higher
   temperatures in urban areas than the surrounding rural areas that
   directly surround them. However, there are some main mitigation
   strategies to deal with subtropical UHI, such as increasing the albedo
   of the urban environment (reflective pavement) and developing the green
   infrastructure (green roof) in urban areas. This study would analyse the
   microclimate in a subtropical city by evaluating meteorological
   parameters with a three-dimensional model simulation software of
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) named ENVI-Met. To evaluate Urban
   Heat Island mitigation strategies for a Subtropical City Centre,
   subtropical city Osaka, Japan, is selected to investigate UHI with
   modelling. The simulation has been used to applicate the five scenarios
   (base scenario, cool pavement scenario, cool roof scenario, increasing
   vegetation coverage scenario, and integrated scenario) with different
   albedo and vegetation coverage ratios. In this study, outdoor air
   temperature, sky view factor, net radiation, mean radiant temperature
   and thermal radiative power are considered as five criteria for
   evaluating the efficiency of UHI mitigation strategies. The simulation
   results of the base model (scenario A) with Osaka's current condition
   are considered the reference value. The relative percentage differences
   between each scenario with a base model are determined. The increased
   albedo of urban fabric material (scenario B Cool pavement model) showed
   the most efficient to mitigate UHI. The relative percentage differences
   of the five criteria in the Cool pavement model are more significant
   than other models. Therefore, the results of this study can provide
   valuable guidance, both for keeping subtropical residents cooler and
   informing subtropical climate cities that would be sustainable in the
   future.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Accelerating Urban Heating Under Land-Cover and Climate Change Scenarios
   in Indonesia: Application of the Universal Thermal Climate Index},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Climate change causing an increase of frequency and magnitude of heat
   waves has a huge impact on the urban population worldwide. In Indonesia,
   the Southeast Asian country in the tropical climate zone, the increasing
   heat wave duration due to climate change will be also magnified by
   projected rapid urbanization. Therefore, not only climate change
   mitigation measures but also adaptation solutions to more frequent
   extreme weather events are necessary. Adaptation is essential at local
   levels. The projected increase of the heat wave duration will trigger
   greater health-related risks. It will also drive higher energy demands,
   particularly in urban areas, for cooling. New smart solutions for
   growing urbanization for reducing urban heat island phenomenon are
   critical, but in order to identify them, analyzing the changing
   magnitude and spatial distribution of urban heat is essential. We
   projected the current and future spatial variability of heat stress
   index in three cities in Indonesia, namely, Medan, Surabaya, and
   Denpasar, under climate change and land-cover change scenarios, and
   quantified it with the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) for two
   periods, baseline (1981-2005) and future (2018-2042). Our results
   demonstrated that currently the higher level of the UTCI was identified
   in the urban centers of all three cities, indicating the contribution of
   urban heat island phenomenon to the higher UTCI. Under climate change
   scenarios, all three cities will experience increase of the heat,
   whereas applying the land-cover scenario demonstrated that in only Medan
   and Denpasar, the UTCI is likely to experience a higher increase by 3.1
   degrees C; however, in Surabaya, the UTCI will experience 0.84 degrees C
   decrease in the period 2018-2042 due to urban greening. This study
   advanced the UTCI methodology by demonstrating its applicability for
   urban heat warning systems and for monitoring of the urban green cooling
   effect, as well as it provides a base for adaptation measures' planning.},

Title = {A systematic analysis of enabling conditions for synergy between climate
   change mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {138-148},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is a growing quest for synergy between mitigation and adaptation
   due to concerns of inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the
   compartmentalized approaches to climate change. However, little has been
   done to explore the necessary enabling conditions for synergistic design
   and implementation. This paper proposes an analytical framework to
   assess enabling conditions for synergies at the national level and
   applies it to developing countries to explore the potential move toward
   synergy. Four enabling conditions for integrating adaptation and
   mitigation, i.e. policies and strategies, programs and projects,
   institutional arrangements and financial mechanisms, were used to score
   developing countries relative to each other. We hypothesized that low
   income and vulnerable countries might more likely pursue synergy given
   the urgency for both adaptation and mitigation. Despite the relative
   infancy of the synergy concept, about half of countries studied
   exhibited good synergy potential, 80\% of which were middle-income
   developing countries. The assumption of vulnerability as a precursor for
   pursuing synergy was supported by the fact that small island states
   possessed relatively high synergy potential. Income was weakly
   associated with the synergy potential with least developed countries
   having low synergy scores. Emerging economies possessed strong synergy
   potential which might be associated with better capacity available
   and/or potential for shaping their global images due to their growing
   emissions. In sum, the proposed analytical framework could be useful to
   identify areas of emphasis to promote holistic and efficient climate
   policies. As this study largely focused on the enabling conditions,
   further studies are needed to scrutinize and manage the
   mitigation-adaptation balances in countries possessing good synergy
   potentials. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Climate change is facilitating a novel range expansion of southern pine
   beetle (SPB) into globally rare north-eastern pitch pine barrens. By
   assessing stand conditions present in SPB-infested and uninfested pitch
   pine stands on Long Island, NY, USA, we developed a
   regionally-calibrated hazard rating model that predicts stand-level SPB
   susceptibility. The model indicates that a stand's SPB susceptibility
   increases with (1) increasing pitch pine basal area, (2) increasing
   instances of previous year SPB spots nearby, and (3) sandy soil texture.
   The model informs adaptation strategies to a novel pest dynamic by
   supporting the identification and prioritization of high hazard stands
   for prevention management. An alignment between treatments effective in
   reducing SPB vulnerability and conserving pine barrens communities
   indicates that pine barrens can be managed both to improve resilience to
   future threats and preserve historic ecological conditions.},

Abstract = {Tourism in island states is vulnerable to climate change because it may
   result in detrimental changes in relation to extreme events, sea level
   rise, transport and Communication interruption. This study analyses
   adaptation to climate change by tourist resorts in Fiji, as well as
   their potential to reduce climate change through reductions ill carbon
   dioxide emissions. Interviews, site visitations, and an accommodation
   survey were undertaken. Many operators already prepare for
   climate-related events and therefore adapt to potential impacts
   resulting from climate change. Reducing emissions is not important to
   operators; however, decreasing energy costs for economic reasons is
   practised. Recommendations for further initiatives are made and
   synergies between the adaptation and mitigation approaches are explored.

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Volume = {83},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1257-1278},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Deltas are the promising places with multifarious ecosystems and arable
   soils along with the ease of water transportation system; hence, a
   number of important cities are established in or near coastal delta
   regions. However, due to the geomorphic characteristics, those cities
   are extremely exposed to hydro-meteorological hazards, especially to
   riverine and coastal flood. Additionally, climate change, rapid
   urbanization and subsidence are exacerbating the existing situation and
   causing monumental loss. Researchers as well as various international
   organizations like United Nations Inter-Agency Secretariat of the
   International Strategy for Disaster Reduction have recognized the
   implications of formulating disaster risk reduction (DRR) plans for
   coastal delta cities. This demands for the excogitation of adaptation
   policies and measures in addition to the mitigation efforts to reduce
   flood risks. In this regard, to support the comprehensive concept
   development, this study elicits different components of flood risk
   reduction policies and measures, congenial for coastal delta cities in
   respect of physical and environmental perspectives. Eleven precedent
   (model) cities are selected to study their various initiatives for
   reducing coastal flood risks. Findings show that protecting cities from
   flooding and reducing exposure to floods are two different but
   interrelated approaches of DRR. Combinations of structural and
   non-structural measures are the prerequisites to achieve the goal of
   effective DRR.},

Title = {Influences of Climate Change and Variability on Estuarine Ecosystems: An
   Impact Study in Selected European, South American and Asian Countries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is well-known that climate change significantly impacts ecosystems
   (at the macro-level) and individual species (at the micro-level). Among
   the former, estuaries are the most vulnerable and affected ecosystems.
   However, despite the strong relations between climate change and
   estuaries, there is a gap in the literature regarding international
   studies across different regions investigating the impacts of climate
   change and variability on estuaries in different geographical zones.
   This paper addresses this need and reviews the impacts of climate
   change, variability and extreme weather on estuaries. It emphasises the
   following: (i) a set of climate parameters governing estuarine hydrology
   and processes; and (ii) a sample of countries in Asia (Bangladesh),
   Europe (Portugal) and South America (Uruguay). We reviewed the
   influences of the climatic drivers of the estuarine hydrology,
   ecological processes and specific species in estuarine communities
   across the selected geographical regions, along with an analysis of
   their long-term implications. The key results from the three estuaries
   are as following: (i) Hilsa fish, of which the catches contribute to
   10\% of the total earnings of the fishery sector (1\% of GDP), are
   affected by climate-forced hydrological and productivity changes in the
   Meghna; (ii) extreme droughts and short-term severe precipitation have
   driven the long-term abundance and spatial distribution of both fish
   larvae and juveniles/adults in the Mondego; and (iii) the river inflow
   and fluctuations increases since the early 1970s have contributed to
   variations in the salinity, the stratification, the oxygen, nutrient and
   trophic levels and the spatial pattern for the life stages of planktonic
   species, fish biomass and captures in the Rio de la Plata. The results
   suggested that immediate action is needed to reduce the vulnerability of
   estuaries to climate stressors, mainly the changing river flows, storms
   and sea-level rise. As a contribution to addressing current problems, we
   described a set of adaptation strategies to foster climate resilience
   and adaptive capacity (e.g., early-warning systems, dam management to
   prevent overflows and adaptive fisheries management). The implications
   of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, it showcases a variety of problems
   that estuaries face from changing climate conditions. Secondly, the
   paper outlines the need for suitable adaptive management strategies to
   safeguard the integrity of such vital ecosystems.},

Abstract = {To meet the demand for food from a growing global population,
   aquaculture production is under great pressure to increase as capture
   fisheries have stagnated. However, aquaculture has raised a range of
   environmental concerns, and further increases in aquaculture production
   will face widespread environmental challenges. The effects of climate
   change will pose a further threat to global aquaculture production.
   Aquaculture is often at risk from a combination of climatic variables,
   including cyclone, drought, flood, global warming, ocean acidification,
   rainfall variation, salinity, and sea level rise. For aquaculture growth
   to be sustainable its environmental impacts must reduce significantly.
   Adaptation to climate change is also needed to produce more fish without
   environmental impacts. Some adaptation strategies including integrated
   aquaculture, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), and the expansion
   of seafood farming could increase aquaculture productivity,
   environmental sustainability, and climate change adaptability.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The North faces significant health disparities, especially among its
   many Indigenous peoples. In this article we discuss historical,
   environmental, and cultural variables that contribute to these
   disparities and propose a One Health approach to address them in a
   holistic and culturally appropriate manner. The One Health paradigm
   recognizes the interdependence among the health and well-being of
   people, animals and the environment. As such, the framework aligns well
   with many Indigenous world views. This proactive, interdisciplinary,
   constructivist, and collaborative approach promise earlier detection of
   risks and threats, as well as more effective responses, in part by
   engaging community level stakeholders in all stages of the process. In
   the far North, humans, especially Indigenous peoples, continue to live
   closely connected to their environment, in settings that exert
   significant impacts on health. In recent decades, rapid warming and
   elevated contaminant levels have heightened environmental risks and
   increased uncertainty, both of which threaten individual and community
   health and well-being. Under these circumstances especially, One
   Health's comprehensive approach may provide mitigating and adaptive
   strategies to enhance resilience. While many of the examples used in
   this manuscript focus on Alaska and Canada, the authors believe similar
   conditions exist among the indigenous and rural residents across the
   entire Circumpolar North.},

Title = {Coastal climate adaptation planning and evolutionary governance:
   Insights from Homer, Alaska},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate variability is not a new challenge for coastal communities.
   However, because climate variability is manifesting with more extreme
   climate impacts, occurring with greater frequency and with more
   intensity, the necessity for adaptation to minimize risk is becoming
   more pronounced. Though this is true of coastal communities around the
   globe, it is an acutely important concern for coastal communities in
   high northern latitudes, where the impacts of climate change are
   occurring at a disproportionate rate. With Homer, Alaska, as a case
   study, and through the lens of evolutionary governance, this research
   investigates coastal stressors (eg. storm surges, bluff instability) and
   subsequent decision dynamics around local government policy and planning
   for climate adaptation. In particular, the paper explores the
   relationship between actors and institutions, the connection between
   power and knowledge, as well as the challenges of path and goal
   dependencies. Narratives from key informants associated with Homer's
   climate change agenda highlight that while some stakeholders are keen to
   mainstream adaptation thinking into long-term strategic planning,
   adaptation policy remains a low priority (with a focus instead on
   mitigation). Uptake is further hindered by a belief among key
   decision-makers that the threat of climate change is a concern for the
   future. This in turn has resulted in diminished internal capacity (eg.
   institutions, knowledge) to effectively prepare for climate variability
   in general. Drawing insights through evolutionary governance theory,
   this study may provide coastal community decision-makers with an
   appreciation of the value (and nuanced challenges) of embedding climate
   adaptation thinking into strategic community planning.},

Abstract = {Due to the ongoing global warming, heat mitigation strategies are
   becoming implemented through practice and simulations. These efforts aim
   to make the cities that are dealing with the urban heat island more
   livable. The effect of heat mitigation strategies on climate
   320condition and energy consumption have been studied and compared,
   previously. In this paper, the effect of these strategies on human
   thermal comfort in urban open spaces is reviewed. Specifically, the
   review is focused on vegetation (in the form of parks, street trees,
   green roofs and green walls), and highly reflective materials (on roof
   and on the ground level) as the most common strategies for improving the
   thermal conditions in cities. Several studies done by simulation or
   through field measurement in different countries are described. The most
   important finding of the review is the fact that although highly
   reflective materials reduce air temperature in urban open spaces, they
   increase the re-radiation of sun to the pedestrians. Therefore,
   vegetation is a better choice for improving thermal comfort in the
   pedestrian level.},

Abstract = {Convincing people that climate change is potentially as important as
   other problems in the region such as poverty, conflict, and corruption,
   is a significant challenge for climate change adaptation strategies.
   Many experts attribute the receding shorelines and apparent rise in sea
   levels around Pacific island countries to climate change. It is
   questionable whether ordinary people are making similar connections.
   Raising the level of concern about climate change is essential if this
   is to change. This paper argues that civil society, in the form of
   non-government organisations (NGOs), offers a very effective means for
   creating this change. Non-government organisations work closely with
   local communities, and can use this relationship to communicate the need
   to give urgent attention to climate change issues. NGOs also have access
   to policy makers, including government, which they can use to help align
   policies with community priorities.},

Journal = {MARITIME STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal cities in parts of Indonesia are subject to many compounding
   pressures, including increasing population and industrial agglomeration,
   and are experiencing greater levels of relative sea level rise (SLR)
   given the impacts of climate change and large-scale subsidence. The
   sustainability and resilience of many coastal cities is being tested as
   they struggle to integrate many socio-technical, political and
   ecological dependencies within the city with the surrounding coastal
   environment. Governments at all levels have implemented a diversity of
   strategies to arrest relative sea level rise, but given the `wicked'
   nature of this problem, both policy solutions, proposed and implemented,
   have rarely achieved the outcomes needed. To a large extent, this is
   attributed to the ineffective governance framework which has led to
   policy failure, with multiple actors being motivated by different
   legislative, political, financial and social interests who prioritize
   specific beneficiaries and solutions. This article examines the
   governance challenges associated with sea level rise through case
   studies in Semarang and Demak, Indonesia. It highlights significant
   barriers that impede effective coastal adaptation including (1) the
   policy and motivations of differing levels of government. This includes
   a national government that emphasizes mega-infrastructure projects, a
   regional government that lacks the capacity and resources to address
   groundwater extraction and a local government that seeks low-cost hybrid
   engineering solutions given their financial and budgetary constraints;
   and (2) ipso facto a lack of coordination across scale, jurisdiction and
   sectors. This article also highlights several opportunities for
   community and civil society participation in nature-based solution (NBS)
   practices and implementation. This article finds that effective
   adaptation strategies in coastal areas require an integrated governance
   framework to improve policy implementation and coordination.},

   for Changing Oceans and Resilient Ecosystems by 2030 (FishSCORE), a

   assess and operationalize climate resilience in marine fisheries and (2)
   local and regional partnerships that will apply those tools to identify
   and forward context-specific resilience strategies. FishSCORE's
   activities will be guided by a set of core principles that include
   commitments to inclusivity, equity, co-leadership, co-ownership, and
   reciprocity. FishSCORE will focus on identifying solutions for climate
   resilient fisheries, and it will also advance goals associated with
   capacity, power, and agency that will support iterative, pluralistic
   approaches to decision-making in fisheries experiencing ongoing
   climate-driven changes. This process of co-producing knowledge and
   strategies requires considerable investments of time from all partners,
   which is well aligned with the Ocean Decade. However, secure funding

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Peripheral communities across the Pacific are progressively being
   recognized as priority areas for the implementation of climate change
   adaptation strategies. A key step in planning and implementing effective
   adaptation actions is to identify what elements are driving
   vulnerability and resilience. Building on existing vulnerability and
   resilience conceptual models, we developed and applied a conceptual
   framework to identify drivers of vulnerability and resilience in
   social-ecological systems. By unifying the two concepts of vulnerability
   and resilience into a single framework, it is possible to better capture
   drivers of coping, adaptive and transformative capacities, and how they
   relate to specific climate hazards. The aim of the framework is to
   provide the conceptual basis from which the two concepts can be applied
   in conjunction, rather than prescribing specific indicators. The
   proposed framework was applied using a participatory action research
   approach to identify drivers of resilience and vulnerability in three
   coastal villages on a peripheral rural island in Fiji. Results from the
   framework's application show that these communities are currently
   contextualized within multiple layers of vulnerability and resilience,
   driven by: dependency on external support to implement activities, lack
   of knowledge about novel management actions for dealing with rapid
   environmental change, high levels of agency, increased access to support
   and services, high levels of awareness about climate change impacts,
   disposition to implement change and learn, and capacity to mobilize
   community resources and support. The development and application of the
   framework highlights aspects of vulnerability and resilience that have
   been overlooked or undervalued in the past when designing and
   implementing strategies for climate change adaptation in small island
   developing states (SIDS). The proposed framework has the potential to
   help overcome existing barriers in designing and implementing successful
   adaptation strategies, optimizing their effectiveness and sustainability
   in ways that are aligned with the unique situations of many SIDS.},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation planning requires the integration of
   disciplines, stakeholders, different modelling approaches, treatment
   options, and scales of analysis. An integrated stepwise planning
   approach is a critical requirement for effective climate change
   adaptation in the context of small island developing states and coastal
   communities. To address this need, this paper reports on a systematic
   review of 116 research papers from an initial set of around 650 academic
   peer-reviewed papers. These papers were assessed and categorised based
   on their planning framework or the approach utilised, measured climate
   change impacts, employed methods and tools, and recommended adaptation
   strategies or options. This study identified three important dimensions
   of a fully integrated climate change adaptation planning process,
   namely, integration in assessment, integration in modelling, and
   integration in adaptive responses. Moreover, it resulted in the
   formulation of a novel multi-layered integrative climate change
   adaptation planning approach. Adopting this holistic and integrative
   approach is more likely to yield better climate change adaptation in
   planning outcomes over the long term.},

Title = {Discrete Pulses of Cooler Deep Water Can Decelerate Coral Bleaching
   During Thermal Stress: Implications for Artificial Upwelling During Heat
   Stress Events},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Global warming is considered to be the most severe threat to coral reefs
   globally, which makes it important for scientists to develop novel
   strategies that mitigate the impact of warming on corals and associated
   habitats. Artificial upwelling of cooler deep water to the surface layer
   may be a possible mitigation/management tool. In this study, we
   investigated the effect of simulated artificial upwelling with deep
   water off Bermuda collected at 50 m (24 degrees C) and 100 m (20 degrees
   C) on coral symbiont biology of 3 coral species (Montastrea cavernosa,
   Porites astreoides, and Pseudodiploria strigosa) in a temperature stress
   experiment. The following treatments were applied over a period of 3
   weeks: (i) control at 28 degrees C (ii) heat at 31 degrees C, (iii) heat
   at 31 degrees C+ deep water from 50 m depth, and (iv) heat at 31 degrees
   C+ deep water from 100 m depth. Artificial upwelling was simulated over
   a period of 25 min on a daily basis resulting in a reduction of
   temperature for 2 h per day and the following degree-heating-weeks: 5.7
   degrees C-weeks for ii, 4.6 degrees C-weeks for iii and 4.2 degrees
   C-weeks for iv. Comparative analysis of photosynthetic rate,
   chlorophyll-a concentration and zooxanthellae density revealed a
   reduction of heat stress responses in artificial upwelling treatments in
   2 of the 3 investigated species, and a stronger positive effect of 100-m
   water than 50-m water. These results indicate that artificial upwelling
   could be an effective strategy to mitigate coral bleaching during heat
   stress events allowing corals to adjust to increasing temperatures more
   gradually. It will still be necessary to further explore the ecological
   benefits as well as potential ecosystem impacts associated with
   different artificial upwelling scenarios to carefully implement an
   effective in situ artificial upwelling strategy in coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Urbanization, land subsidence and sea level rise will increase
   vulnerability of the urbanized low-lying areas in the western part of
   the Netherlands. In this article possibilities are explored to reduce
   vulnerability of these areas by implementing alternative water
   management options. Two main water management fields are distinguished,
   water supply and flood control. A four-component vulnerability framework
   is presented that includes threshold capacity, coping capacity, recovery
   capacity, and adaptive capacity. By using the vulnerability framework it
   is shown that current water supply and flood control strategies in the
   Netherlands focus on increasing threshold capacity by constructing
   higher and stronger dikes, improved water storage and delivery
   infrastructure. A complete vulnerability decreasing strategy requires
   measures that include all four capacities. Flood damage reduction,
   backup water supply systems and emergency plans are measures that can
   contribute to increasing coping capacity. Recovery capacity can be
   increased by multi-source water supply, insurance, or establishing
   disaster funds. Adaptive capacity can be developed by starting
   experiments with new modes of water supply and urbanization. Including
   all four components of the vulnerability framework enables better
   understanding of water and climate related vulnerability of urban areas
   and enables developing more complete water management strategies to
   reduce vulnerability.},

Abstract = {The severity of climatic changes threatening urban coastal areas is
   introducing and intensifying environmental hazards that are endangering
   physical safety and livelihood security. This paper considers retreat,
   one of three broad adaptation options proposed by the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change, as a possible climate change adaptation
   strategy for low-income communities in less developed nations.
   Resettlement as climate change adaptation is a developing concept, with
   minimal guidelines and academic literature on the topic. Thus, this
   review expands beyond climate change, considering three literature
   themes surrounding resettlement: (1) climate change, (2) hazard and
   natural disasters (i.e. floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes), and (3)
   economic development (i.e. dam construction and natural resource
   extraction). The review extracts successful resettlement planning and
   approaches, as well as the lessons learned, to identify five principles
   for resettlement in a climate change context: Proactivity, Communication
   and Participation, Permanence, Compensation, and Livelihood Protection.
   The results of the analysis suggest five principles that can be used as
   a guideline for implementing resettlement as climate change adaptation
   for low-income and informal communities in less developed nations.
   Ultimately, these recommendations can be used to assess the
   appropriateness and feasibility of employing resettlement as managed
   retreat in less developed nations.},

Abstract = {This paper explores some of the perverse effects of climate change
   adaptation policies and financing in the Republic of Kiribati, a
   low-lying island nation in the Central Pacific. I examine how encounters

   to climate change. I draw throughout from field research conducted in
   Kiribati, an archetypical `vulnerable-to-climate-change' place, and a
   preeminent site for experimentation in climate change adaptation. By
   discussing several instances where Government of Kiribati elites are
   required to enact vulnerability in order to secure climate change
   adaptation financing, I demonstrate that such encounters are
   performative. This research contributes to theories of performativity in
   showing that the matrix conditioning and compelling such performative
   enactments of vulnerability is socionatural, consisting of a collective
   of climate change impacts, adaptation-finance technocrats, and many
   others. Thus, I demonstrate that vulnerability is not a latent
   condition, but, rather, an emergent effect of an assemblage of facts,

Title = {Resilience and coastal governance: knowledge and navigation between
   stability and transformation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Several intergovernmental agreements highlight the need for resilience
   in the face of environmental and societal challenges. Coastal systems
   are particularly complex and susceptible to global climate change, and
   building human resilience to future changes is of high priority. While
   the concept of resilience has historically been associated with
   stability to perturbations, the notion of transformation within the
   social-ecological resilience (SER) approach has recently gained
   importance in ecosystem management. In order to operationalize
   resilience in the context of coastal governance in a changing climate, a
   better understanding of the concept is required. This paper provides an
   overview of different approaches to resilience, including stability and
   transformation, in order to understand resilience as a concept in a
   coastal governance context. Subsequently, we propose five steps and
   three types of knowledge (system, target, transformative) with which to
   embed SER in coastal governance. In addition, we consider scale and
   system boundaries; identify (un)desirable system characteristics and the
   role of normative goals and common visions in resilience management.
   Finally, we highlight the central role that local actors and information
   services play in fostering a two-way exchange between science and
   society and tailoring solutions for establishing or enhancing SER to the
   needs of local actors. We conclude that the navigation between stability
   and transformation within the concept of resilience is central to
   finding sustainable future pathways in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {As indicated by the Strategic Plan of Adaptation to Climate Change in
   Poland (SPA 2020), sectors sensitive to the impact of climate change are
   ``water management{''} and ``spatial economy and urbanized areas{''}.
   Cities are directly threatened by three phenomena: the intensification
   of the urban heat island, heavy downpours causing flooding, and drought,
   which is conducive to water deficit in cities. The aims of this study
   are: (1) a comparative analysis of the impact of climate change on water
   management - in Poland and other EU countries, (2) an analysis of the
   public water supply level in Poland and EU countries, (3) an assessment
   of the involvement of Polish cities in adapting to the climate to other
   EU countries - a comparative analysis of the Eurostat index ``Population
   covered by the Covenant of Mayors for Climate \& Energy{''}, and (4) an
   evaluation of how the adaptive policy has been implemented in the field
   of water management in Polish cities - a survey carried out among the
   cities in the project ``Let's feel the climate!{''}.},

Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is strictly related to climate
   changes and urban development. During summer, in urban areas, the lack
   of green zones and water sources causes local overheating, with
   discomfort and negative effects on buildings' energy performance.
   Starting from this, an experimental and numerical investigating of the
   climatic conditions in a university area in Rome was achieved, also
   assessing the occurrence of the UHI phenomenon. The analyzed area was
   recently renewed, with solutions in contrast to each other: on one side,
   an old building was re-designed aiming at high performance; on the other
   hand, the neighboring areas were also refurbished leading to large paved
   surfaces, characterized by high temperatures during summer. A calibrated
   numerical model was generated through ENVI-met software and eight
   different scenarios were compared, to mitigate the overheating of this
   area and to analyze the influences of the proposed solutions in terms of
   air temperature reduction. The analysis of this case study provides
   information on potential mitigation solutions in the urban environment,
   showing that goals and priorities in the design phase should concern not
   only buildings but also external areas, also considering university
   areas.},

   climate change for wetland policy and management, and identified
   potential adaptation responses and the information needed to support
   these. First, we considered wetland vulnerability to climate change,
   focusing on wetland exposure and sensitivity. We then outlined the
   existing policy context for dealing with climate change, with an
   emphasis on the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. We then considered how
   the objectives and targets for wetland management can be set in the face
   of climate change, how management can be adapted to climate change given
   the uncertainties involved, and how we can monitor and evaluate wetland
   condition in the face of climate change. We concluded with a set of
   principles to guide adaptation of wetland conservation and management
   policy to climate change.},

Title = {Using qualitative scenarios to understand regional environmental change
   in the Canadian North},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {1095-1108},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the application of qualitative scenarios to
   understand community vulnerability and adaptation responses, based on a
   case study in the Slave River Delta region of the Northwest Territories,
   Canada. Three qualitative, graphic scenarios of possible alternative
   futures were developed, focusing on two main drivers: climate change and
   resource development. These were used as a focal point for discussions
   with a cross-section of residents from the community during focus
   groups, interviews and a community workshop. Significant overlap among
   the areas of perceived vulnerability is evident among scenarios,
   particularly in relation to traditional land use. However, each scenario
   also offers insights about specific challenges facing community members.
   Climate change was perceived to engender mostly negative livelihood
   impacts, whereas resource development was expected to trigger a mix of
   positive and negative impacts, both of which may be more dramatic than
   in the ``climate change only{''} scenario. The scenarios were also used
   to identify adaptation options specific to individual drivers of change,
   as well as more universally applicable options. Identified adaptation
   options were generally aligned with five sectors-environment and natural
   resources, economy, community management and development, infrastructure
   and services, and information and training-which effectively offer a
   first step towards prioritization of ``no regrets{''} measures. From an
   empirical perspective, while the scenarios highlighted the need for
   bottom-up measures, they also elucidated discussion about local agency
   in adaptation and enabled the examination of multi-dimensional impacts
   on different community sub-groups. An incongruity emerged between the
   suite of technically oriented adaptation options and more socially and
   behaviourally oriented barriers to implementation. Methodologically, the
   qualitative scenarios were flexible, socially inclusive and consistent
   with the Indigenous worldview; allowed the incorporation of different
   knowledge systems; addressed future community vulnerability and
   adaptation; and led to the identification of socially feasible and
   bottom-up adaptation outcomes. Despite some caveats regarding resource
   requirements for participatory scenario development, qualitative
   scenarios offer a versatile tool to address a range of vulnerability and
   adaptation issues in the context of other Indigenous communities.},

Title = {Smallholder farmer coping and adaptation strategies during the 2015-18
   drought in the Western Cape, South Africa},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Smallholder farmers are vulnerable and hardest hit by droughts in
   Africa. One of the main causes of the increased vulnerability is limited
   access to resources resulting in limited drought preparedness. The
   heterogeneous nature of smallholder farmers means that they deal with
   droughts differently. Responses to drought are context-specific
   depending on the socio-economic, political, and cultural dimensions,
   which make it difficult to generalize. However, information on
   smallholder farmer drought perceptions, impacts on livelihoods, and the
   way droughts are dealt with at farm-level is scarce and mostly
   site-specific. This paper presents the findings from a study conducted
   in the Western Cape Province, in South Africa. The main objective of the
   study was to assess the impacts of the 2015-18 drought on the
   smallholder farmer livelihoods, and the coping and adaptation strategies
   adopted. The Sustainable Livelihoods Approach was used to frame
   questions on the coping mechanisms used by farmers, and any other
   strategies developed to adapt to future droughts. The study adopted the
   qualitative research design and focused on 112 smallholder farmers in
   two districts. Face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions were
   used to collect data, which was analysed using Atlas. ti 8.1 for
   Windows. The results showed that ownership of assets and support from
   private and public organisations facilitates better coping and
   adaptation to drought. There were social networks in farmer groups, but
   their benefits did not go beyond the members. Further research is
   required to determine the best models of support to smallholder farmers
   to empower them for adaption to future droughts.},

Title = {Coastal areas and climate change: A decision support tool for
   implementing adaptation measures},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change will be one of the main global challenges in the future.
   In this context cities play a key role. If, on the one hand, cities
   cause climate change, on the other hand, they are the places where
   climate change impacts are most evident, as it deeply affects the
   quality of life of its inhabitants. Climate change impacts are
   particularly relevant for coastal areas. These are characterized by a
   higher concentration of buildings and people in comparison to inland
   areas. In particular, one of the forecasted effects of climate change in
   these areas is the increase in coastal flooding due to rising sea levels
   and storm surges. The implementation of strategies and actions for the
   adaptation of urban areas to the impacts of coastal flooding is
   essential to ensure the liveability of coastal communities. Urban
   planning plays a key role in cities' adaptation. However, even though
   the interest in this topic has been increasing, operative support and
   tools for planning urban adaptation in cities are in short supply,
   especially in coastal cities. In light of this, it has become necessary
   to focus on the definition of new tools responding to the needs of urban
   planning.
   Based on these observations, this paper, starting from the existing
   literature on coastal vulnerability indices, has developed a new index:
   the Coastal Resilience Index (CoRI). Thanks to the CoRI and to the use
   of technological innovations applied to urban planning (in particular,
   Geographic Information Systems), a decision support tool has been
   developed to identify adaptation measures aiming to reduce the impacts
   of coastal flooding, caused by rising sea levels and storm surges.},

Pages = {56-63},
Abstract = {With the growing concerns on the impacts of climate change, one entry
   point identified for adaptation is through disaster risk management,
   specifically climate risks reduction. A greater number of national and
   local projects in the Philippines are now into mainstreaming of disaster
   risk reduction into development planning, land use planning, sectoral
   planning including that of agriculture, water resources, coastal zone
   management and in education. In this paper, one initiative of local
   government unit (LGU) and the local community is presented, specifically
   on the efforts of the provincial government of Bulacan on
   community-basedflood early warning and mitigation through exchange of
   information, in cooperation with the technical information provider.

Abstract = {Intensified storm-surge and sea-level rise due to global warming are
   typical manifestations of climate change. Consequently, coastal lowlands
   are becoming more vulnerable to the risk of coastal inundation and,
   therefore, mitigation of natural hazard is of utmost importance. The
   Nile Delta is vulnerable to the impact of storm-surge and sealevel rise,
   in particular the lower delta due to its relatively low elevation. This
   paper presents observations and hydrodynamic simulation of surge levels
   in the Mediterranean Sea offshore the delta during a severe storm on
   December 2010. The results indicate a higher surge (nearly 1 m) compared
   to the typical surge values (0.40.5m) observed previously offshore the
   delta. Fortunately, many of the consequences can be mitigated by taking
   measures against natural coastal risk. Adaptation measures could be
   implemented within the context of coastal zone management.},

Abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated the sensitivities of crop yield to a
   changing climate, a major challenge for the agricultural research
   community is to relate these findings to the wider societal concern with
   food security. Apart from few exceptions, the likely impacts of climate
   change on agricultural sector in the future are not understood in any
   great depth. There are many concerns as to how changes in temperature,
   rainfall and atmospheric Carbon Dioxide concentrations will interact in
   relation to agricultural productivity. The present article is an attempt
   to distil about the likely effects of climate change on food security
   and nutrition in coming decades. The consequences of climate change on
   various important aspects of agriculture are discussed and summarized.
   The article also discusses the analysis on the possible mitigation
   measures and adaptations for agriculture production in the future
   climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {This article reflects upon the experiences of testing the
   Resilience-Increasing Strategies for Coasts - toolKIT (RISC-KIT), an
   integrated approach composed of five different methodologies, in the

   highlight both the importance and complexities of integrated approaches
   in coastal management. The experiences documented through the case of
   Kristianstad highlight the benefits of combining hazard estimations and
   participatory approaches to understand risk, impacts of coastal hazards,
   and potential solutions; and the challenges of mainstreaming risk
   assessment approaches across contexts. We argue that integrated
   approaches can be effective for triggering local dialogue, disseminating
   information, and achieve greater ownership and local acceptance of
   Disaster Risk Reduction measures, but that involvement of local actors
   requires careful design and planning. The experiences documented when
   pilot-testing RISC-KITS integrated approach argue for increased
   co-production of knowledge in coastal management projects.},

Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {429-439},
Abstract = {So as to assess how emerging science and new tools can be applied to
   study multiple stressors at a large (ecosystem) scale and to facilitate
   greater integration of approaches among different scientific
   disciplines, a workshop was organised on 10-12 September 2014 at the
   Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences, Sydney, Australia. The present
   paper discusses the limitations of the current risk-assessment
   approaches and how multiple stressors at large scales can be better
   evaluated in ecological risk assessments to inform the development of
   more efficient and preventive management policies based on adaptive
   management in the future. A future risk-assessment paradigm that
   overcomes these limitations is presented. This paradigm includes
   cultural and ecological protection goals, the development of ecological
   scenarios, the establishment of the relevant interactions among species,
   potential sources of stressors, their interactions and the development
   of cause-effect models. It is envisaged that this will be achievable
   through a greater integration of approaches among different scientific
   disciplines and through the application of new and emerging tools such
   as `big data', ecological modelling and the incorporation of ecosystem
   service endpoints.},

Title = {A Hybrid Process to Address Uncertainty and Changing Climate Risk in

   Decision Analysis \& Real Options Analysis: A New Zealand Application},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Decision makers face challenges in coastal areas about how to address
   the effects of ongoing and uncertain sea-level rise. Dynamic adaptive
   pathways planning (DAPP) and Real Options Analysis (ROA) can support
   decision makers to address irreducible uncertainties in coastal areas.
   This paper sets out what we learned by complementing multi-criteria
   decision analysis with DAPP and ROA when developing a 100-year coastal
   adaptation strategy in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. Lessons include the
   value of collaborative community and decision maker processes for
   increasing understanding about the changing risk over time, and the need
   to take early actions that enable a shift in pathway before those
   actions become ineffective. Modifications to the methods highlighted the
   importance of using several plausible scenarios for stress-testing
   options; considering costs and consent-ability early, to avoid the
   perception that hard protection will last; which criteria are
   appropriate for communities to assess; and making many pathways visible
   for future decision makers. We learned about the difficulties shifting
   thinking from short-term protection actions to longer-term anticipatory
   strategies. We found that a pathways system will require ongoing
   political leadership and governance with monitoring systems that can
   manage the adaptive process over long timeframes, by governments and
   their constituent communities.},

Abstract = {Marine social-ecological systems (SES) have been providing important
   cultural, social, and economic services for many centuries. They are,
   however, increasingly threatened by fast changing environmental,
   ecological, and socio-economic conditions. As historical marine research
   is increasingly developing into a multidisciplinary endeavour, it offers
   outstanding points of departure to analyse historic events and the
   response and adaptation of the respective SES. Such knowledge helps to
   inform today's fisheries management and promotes successful management
   of changing ecosystems. Here, we compile and analyse historical data
   (1890-1950) of the German Western Baltic Sea fishery SES. This period is
   characterised by a series of strong impacts due to political,
   technological, economic, and ecological changes, such as two world wars,
   a global economic crisis, and other economic or ecological disasters. In
   our opinion, potential negative effects of those events were in the past
   attenuated by the system's high capacity to adapt. However, most of the
   fishers ` historic options on how to respond and adapt have recently
   become no longer available. New threats (e.g. climate change) have
   emerged instead. We conclude that today's fisheries management needs to
   integrate options of adaptation by exhausting all present or future
   opportunities. Adaptive fisheries management should not only focus on
   environmental change but need to include socio-economic change as well.},

Pages = {185-215},
Abstract = {Securing world food security in light of the impact of climate change
   may be one of the biggest challenges we face in this century. Rising
   temperatures, more intense droughts, floods, and greater weather
   variability all mean productivity losses to crops and livestock. Greater
   numbers of crop failures, livestock deaths, forest fires and damage to
   fishery infrastructure are already imposing economic losses and
   undermining food security.
   Impacts of climate change can influence the whole food supply chain and
   all four dimensions of food security, namely: availability of food from
   domestic production and imports, access to resources for producing or
   buying food, stability of food supply, utilization of food. In parallel,
   growing energy demand is adding additional string and could compete with
   food security objectives.
   As importance to bioenergy is growing, the challenges and opportunities
   posed by biofuels, in view of the world's food security, energy and
   sustainable development needs to be addressed. In this paper the
   challenges of climate change and bioenergy on food security are
   discussed together with potential adaptation and mitigation options. The
   key messages from the FAO's high level conference on ``World Food
   Security: The Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy{''} are

Abstract = {Intertidal mussel species are frequently exposed to changes of
   environmental parameters related to tidal regimes that include a
   multitude of stressors that they must avoid or tolerate by developing
   adaptive strategies. In particular, besides air exposure during low
   tides, intertidal mussels are also subjected to warming and,
   consequently, to higher risk of desiccation. However, scarce information
   is available regarding the responses of mussels to tidal regimes,
   particularly in the presence of other stressors such as increased
   temperature. Investigating the impacts of such combination of conditions
   will allow to understand the possible impacts that both factors
   interaction may generate to these intertidal organisms. To this end, the
   present study evaluated the impacts of different temperatures (18
   degrees C and 21 degrees C) on Mytilus galloprovincialis when
   continuously submersed or exposed to a tidal regime for 14 days. Results
   showed that in mussels exposed to increased temperature under submersion
   conditions, the stress induced was enough to activate mussels'
   antioxidant defenses (namely glutathione peroxidase, GPx), preventing
   oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, LPO; protein carbonylation, PC).
   In mussels exposed to tides at control temperature, metabolic capacity
   increased (electron transport system activity, ETS), and GPx was
   induced, despite resulting in increased LPO levels. Moreover, the
   combination of tides and temperature increase led to a significant
   decrease of lipid (LIP) content, activation of antioxidant defenses
   (superoxide dismutase, SOD; GPx) and increase of oxidized glutathione
   (GSSG), despite these mechanisms were not sufficient to prevent
   increased cellular damage. Therefore, the combination of increased
   temperature and air exposure induced higher oxidative stress inmussels.
   These findings indicate that increasing globalwarming could be more
   impacting to intertidal organisms compared to organisms continuously
   submersed. Furthermore, our results indicate that air exposure can act
   as a confounding factor when assessing the impacts of different
   stressors in organisms living in coastal systems.(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Vulnerability to coastal erosion in The Gambia: Empirical experience
   from Gunjur},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion is a major challenge along the coast of The Gambia
   besides the increasing pressure from climate change. This poses
   tremendous influences on physical and the socio-economic vulnerability
   of the coastal communities, in the form of negative impacts on lives and
   livelihoods. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the vulnerability
   of households to the impacts of coastal erosion. As a result, this study
   focused on the assessment and mapping of the social vulnerability of
   households to coastal erosion in Gunjur village. An interdisciplinary
   and mixed-method approaches were used in the study. The MOVE
   system-thinking framework was used to develop and select social
   vulnerability indicators. Geographic Information Systems technique was
   employed in data integration and mapping of the vulnerability of
   households. The outcome of the study revealed that 90\% of the
   households were highly vulnerable to coastal erosion, however, women
   were perceived to be relatively more vulnerable. The study found high
   levels of exposure and susceptibility of the households to coastal
   erosion, given the limited adaptation capacity. It was found that 74\%
   of the households do not have sustainable adaptation strategies to the
   impacts of coastal erosion. Integrating coastal protection measures into
   climate change adaptation and mitigation policy framework was a key
   recommendation towards reducing the impacts of human factors on coastal
   erosion. Alternative sources of livelihoods and mind building are
   required to build the resilience of households and enhance human
   security in the coastal communities of The Gambia.},

Abstract = {There is increasing awareness worldwide that traditional
   flood-mitigation strategies that attempt to control the flow of water
   only increase the likelihood of catastrophic consequences in the long
   run, when failure inevitably occurs after years of complacency and
   development behind flood barriers. Amphibious architecture is a
   non-defensive flood mitigation and climate change adaptation strategy
   that works in synchrony with a floodprone region's natural cycles of
   flooding, allowing water to flow rather than creating an obstruction.
   Since the height to which an amphibious building rises is not
   necessarily fixed but adapts to the variable depth of flood water,
   amphibiation can accommodate rising sea levels and land subsidence as
   well. Amphibious retrofitting can provide measurable cost savings
   compared to other flood mitigation strategies, performing well in loss
   avoidance studies for both flood and wind damage. An amphibious approach
   to planning and construction recognizes the beneficial aspects of
   seasonal and occasional flooding, allowing us not merely to live with
   water, but to thrive with it. This paper reviews case studies of both
   existing and proposed amphibious buildings, with discussion of their
   systems and components. It also discusses the limitations of amphibious
   construction, some of the regulatory obstacles that have discouraged its
   development, and possible paths forward. The first International
   Conference on Amphibious Architecture, Design and Engineering, ICAADE
   2015, was held in Bangkok, Thailand, in August 2015. The second, ICAADE
   2017, will convene at the University of Waterloo in Canada in June 2017.},

Title = {Stakeholder perceptions on actions for marine fisheries adaptation to
   climate change},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1430-1444},
Abstract = {Fisheries are under threat from climate change, with observed impacts
   greater in faster-warming regions. This research investigated current
   and future potential for climate adaptation to be integrated into
   fisheries management strategies using Tasmanian commercial wild-catch
   fisheries as a case study, and then identified obstacles and
   recommendations for fisheries management to better adapt to future
   climate changes. We conducted qualitative interviews with fisheries
   stakeholders and experts to identify their perceptions of the effects of
   climate change on commercial wild-catch fisheries and local marine
   ecosystems, as well as opportunities for enhanced management in the
   future. The results show that climate adaptation in Tasmania fisheries
   management has largely been passive or incidental to date, and suggested
   future improvements may incorporate: (1) more or different scientific
   information and better application; (2) government reviews, reforms and
   stronger action; (3) industry changes and taking responsibility for the
   issue; (4) gaining more funding and resources; and (5) increasing
   education, extension and interaction among stakeholder groups.
   Implementation of the recommendations suggested in this study would help
   create a more forward-thinking and proactive response to climate change
   for Tasmanian fisheries, as well as a more flexible and resilient
   fishing industry that is better able to absorb shocks related to climate
   change.},

Volume = {88},
Pages = {279-284},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {For Pacific Island communities, social change has always been a part of
   their socio-political lives, while environmental changes were always
   transient and reversible, so that they understood and engaged with their
   ocean as a provider for food, culture and life. However, recent
   unprecedented and irreversible changes brought on by global climate
   change challenge this norm and alter their lagoons and adjacent oceans
   into unfamiliar territories. Climate change already is affecting, and
   has been projected to continue to disproportionately impact, Pacific
   Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) through rising temperatures,
   sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion of freshwater resources, coastal
   erosion, an increase in extreme weather events, altered rainfall
   patterns, coral reef bleaching, and ocean acidification. While knowledge
   is building about potential impacts on ecosystems and some target
   stocks, there is little information available for communities,
   governments and regional institutions on how to respond to these changes
   and adapt. What are the consequences for marine conservation, fisheries
   management and coastal planning at local, national and regional scales?
   What strategies and policies can best support and enable responses to
   these challenges across different scales? What opportunities exist to
   finance necessary climate change adaptation and mitigation measures? To
   consider these urgent issues, this paper synthesises innovative research
   methods, and studies many of the looming scientific, policy and
   governance challenges from a diversity of perspectives and disciplines.},

Title = {Climate Change Impacts on the Seasonal Variation of Hydro-Physical
   Characteristics in the Persian Gulf},
Journal = {ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
Abstract = {Climate change affects atmospheric circulation patterns and intensifies
   recurrent extreme weather events across the globe. It has resulted in
   increasing air temperatures, rising sea levels, and alterations in
   precipitation patterns, which will immensely influence the
   hydro-environment regime in semi-enclosed water bodies (e.g., gulfs and
   estuaries). The Persian Gulf (PG), the world's hottest sea, is a
   regional hotspot for climate change. This study investigates how the
   interplay between climate change and the meteorological variables
   affects salinity, temperature, and density of water mass concerning
   water circulation patterns (WCPs) in PG. It contributes to representing
   a perspective of meteorological conditions over the region and
   projecting expected seasonal variations of PG hydro-physical properties
   at the beginning of the next decade. For these purposes, we used the
   downscaled data of 2030 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 (representative
   concentration pathway) scenarios to run the hydrodynamic model and also
   used a 54-year time series (1948-2002) for reference model representing
   the historical state (HS). The findings project distinguishable
   temperature rise (reaching 37 \& DEG;C in summer over vast areas),
   salinity rise in most parts (up to +5.4 practical salinity units
   relative to HS at the northwestern head in spring), and an increase in
   vertical density gradients leading to an increase in speeds of surface
   currents. These alterations in physical properties significantly
   influence chemical and biological processes in PG, potentially resulting
   in aquatic degradation and ecological issues. Therefore, the findings
   are remarkable for policymakers to develop adaptation management plans
   in the PG region in line with sustainable development goals.},

Title = {Coastal to inland: Expansion of prawn farming for adaptation to climate
   change in Bangladesh},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {67-76},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The practice of prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) farming is widespread
   in coastal Bangladesh due to favorable biophysical resources. However,
   export-oriented prawn farming is particularly vulnerable to climate
   change in coastal Bangladesh. This study identified different climatic
   variables, including salinity, coastal flooding, cyclone, sea-level
   rise, water temperature, drought, and rainfall have profound effects on
   prawn farming in the Bagerhat area of southwest Bangladesh. Considering
   extreme vulnerability to the effects of climate change on prawn
   production, one of the adaptation strategies is to translocate prawn
   culture from coastal to inland (i.e., Bagerhat-Gopalganj) that appear
   less vulnerable to climate change. Although the prospects for prawn-carp
   polyculture and integrated prawn-fish-rice farming are positive in
   Gopalganj, a number of challenges were identified for the expansion of
   prawn culture. We suggest that institutional support would help to adopt
   prawn production. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Differential livelihood adaptation to social-ecological change in
   coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {451-463},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Social-ecological changes, brought about by the rapid growth of the
   aquaculture industry and the increased occurrence of climatic stressors,
   have significantly affected the livelihoods of coastal communities in
   Asian mega-deltas. This paper explores the livelihood adaptation
   responses of households of different wealth classes, the heterogeneous
   adaptation opportunities, barriers and limits (OBLs) faced by these
   households and the dynamic ways in which these factors interact to
   enhance or impede adaptive capacities. A mixed methods approach was used
   to collect empirical evidence from two villages in coastal Bangladesh.
   Findings reveal that households' adaptive capacities largely depend on
   their wealth status, which not only determine their availability of
   productive resources, but also empower them to navigate
   social-ecological change in desirable ways. Households operate within a
   shared response space, which is shaped by the broader socio-economic and
   political landscape, as well as their previous decisions that can lock
   them in to particular pathways. While an adaptive response may be
   effective for one social group, it may cause negative externalities that
   can undermine the adaptation options and outcomes of another group.
   Adaptation OBLs interact in complex ways; the extent to which these OBLs
   affect different households depend on the specific livelihood activities
   being considered and the differential values and interests they hold. To
   ensure more equitable and environmentally sustainable livelihoods in
   future, policies and programs should aim to expand households'
   adaptation space by accounting for the heterogeneous needs and complex
   interdependencies between response processes of different groups.},

Title = {Risks posed by climate change to the delivery of Water Framework
   Directive objectives in the UK},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1043-1055},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) is novel because it integrates
   water quality, water resources, physical habitat and, to some extent,
   flooding for all surface and groundwaters and takes forward river basin
   management. However, the WFD does not explicitly mention risks posed by
   climate change to the achievement of its environmental objectives. This
   is despite the fact that the time scale for the implementation process
   and achieving particular objectives extends into the 2020s, when climate
   models project changes in average temperature and precipitation. This
   paper begins by reviewing the latest UK climate change scenarios and the
   wider policy and science context of the WFD. We then examine the
   potential risks of climate change to key phases of the River Basin
   Management Process that underpin the WFD (such as charactelisation of
   liver basins and their water bodies, risk assessments to identify
   pressures and impacts, programmes of measures (POMs) options appraisal,
   monitoring and modelling, policy and management activities). Despite
   these risks the WFD could link new policy and participative mechanisms
   (being established for the River Basin Management Plans) to the emerging
   framework of national and regional climate change adaptation policy. The
   risks are identified with a view to informing policy opportunities,
   objective setting, adaptation strategies and the research agenda. Key
   knowledge gaps have already been identified during the implementation of
   the WFD, such as the links between hydromorphology and ecosystem status,
   but the overarching importance of linking climate change to these
   considerations needs to be highlighted. The next generation of
   (probabilistic) climate change scenarios will present new opportunities
   and challenges for risk analysis and policy-making. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article presents a methodology aimed at improving mid-term power
   system resilience at transmission substations in areas potentially
   affected by floods, combining hardening strategies and quantitative
   metrics. It takes into account flood forecasts from a hydrological model
   and the location of electrical equipment to perform impact assessment
   ``as is{''}and with resilience planning strategies. Thus, the impact of
   floods on the grid is evaluated over a range of realistic flood
   scenarios, based on the accumulated cost and load energy unserved as
   metrics together with future transmission system expansion capacity
   projections. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation is aimed
   at minimizing accumulated cost and load energy unserved with optimal
   hardening of substations, assuming that any non-hardened substation
   disabled by flooding must be repaired. Furthermore, the methodology is
   demonstrated in the coastal area of Texas with simulations of floods
   based on the rainfall of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Ultimately, the
   choice of the most appropriate mitigation strategies shall optimize
   resilience metrics and/or cost indicators with robustness over a range
   of scenarios.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {178-185},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Policymakers and natural resource managers are increasingly recognizing
   the importance of broader geographic and gender participation in
   assessing climate vulnerability and developing effective adaptation
   policies. When such participation is limited, climate mitigation and
   adaptation polices may miss key opportunities to support vulnerable
   communities, and thus inadvertently reinforce the vulnerability of
   marginalized groups. This paper reports rich qualitative data from women
   leaders in conservation, development and climate adaptation projects to
   support local communities across seven Pacific Island nations. The
   results indicate the following priorities to support climate adaptation
   policies in the Pacific: (1) increased recognition for the importance of
   traditional knowledge; (2) greater support for local women's groups,
   including strategic planning and training to access climate finance
   mechanisms; and (3) climate policies that consider alternative metrics
   for women's empowerment and inclusion, formalize women's land rights,
   and provide land for climate refugees. Existing evidence is discussed
   which supports the importance of these priorities in the Pacific. Their
   input identifies research gaps in climate adaptation and provides
   important guidance for governments, non-governmental organizations, and
   development agencies leading climate adaptation efforts.},

   additional losses of coal and economic effect reduce. This article
   presents an approach to adaptation of the slope height considering the
   capabilities of backhoes in seam extracting which can sufficiently
   decrease coal losses and intensify open pit mining. This approach is
   based on a system of mining and geometrical calculations, allowing

Abstract = {The major objective of this paper is to identify the vulnerability
   factors and examine the effectiveness of disaster mitigation measures
   undertaken by individuals, government and non-government organisations
   to mitigate the impacts of cyclones in the Bangladesh coast experiencing
   from Cyclone Aila. The primary data were collected from two villages of
   southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh using questionnaire survey and
   interviews of the key informants. The data were analysed using the
   descriptive and inferential statistics. This paper reveals that the
   disaster management measures have a significant role to lessen the
   impacts of the cyclonic event, especially in pre-disaster preparedness,
   cyclone warning message dissemination, evacuation and post-disaster
   rehabilitation. The households, who have access to shelter, find weather
   forecast regularly and adopted pre-disaster awareness measures are
   relatively less susceptible to hazard's impacts. The disaster management
   measures undertaken by individuals and GOs and NGOs help coastal people
   to save their lives and property from the negative impacts of cyclones.
   The analysis shows that the NGOs' role is more effective and efficient
   than the GOs in cyclone disaster management. This paper identifies
   distance to shelter, participation in disaster training, efficient
   warning, etc. as the influential factors of vulnerability cyclones. The
   analysis finds the households as less affected who have adopted disaster
   preparedness measures. However, this paper concludes that the effective
   and proper disaster management and mitigation measures are very crucial
   to shield the lives and properties of the Bangladeshi coastal people.},

Title = {Seaweed Value Chain Stakeholder Perspectives for Food and Environmental
   Safety Hazards},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With a world population estimated at 10 billion people by 2050, the
   challenge to secure healthy and safe food is evident. Seaweed is a
   potential answer to this challenge. Expanding the use of seaweed in food
   systems requires an emphasis on safe practices to avoid adverse human
   health effects after consumption and irreversible damage to marine
   ecosystems. This study aims to evaluate relevant food safety and
   environmental safety hazards, monitoring measures, and mitigation
   strategies in the seaweed sector. For this study, a literature review,
   survey (n = 36), and interviews (n = 12) were conducted to identify
   hazards. The review and interviews aimed at pinpointing monitoring
   measures and mitigation strategies applied, while the survey revealed
   data gaps and further actions needed for the sector. Relevant food
   safety hazards include (inorganic) arsenic, iodine, and heavy metals,
   among others, such as pathogenic bacteria, while environmental hazards
   include environmental pathogens and parasites introduced into the
   ecosystem by domesticated seaweed, among others. Measures applied aim at
   preventing or mitigating hazards through good hygienic or manufacturing
   practices, food safety procedures or protocols, or pre-site farm
   selection. Although the future needs of the seaweed sector vary, for
   some, harmonized advice and protocols that align with a changing food
   system and hazard knowledge development as well as information on the
   benefits of seaweed and regulating climate and water quality may help.},

Title = {Exploring urban green packages as part of Nature-based Solutions for
   climate change adaptation measures in rapidly growing cities of the
   Global South},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {310},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Given a lot of elusive information on the use and implementation of
   Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in the Global South, this review provides a
   synthesis of the evidence on the: -(1) distribution of urban green
   technologies in form of arboriculture and urban agriculture as a part of
   NbS packages for the sustainability of cities against population growth
   and impact of climate change; and (2) options of integrating and
   mainstreaming various NbS packages into city development policies,
   planning processes, and decision-making agendas. The sustainability of
   urban green as part of NbS packages and the usefulness for improvement
   of livelihoods is determined by the spatial (geographical location) and
   temporal (time of action) scales, and socio-ecological and institutional
   factors. Various NbS packages have shown the ability for use as climate
   change adaptation measures throughout the world. These functions include
   protection from soil erosion, protection from inland flooding, buffering
   natural resources against drier and more variable climates, protection
   from coastal hazards and sea-level rise, moderation of urban heatwaves
   and effects of heat island, and managing storm-water and flooding in
   urban areas. Furthermore, the benefits of urban agriculture and
   arboriculture include use as sources of food and generation of income;
   improve recreation and social interactions, and the sustainability of
   biodiversity. They also mitigate the impact of environmental pollution
   and climate change through reduction of gas emissions and act as carbon
   sinks. While the starting capital and lack of policy on urban
   agriculture and arboriculture in many countries, the importance of the
   industry is inevitably a useful agenda especially in the Global South
   due to vulnerability to the impact of climate change. This review also
   suggests the inclusion of all institutions, governments, and relevant
   stakeholders to emphasize gender sensitization at all levels of planning
   and decision-making in food production and adaptation measures to
   climate change.},

Title = {The future is behind us: traditional ecological knowledge and resilience

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Local and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) systems are thought to
   be particularly valuable for fostering adaptation and resilience to
   environmental and climate change. This paper investigates the role of
   TEK in adaptation to social-ecological change at the community level. It
   is unique because it takes a longitudinal perspective and draws on
   historical and contemporary data. We focus on a case study from Hawai'i
   where TEK, cultural identity, and their relationships to environmental
   stewardship are locally seen as the basis for social resilience. We
   describe how coping strategies and indicators of social resilience have
   changed over time; the role of TEK in resilience; and the implications
   for climate change adaptation. Our results show the relative
   contributions of some strategies to cope with social-ecological change
   have decreased (e.g., forecasting, storage, and mobility), while others
   have maintained but adapted (e.g., livelihood diversification, knowledge
   transmission and storage, communal pooling, and cultural identity),
   underscoring the importance of considering multiple strategies together
   to promote community resilience. The article argues that understanding
   how people responded in the past can suggest relevant and culturally
   appropriate ways-through specific language, values, reference points,
   and indicators expressed in narratives, proverbs, and songs-of situating
   climate change and framing adaptation planning. This research also shows
   that TEK is vital for adaptation to environmental change broadly and
   climate change in particular, for subsistence-based, indigenous, rural
   communities, as well as place-based communities living in mixed
   economies. Thus, it is relevant for the larger Pacific Islands region
   and other areas that represent a continuum from rural-to-urban and
   traditional-to-global economies and lifeways.},

Abstract = {To predict the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and the

   reliable marine ecosystem response models such as biogeochemical models

   parameters and processes that are modified by climate change and
   examined their representations in biogeochemical ecosystem models. The
   interactions among important aspects of marine ecosystem modelling are
   not often considered due to complexity: these include the use of
   multiple IPCC scenarios, ensemble modelling approach, independent
   calibration datasets, the consideration of changes in cloud cover, ocean
   currents, wind speed, sea-level rise, storm frequency, storm intensity,
   and the incorporation of species adaptation to changing environmental
   conditions. Including our recommendations in future marine modelling
   studies could help improve the accuracy and reliability of model

Abstract = {The present study explores the El Nino and La Nino impacts on coastal
   areas at the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh. El Nino and La Nina rise
   imposes great threats to the existence of coastal vulnerability by
   affecting water-related resources like fish and various livelihood
   activities and important ecosystem of the coastal zones of Bangladesh.
   El Nino and La Nino have a significant relationship with rainfall,
   temperature and hydrology at the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh. Both
   secondary and primary data have been used in this study which were
   collected from nearest meteorological station of the study area. The
   results of this study reflected that the monthly maximum temperature of
   Bangladesh during 1980-2015 increased in February, May-October and
   nearly equal in other months. The country average monthly maximum
   temperature slightly increased in winter seasons in December to
   February. Similarly, during monsoon season, the highest rainfall is in
   June and July months. In addition, in monsoon seasons, rainfall
   intensity is high in southeastern and northeastern region. Therefore,
   Bangladesh government should give more priority to pay proper outlook to
   these issues as well as take suitable steps to promote strategy to
   mitigate El Nino and La Nina rise impacts and thus protect the valuable
   resources, the coastal landscape and people. This study would be helpful
   to identify the effective success of the addressed problems, in
   practice, and to develop an adaptation and mitigation strategies. The
   proposed model could be the pathways to reduce El Nino and La Nino
   impact on coastal areas in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {The successful implementation and sustainability of many marsh
   restoration efforts, including coastal adaptation to buffer inundation
   and mitigate sea level rise, often hinges upon support from surrounding
   human communities. Yet, stakeholder engagement in these projects remains
   relatively undervalued and underutilized. We present the
   Social-Ecological Systems, Adaptive Management, and Engagement (SESAME)
   framework that provides reciprocal connections between the human and
   ecological components of restoration efforts and the resulting
   management and engagement needs. We built and describe this framework
   through discussion of two case studies of coastal restoration efforts in
   southern New England salt marshes. The first case study focuses on the
   use of sediment placement to increase the elevation of the surface of a
   drowning marsh in Rhode Island as an interim measure to protect against
   sea level rise. The second case study describes the use of living
   shorelines for erosion mitigation on a salt marsh in Massachusetts.
   These cases included significant partner and stakeholder engagement and
   provided important lessons learned for practical implementation of the
   SESAME framework. Valuable lessons included the need for engagement
   throughout the entirety of the process, specific clarification of roles
   within the restoration efforts, and flexibility in implementation and
   goal setting.},

Abstract = {Extreme hydro-meteorological events such as hurricanes, storms and
   intense precipitation are already being felt in many coastal cities due
   to climate change causing major flood losses. It is time to implement
   alternative adaptation and mitigation solutions. In developed countries
   there is a growing appreciation of the benefits of wetlands as a flood
   protection strategy, however, there is still need for further research
   on quantifying the benefits of these solutions to justify the investment
   and replicate them in developing countries. Therefore, using the City of
   Duran, Ecuador, as a case study, this research develops an approach on
   how to incorporate wetlands in hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to
   quantify peak flows' reduction and delineate different flood zone
   scenarios for the city. The results of this study underline the
   importance of carrying out additional research in quantifying the
   benefits of wetlands and other ecosystem-based solutions, using
   hydrologic and hydraulic models, as these can prove to be efficient and
   sustainable strategies to mitigate flooding.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires integration of multiple system
   components and uses, identifying and striving for sustainable outcomes,
   precaution in avoiding deleterious actions, and adaptation based on
   experience to achieve effective solutions. Efforts underway or in
   planning to restore and manage two major coastal ecosystems, the
   Chesapeake Bay (Chesapeake Bay Program) and coastal Louisiana (Louisiana
   Coastal Area Plan and Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan), are examined with
   respect to these four principles. These multifaceted restoration
   programs represent among the foremost challenges for science and coastal
   management in the United States and, thereby, have important
   implications for addressing the coastal environmental crises being
   experienced throughout the world. Although frameworks exist for
   integration of management objectives in both regions, the technical
   ability for the quantitatively integrated assessment of multiple
   stressors and strategies is still in an early stage of development.
   Science is also being challenged to identify sustainable futures, but
   emerging concepts of ecosystem resilience offer some promising
   approaches. Precautionary management is best conceived with regard to
   fisheries, but should become a more explicit consideration for managing
   risks and avoiding unanticipated consequences of restoration activities.
   Adaptive management is embraced as a central process in coastal
   Louisiana ecosystem restoration, but has not formally been implemented
   in the more mature Chesapeake Bay restoration. Based on these
   experiences, ecosystem-based management could be advanced by: (1)
   orienting more scientific activity to providing the solutions needed for
   ecosystem restoration; (2) building bridges crossing scientific and
   management barriers to more effectively integrate science and
   management; (3) directing more attention to understanding and predicting
   achievable restoration outcomes that consider possible state changes and
   ecosystem resilience; (4) improving the capacity of science to
   characterize and effectively communicate uncertainty; and (5) fully
   integrating modeling, observations, and research to facilitate more
   adaptive management. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The role of culture for coastal disaster risk reduction measures:
   Empirical evidence from northern and southern Europe},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {297-309},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent and historic high-impact events have demonstrated significant
   flood risks to many coastal areas in Europe and across the globe.
   Understanding the behavior of humans in relation to risk management
   poses grand challenges for both natural and social sciences and
   humanities. The study analyzes the cultural aspects of coastal risk
   management and illustrates path-dependencies of concrete disaster risk
   reduction measures in relation to local contexts in European coastal
   regions in Northern and South Western Europe. It adopts a comparative
   approach by targeting risk perception and risk management related to
   coastal floods and erosion, induced by storms and sea level rise, in two
   contrasting coastal areas: German coastal state Schleswig-Holstein at
   the Baltic Sea (especially the communities Eckernforde and Timmendorfer
   Strand) and the Portuguese barrier island system of Ria Formosa
   (especially the community of Faro Beach). Both regions are very low
   lying with only a few meters above sea level and exposed to similar
   hazards such as erosion and floods induced by coastal storms, and while
   they are both attractive touristic destinations, they are culturally,
   socio-economically and politically very different. The geographical and
   the socio-cultural contexts of the case study regions are assessed first
   using an explorative approach, followed by an analysis of the relevance
   of cultural aspects for the implementation of disaster risk reduction
   measures. The study addresses both first responders (city authorities,
   citizens) and scholars. It is found that the choice of risk reduction
   measures hinges on the values underlying people's perspectives about the
   desired outcomes of specific measures and that the role of identity and
   meaning making are still undervalued in decision making processes. It
   concludes that subjective capacities formed by cultural identities,
   knowledge, trust coupled with a variety of factors of socio-economic and
   political texture are important to understand local decision making
   processes. The authors found that lively `culture of risk memory `,
   `trust in scientific information and community ` as well as decision
   making of coastal authorities coupled with inclusiveness and
   participation of communities in formulating and implementing disaster
   risk reduction measures are prerequisites for successful collaboration
   and in turn execution of disaster risk reduction measures.},

Title = {Influence of global warming on coastal infrastructural instability},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-25},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The increasing infrastructure instability is an important issue in
   relation to the influences of global climate change in urban areas. A
   serious issue pertaining to this is the dual nature of damage triggered
   by events combined with climate change and natural hazards. For example,
   catastrophic damage could result from the combination of global warming
   with a great earthquake, which is a worst-case scenario. Although this
   worst-case scenario has rarely occurred and presents a low probability
   of occurrence, countermeasures must be prepared in advance based on an
   appropriate response and adaptation strategies. After an overview of
   possible infrastructural instabilities caused by global warming,
   methodologies are proposed placing emphasis on the increasing
   probability of infrastructural instability triggered by natural hazards
   resulting from groundwater-level (GWL) variations. These effects are
   expected to be particularly serious in coastal regions because of the
   influence of the rising sea level resulting from global warming. The
   influence of sea-level rises (SLR) will become apparent along with land
   subsidence because groundwater abstraction will become severe in coastal
   regions. Additionally, the probability of earthquake liquefaction
   increases if GWL rises in accompaniment with SLR. Using case histories,
   we examined the possible occurrence of these natural hazards as a result
   of global warming. Finally, possible countermeasures and adaptation
   strategies for reducing and mitigating infrastructure damage accelerated
   by global warming are described for each case in specific regions. In
   particular, special attention should be paid to adaptation strategies in
   coastal lowlands, which particularly suffer from the effects of land
   subsidence.},

Abstract = {Commercial marine fishing contributes significantly to the Australian
   economy, and has great importance for coastal communities. However,
   climate change presents significant challenges for Australia's fishing
   industries, now and into the future. With greater use of targeted
   information, the fishing industry will be better placed to minimise the
   negative impacts and take advantage of opportunities associated with the
   effects of climate change. The future of the fishing
   industry-specifically wild capture fisheries-will depend on its ability
   and capacity to apply appropriate adaptation strategies for its
   viability and sustainability in the long-term. Knowledge regarding
   expected long-term changes in species distributions, improved weather
   and seasonal climate forecasts and their influence on target species,
   and better understanding of species tolerances, can inform adaptation
   responses. This paper provides a review of recent advances in research
   addressing Australia's priorities in relation to commercial marine
   fisheries' responses to current and anticipated future climate change
   impacts, and considers barriers and adaptation options for fisheries
   management over the near-term planning horizon of 5-7 years.},

Abstract = {Adaptive learning about nature, based on observations and continual
   rethinking, dates back to Native Americans in what we call Traditional
   Ecological Knowledge. Fast forward to 1950+, when Eugene, Howard, and
   William Odum promoted sound science and its use in managing
   ecosystems-called adaptive management (AM). What began as an instinctive
   way of thinking and deciding how to obtain resources using accumulated
   information became a structured, science-based process that improves
   over time, given continual critiques of projects, clarification of
   definitions, and analyses of outcomes. The basic need is still to
   sustain ecosystem services despite uncertainties, such as climate
   change. I report recent innovations in the AM of estuaries and coasts
   that can add knowledge and improve future efforts. Innovations include
   new guidelines and approaches to confront uncertainty, engage
   stakeholders, improve governance, prioritize actions, centralize the
   role of science, and manage holistically. AM has been effective along
   the coast of Denmark and in several estuaries, and it is evolving
   elsewhere. In The Netherlands, Spain, California, and Oregon, large
   field experiments are generating ``learning while restoring{''}
   (adaptive restoration, AR). AM and AR can help managers of coastal
   ecosystems and watersheds mitigate the impacts of rising sea levels, sea
   storms, and human disturbances. Science-based decision-making will
   become more nimble and protection/restoration more effective as
   innovations and model approaches are tailored to individual estuaries
   and coasts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {260},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {This paper presents a novel climate mitigation action index to evaluate
   various aspects linked to the implementation of Sustainable Energy
   Action Plans (SEAP), which define the carbon dioxide emission reduction
   targets and outline the key actions to achieve these at the municipal
   level.
   A SEAP Implementation Index (SII) is developed and applied to study
   climate change mitigation actions implemented by 102 Municipalities
   belonging to the Metropolitan City of Milan (Italy) in the framework of
   the Covenant of Mayors (CoM). The SII is composed of six categories and
   16 sub-indicators and results in a final score ranging from 1 to 10. The
   average rating obtained in the case study area is 4.2, and only eleven
   Municipalities achieved an evaluation higher than 6. The sensitivity
   analysis shows the index robustness against variations in the applied
   weight factors.
   The population engagement and the management of the initiative,
   neglected by many Municipalities mostly because of a lack of funding and
   personnel, are identified as the most critical aspects. Despite the
   massive participation in the CoM, no quantitative analysis of the SEAPs
   implementation has been proposed until now and this study shows some
   severe shortcomings in their application.},

Title = {Implementing Pre-Emptive Managed Retreat: Constraints and Novel Insights},
Journal = {CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {66-80},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose of Review Managed retreat will be inevitable where other
   adaptation options, such as protective structures or building
   restrictions, provide only temporary respite or are otherwise
   uneconomic, technically impractical or both. Here, we focus on the
   implementation of pre-emptive managed retreat, providing examples of how
   it can be sequenced, socialised and given the governance enablers
   necessary for implementation. Recent Findings Ongoing sea-level rise
   during the twenty-first century and beyond poses huge adaptation
   challenges, especially for low-lying coastal and floodplain settlements.
   Settlements are already functionally disrupted from repetitive
   non-extreme flooding and research shows that sea-level rise will impact
   far more people, far sooner than previously thought, as more powerful
   storms, heavy rainfall and rising groundwater coincide with higher
   tides. To date, most examples of managed retreat have been post-disaster
   responses following damage and disruption. Pre-emptive managed retreat,
   by contrast, has yet to become a well-accepted and widely practised
   adaptation response. Nevertheless, there are increasing examples of
   research and practice on how pre-emptive managed retreat can be
   designed, sequenced and implemented alongside other forms of adaptation
   within anticipatory forms of governance. The current state of knowledge
   about managed retreat is reviewed and critical insights and lessons for
   governance and policy-making are given. Several novel examples from New
   Zealand are presented to address some of the implementation gaps. Goals
   and principles are enunciated to inform long-term adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the impact of climate change on health,
   including local adaptation strategies. A mixed-method approach has been
   used in this study. The results reveal that increasing the frequency of
   flooding, severity of riverbank erosion and drought, and rising disease
   outbreak are the highest indicators of climate change perceived by
   riverine island (char) dwellers, which is similar to the observed data.
   It also uncovers, approximately all respondents encounter several
   health-related issues during different seasons where prevailing cold and
   cough with fever, skin diseases, and diarrhoea are the leading ailments.
   Several adaptation strategies are accommodated by char inhabitants in
   order to enhance resilience against the climate change health impacts,
   but the paucity of money, disrupted communication, lack of formal
   health-care centre are the most obstacles to the sustainability of
   adaptation. This research recommends that healthcare-associated project
   should be performed through proper monitoring for exterminating char
   dwellers' health issues.},

Title = {Impacts of Climate Change on Outdoor Workers and Their Safety: Some
   Research Priorities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {The literature on the potential impacts of climate change on the health
   of outdoor workers has received limited attention as a whole, and in
   sub-Saharan African countries in particular. Yet, substantial numbers of
   workers are experiencing the health effects of elevated temperature, in
   combination with changes in precipitation patterns, climate extremes and
   the effects of air pollution, which have a potential impact on their
   safety and wellbeing. With increased temperatures within urban
   settlements and frequent heats waves, there has been a sudden rise in
   the occurrence of heat-related illness leading to higher levels of
   mortality, as well as other adverse health impacts. This paper discusses
   the impacts of extreme heat exposure and health concerns among outdoor
   workers, and the resultant impacts on their productivity and
   occupational safety in tropical developing countries with a focus on
   Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a dearth of such studies. Aside from
   the direct effects caused by extreme heat exposure, other indirect
   health hazards associated with increasing heat among this group includes
   exposures to hazardous chemicals and other vector-borne diseases. In
   addition, reduced work capacity in heat-exposed jobs will continue to
   rise and hinder economic and social development in such countries. There
   is an urgent need for further studies around the health and economic
   impacts of climate change in the workplace, especially in tropical
   developing countries, which may guide the implementation of the measures
   needed to address the problem.},

Title = {Describing adaptation tipping points in coastal flood risk management},
Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {74-86},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Assessing changing coastal flood risk becomes increasingly uncertain
   across multi-decadal timeframes. This uncertainty is a fundamental
   complexity faced in vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning.
   Robust decision making (RDM) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP)
   are two state-of-the-art decision support methods that are useful in
   such situations. In this study we use RDM to identify a small set of
   conditions that cause unacceptable impacts from coastal flooding,
   signifying that an adaptation tipping point is reached. Flexible
   adaptation pathways can then be designed using the DAPP framework. The
   methodology is illustrated using a case study in Australia and
   underpinned by a geographic information system model. The results
   suggest that conditions identified in scenario discovery direct the
   attention of decision-makers towards a small number of uncertainties
   most influential on the vulnerability of a community to changing flood
   patterns. This can facilitate targeted data collection and coastal
   monitoring activities when resources are scarce. Importantly, it can
   also be employed to illustrate more broadly how uncontrolled societal
   development, land use and historic building regulations might exacerbate
   flood impacts in low-lying urban areas. Notwithstanding the challenges
   that remain around simulation modelling and detection of environmental
   change, the results from our study suggest that RDM can be embedded
   within a DAPP framework to better plan for changing coastal flood risks.},

Title = {An approach to assess the world's potential for disaster risk reduction
   through nature-based solutions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {599-608},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NBS) have been increasingly advocated as means
   of achieving a greener and sustainable future. Although discussion on
   the definition, scale and applicability of NBS in country and city-level
   agendas are ongoing, NBS have received less attention in terms of them
   supporting country-level approaches to Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).
   This paper uses a series of indicators reflecting national capability
   and national necessity for NBS as a means to support DRR activities.
   Using both Principal Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis results
   show that of a total of 178 countries, two groups emerge; with countries
   in one group showing high levels of both national capability and
   necessity for NBS. Such countries are also found to be around 23 \% more
   likely to be currently implementing disaster risk reduction actions than
   countries with lower capability and necessity scores, showing that NBS
   are actively supporting DRR activities around the world. Such countries
   are a mixture of Global South and North countries while showing no
   statistical significant differences with respect to socio-economic
   characteristics, indicating that NBS can be equitable means of achieving
   potential synergies between DRR-reducing NBS and grey infrastructure
   projects for climate change adaptation measures.},

Title = {Loss and Damage Estimation for Extreme Weather Events: State of the
   Practice},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Extreme weather, climate-induced events that are episodic (e.g.,
   hurricane, heatwave) or chronic (e.g., sea-level rise, temperature
   change) in nature, is occurring with increasing frequency and severity.
   This places a growing and time-sensitive need on the development and
   implementation of adaptation policies and practices. To motivate
   adaptive behavior, however, requires the ability to deliver improved
   risk-informed decision-making capability. At the crux of this challenge
   is the provision of full and accurate loss and damage accounting of the
   overall impact of an extreme weather event, enabling the business case
   to be made for adaptation investment. We define loss and damage as the
   manifestation of impacts associated with extreme weather that negatively
   affect human and natural systems. Progress in the development of
   adequate loss and damage accounting has been hampered by issues, such as
   discrepancies in conceptual frameworks, problems associated with data
   quantity and quality, and lack of standardized analysis methodologies.
   In this paper, we have discussed the conceptual basis for measuring loss
   and damage, reviewed the state of loss and damage data collection and
   modeling, and offered a narrative on the future direction of the
   practice.},

   climate-carbon cycle model. The paired experiments adopt contrasting,
   idealised approaches to climate change mitigation at different action
   points this century, with total emissions rising to more than two
   trillion tonnes of carbon (TtC). For each pair, the contrasting
   mitigation approaches-capping emissions early versus reducing them to
   zero a few decades later-cause their cumulative emissions trajectories
   to diverge initially, then converge, cross, and diverge again. We find
   that global mean temperature is linear with cumulative emissions across
   all experiments, although differences of up to 1.5 K exist regionally
   when the trajectories of total carbon emitted during the course of the
   two scenarios coincide, for both pairs of experiments. Interestingly,
   although the oceanic precipitation response scales with cumulative
   emissions, the global precipitation response does not, due to a decrease
   in precipitation over land above emissions of around one TtC. Most
   carbon fluxes are less well constrained by cumulative emissions as they
   reach two trillion tonnes. The opposing mitigation approaches have
   different consequences for the Amazon rainforest, which affects the
   linearity with which the carbon cycle responds to cumulative emissions.
   The average Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon Emissions
   (TCRE) is 1.95 K TtC(-1), at the upper end of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change's range of 0.8-2.5 K TtC(-1).},

Abstract = {Tourist destinations in small island developing states are facing
   increasing risk from climate change, threatening not only tourism
   businesses but all destination elements including the community and
   ecosystems. In order to reduce climate risk destination wide, this paper
   first enhances the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change risk
   framework by extending it with destination specific features. This
   extended framework was drawn upon to develop a system model for Vanuatu,
   called the Vanuatu Tourism Adaptation System, using a qualitative
   multi-phase research design. The system highlights economic,
   socio-cultural, political, and environmental variables, how they are
   interlinked and thereby influence climate risk to destinations in
   Vanuatu. It provides a novel tool for understanding climate risk
   reduction within destinations as a holistic system and based on this
   understanding, destination trade-offs and policy recommendations are
   discussed. It can thus aid tourism and climate change decision makers in
   identifying and testing adaptation measures that benefit not only
   tourism but the destination more broadly, including the local community
   and ecosystem health. This study fills a gap in the academic literature
   by enhancing the systemic understanding of climate risk in small island
   developing states destinations and contributes to our understanding of
   tourism as a climate-resilient development pathway.},

Abstract = {A critical question related to climate change concerns to how rising sea
   level will affect underserved populations and medically fragile
   population in coastal zones and floodplains. As sea levels rise, coastal
   waters will regain near-tidal areas and co-mingle with human-made
   pollutants, resulting from decades of industrial and commercial
   activity. This poses potential threat and risks to public health and the
   environment. It is critical that decision makers will initiate a process
   of parsing resources to the mitigation and management of these issues.
   The purpose of this research is to model the inherent dynamics of this
   process and understand how near-term policy decisions will condition the
   dynamics of population health within traditionally underserved and
   medically fragile populations. We use a System Dynamics (SD) approach to
   model and simulate the sensitivity of affected populations to a range of
   remediation policy options intended to address these contaminated
   environments. Our research will assist policy makers to explore and
   prioritize policies with a specific focus on vulnerability, guarantee
   that remediation funds will be utilized effectively and equitably, and
   increase effectiveness of mitigation and management effort.},

Title = {Resilience metrics to inform ecosystem management under global change
   with application to coral reefs},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1088-1096},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. Environmental policy instruments often require that natural resource
   managers safeguard the resilience of ecosystems. However, `resilience'
   has been a difficult concept to operationalise. Two forms of resilience
   are recognised in the ecological literature. `Ecological resilience'
   concerns ecosystems that possess alternative equilibrial states
   (attractors) and has been operationalised in a few systems. `Engineering
   resilience' was developed for ecosystems with a single attractor, but
   its use is confined to systems that gravitate towards a stable
   equilibrium.
   2. We present a general method to quantify engineering resilience that
   can be applied irrespective of an ecosystem's stability or proclivity to
   obey multiple attractors. The technique uses a system model to
   distinguish the effects of globally driven (and essentially
   unmanageable) stressors, such as climate change and ocean acidification,
   fromregional- and local-scale (manageable) stressors on the ecosystem.
   3. We illustrate the technique using a simple coral reef model and find
   it able to calculate the impacts of managing crown-of-thorns starfish
   against a background of increasing stress from climate change and ocean
   acidification.
   4. Resilience analyses using our approach help assess the relative
   importance of local-or regional-scale management interventions under
   varying degrees of global environmental change, even if they preside
   over long-term ecosystem decline. Several frameworks of varying
   complexity are provided to guide the linkage of resilience metrics to
   environmental decision-making.},

Title = {The landscape of sea-level rise adaptation resources: Applying grounded
   theory in California},
Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The threat of climate change caused sea-level rise in coastal areas and
   the associated consequences for human development are extremely high.
   Governments and land managers around the world are developing sea-level
   rise adaptation strategies and physical plans. In this context, the
   urgency for climate services, meaning the provision of climate
   information to meet the decision-making needs of users is emerging as a
   priority. We used a constructivist grounded theory approach to develop
   an assessment framework and answer the question is there alignment
   between supplied climate service written guidance materials and the
   demands of local practitioners working to address sea-level rise in
   their communities. This framework is highly flexible and compares
   guidance resources with local actions. We applied this framework in
   three areas - adaptation barriers, planning processes, and sea-level
   rise actions - to written climate service materials in California to
   test its viability and develop policy and theory relevant insights.
   Through this work we found significant integration of the existing
   climate services in practice in coastal California. We gained important
   insights into how climate services can better meet the needs of local
   practitioners (e.g. by deepening their focus on policy relevant
   materials). We found that the strategic comparison of different climate
   change adaptation actions needs more guidance materials. We also found
   that more explicit support is needed to overcome key policy and legal
   barriers. We uncovered the fact that newer theories, such as those that
   create a typology to compare physical sea-level rise adaption strategies
   have not infiltrated current planning practice and more support is
   needed to help make the bridge possible. These additional services are
   essential to ensure the effectiveness of existing resources.},

Abstract = {In 2025 the majority of the world population will live in flood prone
   delta cities. Delta City Rotterdam, with one of the biggest ports in the
   world, is dealing with the consequences of climate change in a very
   pro-active and smart way, turning challenges into opportunities. The RCP
   Rotterdam Climate Proof program aims at making the city completely
   climate resilient by 2025, by building multifunctional flood protection
   and innovative water storage for urban drain water. But also by
   kicking-off a Rotterdam Adaptation Strategy RAS, by using new smart
   technologies like Apps and serious gaming, and by redeveloping and
   revitalizing its old city ports areas with attractive waterfronts. At
   these waterfronts, where education of future generations is combined
   with innovative and sustainable development of businesses, best
   practices are showcased to make the city more attractive, to add
   economic value and to create resilient communities. This knowledge and
   experience is shared with other delta and coastal cities in the world,
   in the `Connecting Delta Cities' global network, and with the
   Rockefeller Foundation 100 Resilient Cities initiative. This article
   explains that dealing with climate change in a pro-active and smart way

Title = {Coping with environmental hazards and shocks in Kiribati: Experiences of
   climate change by atoll communities in the Equatorial Pacific},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Small island developing states such as Kiribati in the Equatorial
   Pacific are among the most climate vulnerable places on Earth. While
   there is a considerable body of literature on the scale of the problem,
   there is very little research on the lived experiences of communities,
   their concerns and priorities, and how they are coping with
   environmental and climate hazards. As a result, a top-down approach is
   often adopted in adaptation projects that may not meet the real needs of
   communities, endangering the long-term sustainability and viability of
   interventions. Through a series of participatory focus groups carried
   out in Kiribati in 2019, this study explores what communities prioritise
   and wish to see implemented to cope and build resilience to present and
   foreseeable future challenges. The outcomes of this research show
   environmental risks and hazards faced by communities are strongly
   associated with climate projections. Communities are currently trying to
   adapt to challenges, both old and new, with technologies and materials
   available. While there is a degree of spontaneous adaptation occurring,
   these problems are insurmountable without solving present challenges in
   Kiribati, such as access to better technology and markets without
   becoming over-reliant. Including communities in co-designed
   interventions can also ensure sustainability in climate adaptation
   projects. The findings of this research can inform policy and climate
   change adaptation measures in other similar atoll islands in the
   Pacific.},

Title = {Will population exposure to heat extremes intensify over Southeast Asia
   in a warmer world?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Temperature extremes have increased during the past several decades and
   are expected to intensify under current rapid global warming over
   Southeast Asia (SEA). Exposure to rising temperatures in highly
   vulnerable regions affects populations, ecosystems, and other elements
   that may suffer potential losses. Here, we evaluate changes in
   temperature extremes and future population exposure over SEA at global
   warming levels (GWLs) of 2.0 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C using outputs
   from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Results indicate
   that temperature extreme indices are projected to increase over SEA at
   both GWLs, with more significant magnitudes at 3.0 degrees C. However,
   daily temperature ranges show a decrease. The substantial increase in
   total SEA population exposure to heat extremes from 730 million
   person-days at 2.0 degrees C GWL to 1200 million person-days at 3.0
   degrees C GWL is mostly contributed by the climate change component,
   accounting for 48\%. In addition, if global warming is restricted well
   below 2.0 degrees C, the avoided impacts in population exposure are
   prominent for most regions over SEA with the largest mitigation in the
   Philippines. Aggregate population exposure to impacts is decreased by
   approximately 39\% at 2.0 degrees C GWL, while the interaction component
   effect, which is associated with increased population and climate
   change, would decrease by 53\%. This indicates serious consequences for
   growing populations concurrent with global warming impacts if the
   current fossil-fueled development pathway is adhered to. The present
   study estimates the risks of increased temperature extremes and
   population exposure in a warmer future, and further emphasizes the
   necessity and urgency of implementing climate adaptation and mitigation
   strategies in SEA.},

Title = {Vulnerability to climate change of hypersaline salt marshes in the
   Northern Gulf of California},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {37-50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ecosystem functions and environmental services provided by coastal
   wetlands are threatened by climate change and other anthropogenic
   impacts. Assessing the degree of vulnerability and the nature and extent
   of probable impacts of climate change on coastal wetlands is necessary
   to develop adaptation strategies. Here we review and synthesize existing
   scientific information to examine climate change impacts on physical and
   biotic processes of hypersaline salt marshes in the Northern Gulf of
   California, Mexico. In this region, negative estuaries provide nursery
   and refuge for migratory species and sustain important fisheries. We
   found marshes in the Northern Gulf may be susceptible to the effects
   increased CO2, sea-level rise, storm frequency and intensity, changes in
   ambient temperature, and ocean physical changes, including elevated sea
   temperature, and acidification. The responses of coastal marshes to
   these climate change effects will likely be interactive and hard to
   predict; climatic interannual variability (i.e. El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation) will play an important role in determining the strength and
   directionality of the impacts. Given the uncertainty of climate change
   effects, it will be important to continue ongoing monitoring programs
   and implement new ones that help separate natural variability from the
   effects of climate change. Management actions and adaptation plans will
   be needed that consider uncertainty, are flexible, and encourage ongoing
   learning. Our study is a first step toward understanding vulnerability
   of coastal wetlands in the Northern Gulf of California to climate
   change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {New estimates of direct N2O emissions from Chinese croplands from 1980
   to 2007 using localized emission factors},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3011-3024},
Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas with a large
   radiation intensity and it is emitted mainly from agricultural land.
   Accurate estimates of total direct N2O emissions from croplands on a
   country scale are important for global budgets of anthropogenic sources
   of N2O emissions and for the development of effective mitigation
   strategies. The objectives of this study were to re-estimate direct N2O
   emissions using localized emission factors and a database of
   measurements from Chinese croplands. We obtained N2O emission factors
   for paddy fields (0.41 +/- 0.04 \%) and uplands (1.05 +/- 0.02 \%) from
   a normalization process through cube root transformation of the original
   data. After comparing the results of normalization from the original
   values, Logarithmic and cube root transformations were used because the
   frequency of the original data was not normally distributed. Direct N2O
   emissions from Chinese croplands from 1980 to 2007 were estimated using
   IPCC (2006) guidelines combined with separate localized emission factors
   for paddy fields and upland areas. Direct N2O emissions from paddy
   fields showed little change, increasing by 10.5\% with an annual rate of
   increase of 0.4\% from 32.3 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 35.7 Gg N2O-N in 2007.
   In contrast, emissions from uplands changed dramatically, increasing by
   308\% with an annual rate of 11\% from 68.0 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 278 Gg
   N2O-N in 2007. Total direct N2O emissions from Chinese croplands
   increased by 213\% with an annual rate of 7.6\% from 100 Gg N2O-N in
   1980 to 313 Gg N2O-N in 2007, and were determined mainly by upland
   emissions (accounting for 67.8-88.6\% of total emissions from 1980 to
   2007). Synthetic N fertilizers played a major role in N2O emissions from
   agricultural land, and the magnitude of the contributions to total
   direct N2O emissions made by different amendments was synthetic N
   fertilizer > manure > straw, representing about 78, 15, and 6\% of total
   direct N2O emissions, respectively, between 2000 and 2007. The spatial
   pattern of total N2O emissions in 2007 in China shows that high direct
   N2O emissions occurred mainly in the north and in the Sichuan Basin in
   the southwest. The provinces with the highest emissions were Henan (35.4
   Gg) and Shandong (31.6 Gg) and Tibet had the lowest (0.65 Gg). High
   direct N2O emissions per unit of arable land occurred mainly on the
   North China Plain and the southeast coast. The mean value nationally was
   2.52 kg N ha(-1), with 18 provinces above this value and with emissions
   of >4.0 kg N ha(-1) in Beijing, Tianjin and in Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian
   and Henan provinces.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Natural resource management decisions are often made in the face of
   uncertainty. The question for the decision maker is whether the
   uncertainty is an impediment to the decision and, if so, whether it is
   worth reducing uncertainty before or while implementing actions. Value
   of information (VoI) methods are decision analytical tools to evaluate
   the benefit to the decision maker of resolving uncertainty. These
   methods, however, require quantitative predictions of the outcomes as a
   function of management alternatives and uncertainty, in which
   predictions which may not be available at early stages of decision
   prototyping. Here we describe the first participatory application of a
   new qualitative approach to VoI in an adaptive management workshop for
   Atlantic Coast eastern black rail populations. The eastern black rail is
   a small, cryptic marsh bird that was recently listed as federally
   threatened, with extremely little demographic data available. Workshop
   participants developed conceptual models and nine hypotheses related to
   the effects of habitat management alternatives on black rail demography.
   Here, we describe the qualitative VoI framework, how it was implemented
   in the workshop, and the analysis outcomes, and describe the benefits of
   qualitative VoI in the context of adaptive management and co-production
   of conservation science.},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation programmes are being actively planned and
   implemented around the world, but particularly in places where climate
   change is threatening liveability. Critical adaptation scholars warn
   that adaptation practice largely utilizes techno-managerial and
   market-based approaches which can effectively disempower local
   communities or re-distribute vulnerabilities to the most marginalized.
   To foreground alternatives to mainstream conceptions of `best practice'
   in climate change adaptation, this paper draws upon postdevelopment
   perspectives. We present a theoretical framework to articulate the
   diverse, locally based, everyday adaptation response of local
   communities to climate change. Drawing on a small island in the
   Philippines as a case study, we discuss how community members respond to
   climate change through collective action, reciprocity, and advocacy to
   shape their own adaptation. A range of qualitative methods including
   focus groups, semi-structured interviews and participant observation
   reveal how community members devise their own strategies to exploit
   openings in politics, economy, and knowledge to advance their needs and
   agendas. Rather than relying on business-as-usual adaptation
   trajectories, this paper highlights the importance of diverse,
   spontaneous, and locally driven initiatives in imagining new visions for
   how to respond to climate change in the future.},

Abstract = {Global warming with increasing weather extremes, like heat events, is
   enhancing impacts to public health. This essay focuses on unusual
   extreme summer heat extremes occurring in Germany at higher frequency,
   longer duration, and with new temperature records. Large areas of the
   country are affected, particularly urban settlements, where about 77\%
   of the population lives, which are exposed to multiple inner-city
   threats, such as urban heat islands. Because harm to public health is
   directly released by high ambient air temperatures, local and national
   studies on heat-related morbidity and mortality indicate that vulnerable
   groups such as the elderly population are predominantly threatened with
   heat-related health problems. After the severe mortality impacts of the
   extreme summer heat 2003 in Europe, in 2008, Germany took up the
   National Adaptation Strategy on Climate Change to tackle and manage the
   impacts of weather extremes, for example to protect people's health
   against heat. Public health systems and services need to be better
   prepared to improve resilience to the effects of extreme heat events,
   e.g., by implementing heat health action plans. Both climate protection
   as well as adaptation are necessary in order to be able to respond as
   adequate as possible to the challenges posed by climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the development and results of a model exploring the
   resilience of the Dutch electricity transmission infrastructure to
   extreme weather events. Climate change is anticipated to result in an
   increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events over
   the coming decades. Situated in a low-lying coastal delta, the
   Netherlands may be particularly exposed to certain types of extreme
   weather(-induced) events. The degree to which the country's electricity
   network may prove resilient in the face of these future events is an
   open question.
   The model focuses on two types of extreme events - floods and heat waves
   - and assesses two types of adaptation measures - substation flood
   protections and demand-side management. The model employs a
   network-based approach in assessing infrastructure resilience -
   explicitly representing the structure and properties of the Dutch
   transmission infrastructure - and extends previous work by accounting
   for key power system characteristics such as capacity constraints and
   cascading failures.
   From a practice perspective, the results offer a first indication of the
   vulnerability of the Dutch electricity transmission infrastructure in
   the context of climate change. These results suggest that the network
   displays some vulnerability to both floods and heat waves. Both types of
   adaptation measures tested are found to enhance resilience, though
   substation flood protection shows greater benefits. Whilst the model was
   specifically developed for the study of electricity networks, we
   anticipate that this method may also be applicable to other types of
   transport infrastructures.},

Abstract = {This study advances the state of the art in country-level computable
   general equilibrium analysis for climate change impact and adaptation
   analysis by incorporating forward-looking expectations. The analytic
   framework is used to explore the long-run growth prospects for Egypt in
   a changing climate. Based on a review of existing estimates of climate
   change impacts on agricultural productivity, labour productivity and the
   potential losses due to sea-level rise for the country, the model is
   used to simulate the effects of climate change on aggregate consumption,
   investment and income up to 2050. Available cost estimates for
   adaptation investments are employed to explore adaptation strategies.
   The simulation analysis suggests that in the absence of policy-led
   adaptation investments, real GDP towards the middle of the century will
   be 6.5\% lower than in a hypothetical baseline without climate change. A
   combination of adaptation measures, that include coastal protection
   investments for vulnerable sections along the low-lying Nile delta,
   support for changes in crop management practices and investments to
   raise irrigation efficiency, could reduce the GDP loss in 2050 to around
   2.6\%.
   Further work along these lines for developing countries in climate
   change hotspot regions deserves a high priority on the research agenda
   in economic modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SPRINGERPLUS},

Abstract = {This study investigated the perceptions on and adaptations to climate
   change impacts of 235 pangasius farmers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam.
   Data were collected using semi-structured household surveys in six
   provinces, from three regions along the Mekong river branches. A
   Chi-Square test was used to determine the association between variables,
   and a logit regression model was employed to identify factors correlated
   with farmer's perception and adaptation. Less than half of respondents
   were concerned about climate change and sought suitable adaptation
   measures to alleviate its impacts. Improving information on climate
   change and introducing early warning systems could improve the adaptive
   capacity of pangasius farmers, in particularly for those farmers, who
   were not concerned yet. Farmers relied strongly on technical support
   from government agencies, but farmers in the coastal provinces did not
   express the need for training by these institutions. This contrasting
   result requires further assessment of the effectiveness of adaptation
   measures such as breeding salinity tolerant pangasius.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is broad consensus that adaptation to climate change is necessary
   and urgent. Numerous documents and guidelines are available that provide
   advice on how to incorporate climate hazards and risks into spatial
   policies on the global, European and national scale. The experiences of
   less developed countries have shown that, rather than simply cascading
   uniform procedures, methods and techniques of adaptation down from
   higher to lower levels of governance, a realistic approach calls for
   innovative procedures, tailored to specific circumstances.
   The authors argue that the climate change adaptation (CCA) process in
   developing countries, especially post-socialist transition countries
   with underdeveloped institutions and procedures, differs from that seen
   in developed nations, which calls for taking these diverse (multiple)
   experiences into account when adaptation responses to particular local
   impacts are formulated. In that sense, adaptation is not necessarily
   guided by effective strategies that take into consideration overall
   economic, social and environmental goals, but is, rather, primarily
   intertwined with local spatial planning in an effort to reduce
   vulnerability to climate change and variability. This is mainly a
   reactive endeavour, as it lacks an anticipatory approach, but there are
   nonetheless some innovative qualities in each case that deserve to be
   closely inspected.
   This argument is illustrated by an example from Belgrade, Serbia. The
   Heron Island Project on the Danube River, developed between 2006 and
   2009, aimed to reduce vulnerability to flooding. In the absence of
   climate change adaptation policies and strategies in Serbia, the project
   sought to balance nature preservation with construction and CCA action.
   This demonstrative project can be analysed as an illustration of how
   climate change can be integrated into the planning system, as well as
   what different opportunities are available to incorporate adaptation
   into new and existing developments.},

Abstract = {Some coastal environments facing climate change risks are starting to be
   managed with nature-based solutions (NBS). Strategies based on the
   rehabilitation of green infrastructures in coastal municipalities, such
   as renaturalization of seafronts, are considered adaptive to the effects
   of climate change but may cause misconceptions that could lead to social
   conflicts between the tourist sector and the society. A survey was
   carried out to study user perceptions on the effects of climate change,
   preferences for adaptation strategies, and the assessment of projects of
   dune reconstruction. We find that while beach users recognize the
   benefits of NBS for environmental conservation and storm protection,
   they show little concern about possible effects of climate change on
   recreational activity and have limited understanding about the
   protective capacity of NBS. Thus, a greater effort must be made to
   better explain the effects of climate change and the potential benefits
   of NBS in coastal risk management.},

Abstract = {Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is underutilised in assessing
   Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR) interventions, the
   protocols used are not always rigourous and the analytical framework is
   unclear. However, CBAs which follow best practices could be extremely
   beneficial and helpful to policy makers in establishing priorities for
   Eco-DRR interventions. A robust and systematic economic analytical
   approach might be useful, if not necessary, to justify large upfront
   investments and promote the implementation of this type of risk
   reduction intervention at an even broader scale. Identifying a common
   core of best practices for CBA applied to Eco-DRR would also increase
   comparability between studies, reproducibility of assessments, and
   facilitate much needed external review. The purpose of this chapter is
   to (i) outline the fundamental principles and best practices of
   rigourous cost-benefit analysis (CBA) applied to ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) and (Eco-DRR) interventions; (ii) review existing
   studies; and - based on this review of past work - (iii) outline the
   possible areas of improvement to strengthen future CBAs of Eco-DRR
   projects.},

Abstract = {Coastal fisheries communities in sub-Saharan Africa are under high
   socioeconomic vulnerability in the face of environmental pressures. This
   article contributes to the current adaptation debate by revisiting the
   benefits of in-situ adaptation. We assess possible in-situ adaptation
   strategies amid ongoing vulnerabilities by comparing Ghana and Tanzania.
   A total of 441 household surveys were conducted in four study sites. The
   major findings of the study are as follows: First, the three major
   in-situ adaptation strategies are regular changes of nondestructive
   fisheries techniques, alternative occupations, and collective action.
   Second, all three strategies have a significant relationship with income
   change. Finally, the communities in Tanzania utilized all three
   strategies more and performed better economically than those in Ghana.
   On the basis of these insights, we suggest implications of in-situ
   adaptation for future coastal development in sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {Enhancing resilience is critical for coastal urban systems to cope with
   and minimize flood disaster risks. This issue is certainly more
   important in Africa, where the increase in flood frequency is a
   significant concern for many areas. In this context, urban planners need
   accurate approaches to set up a standard for measuring the resilience to
   floods. In Morocco, this issue is still not fully covered by the
   scientific community despite the obvious need for a new approach adapted
   to local conditions. This study applied a composite index and
   geographic-information-system approach to measure and map resilience to
   floods in three northern coastal municipalities. The approach is also
   based on a linear ranking of resilience parameters, offering a more
   optimal classification of spatial resilience variation. The results
   allowed us to identify specific areas with different resilience levels
   and revealed the relationship between urban dimensions and the flood
   resilience degree. This approach provides an efficient decision-support
   tool to facilitate flood risk management, especially in terms of
   prioritizing protective actions.},

Title = {Valuing the Recreational Benefits of Wetland Adaptation to Climate
   Change: A Trade-off Between Species' Abundance and Diversity},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {550-563},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change will further exacerbate wetland deterioration, especially
   in the Mediterranean region. On the one side, it will accelerate the
   decline in the populations and species of plants and animals, this
   resulting in an impoverishment of biological abundance. On the other
   one, it will also promote biotic homogenization, resulting in a loss of
   species' diversity. In this context, different climate change adaptation
   policies can be designed: those oriented to recovering species'
   abundance and those aimed at restoring species' diversity. Based on the
   awareness that knowledge about visitors' preferences is crucial to
   better inform policy makers and secure wetlands' public use and
   conservation, this paper assesses the recreational benefits of different
   adaptation options through a choice experiment study carried out in
   S'Albufera wetland (Mallorca). Results show that visitors display
   positive preferences for an increase in both species' abundance and
   diversity, although they assign a higher value to the latter, thus
   suggesting a higher social acceptability of policies pursuing wetlands'
   differentiation. This finding acquires special relevance not only for
   adaptation management in wetlands but also for tourism planning, as most
   visitors to S'Albufera are tourists. Thus, given the growing competition
   to attract visitors and the increasing demand for high environmental
   quality and unique experiences, promoting wetlands' differentiation
   could be a good strategy to gain competitive advantage over other
   wetland areas and tourism destinations.},

Title = {Relocation of reef and atoll island communities as an adaptation to
   climate change: learning from experience in Solomon Islands},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN MOBILITY: GLOBAL CHALLENGES TO THE SOCIAL
   SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {81-109},
Abstract = {Projections of sea-level rise generally imply that Pacific low-lying
   reef and atoll islands will be subject to considerable environmental
   changes, gradually diminishing their habitability. As a result, the
   option of abandoning the islands either through increased migration
   and/or relocation has been proposed as a potential adaptation strategy.
   Drawing on insights from Solomon Islands, this chapter explores how
   outlying island communities both historically and recently have engaged
   in human mobilities and partial relocations beyond the islands and in
   what ways these practices form active and deliberate adaptation
   strategies. Based on findings, it is argued that moving people into new
   locations as a response to climate change could have large
   socio-cultural, economic, and environmental consequences, potentially
   creating new vulnerabilities for the communities involved. Thus, any
   required future relocation of communities must be planned carefully, in
   order to select appropriate destinations for resettlement, and to
   guarantee long-term ownership or user rights to land and other resources
   in order to secure people's livelihood opportunities.},

Abstract = {Communities' risk perceptions can influence their abilities to cope with
   coastal hazards such as hurricanes and coastal flooding. Our study
   presents an initial effort to examine the relationship between community
   resilience and risk perception at the county level, through innovative
   construction of aggregate variables. Using the 2012 Gulf Coast Climate
   Change Survey merged with historical hurricane data and community
   resilience indicators, we first apply a spatial statistical model to
   construct a county-level risk perception indicator based on survey
   responses. Next, we employ regression to reveal the relationship between
   contextual hurricane risk factors and community resilience on one hand
   and county-level perceptions of hurricane risks on the other. Results of
   this study are directly applicable in the policymaking domain as many
   hazard mitigation plans and adaptation policies are designed and
   implemented at the county level. Specifically, two major findings stand
   out. First, the contextual hurricane risks represented by peak height of
   storm surge associated with the last hurricane landfall and land area
   exposed to historical storm surge flooding positively affect
   county-level risk perceptions. This indicates that another threat of
   hurricanes-wind risks-needs to be clearly communicated with the public
   and fully incorporated into hazard mitigation plans and adaptation
   policies. Second, two components of community resilience-higher levels
   of economic resilience and community capital-are found to lead to
   heightened perceptions of hurricane risks, which suggests that concerted
   efforts are needed to raise awareness of hurricane risks among counties
   with less economic and community capital.},

Title = {Implementing Ecosystem-Based Management Principles in the Design of a
   Salmon Ocean Ecology Program},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Two decades have passed since the initiation of the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration's research program aimed at advancing the
   understanding of estuary and ocean ecology of United States West Coast
   Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). In this review and prospectus, we
   summarize key findings from this program and describe a plan for
   transitioning it to better support Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM).
   While we focus on salmon research, our approach applies to research
   design generally. Our path forward involves increasing understanding of
   ecosystem processes to improve the dependability of scenario testing
   under novel conditions. Over the past two decades, we developed a
   conceptual model for how climate, predators, prey, fisheries, and human
   activities influence salmon. Knowledge gaps we identified from our
   conceptual model include limited understanding of salmon distributions,
   behavior, maturation dynamics, and population dynamics, and salmon
   interactions with predators, competitors, and prey during winter. We
   consider emerging risks and vulnerabilities facing salmon and propose
   analysis frameworks for evaluating them. Increased predator populations,
   coupled with climate change, pose increasing threats to West Coast
   salmon and will require new strategies and actions to mitigate their
   negative impacts. We propose research to support the development of
   decision-support tools to evaluate tradeoffs associated with alternative
   management strategies and to inform an adaptive ecosystem management
   system to improve the resilience of salmon populations and
   salmon-dependent fisheries.},

Title = {Integrated assessment of sea-level rise adaptation strategies using a
   Bayesian decision network approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {87-100},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The exposure to sea-level rise (SLR) risks emerges as a challenging
   issue in the broader debate about the possible consequences of global
   environmental change for at least four reasons: the potentially serious
   impacts, the very high uncertainty regarding future projections of SLR
   and their effects on the environmental and socio-economic system, the
   multiple scales involved, and the need to take effective management
   decisions in terms of climate change adaptation. Unfortunately,
   mechanistic models generally demonstrated a limited ability to
   characterise in appropriate detail how complex coastal systems and their
   constituent parts may respond to climate change drivers and to possible
   adaptation initiatives. The research reported here develops an
   innovative methodological framework, which integrates different research
   areas participatory and probabilistic modelling, and decision analysis -
   within a coordinated process aimed at decision support. The
   effectiveness of alternative adaptation measures in a lagoon in
   north-east Italy is assessed by means of Bayesian Decision Network (BDN)
   models, developed upon judgments elicited from selected experts. A
   concept map of the system was first developed in a group brainstorming
   context and was later evolved into BDN models, thus providing a
   simplified quantitative structure. Conditional probabilities,
   quantifying the causal links between the direct and indirect
   consequences of SLR on the area of study, are elicited from the experts.
   The proposed methodological framework allows the integrated assessment
   of factors and processes belonging to different domains of knowledge.
   Moreover, it activates an informed and transparent participatory process
   involving disciplinary experts and policy makers, where the main risk
   factors are considered together with the expected effects of the
   adaptation options, with effective treatment and communication of the
   uncertainty pervading the SLR issue. Finally, the framework shows
   potentials for being further developed and applied to consider new
   evidences and/or different adaptation strategies, and it results
   sufficiently flexible to be adopted and effectively reused in other
   similar case studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Coping with climate variability and non-climate stressors in the West
   African Oyster (Crassostrea tulipa) fishery in coastal Ghana},

Abstract = {In Ghana, coastal shell fishery resources, particularly oysters, are
   envisaged to be heavily affected by changes in climate. The potential
   impacts will result from sea level rise, salinity changes and ocean
   acidification. The Whin Estuary, located at longitude 1(0) 48 W and
   latitude 4(0) 56 N of the Western Region of Ghana, is one of the few
   pristine coastal wetlands in the region with live oyster populations and
   a potential for fisheries sustenance. This paper examines adaptation
   strategies to changes in climate among female and male oyster
   collectors, constraints in the choice of adaptation strategies and land
   use stressors affecting the oyster fishery in Ghana. Participatory
   approaches such as participant observation, focus group discussions and
   key informant interviews were used to gather data on the indigenous
   knowledge of the fishery and climate variability. In the fishery, 60 \%
   of female oyster collectors adapt to prolonged dry periods through value
   chain addition practices and 45 \% are practicing other indigenous
   practices. The men adapt to changes in climate mainly by
   diversification. Kendall tau-b correlation analysis performed on
   adaptation practices showed no significant correlation (r = -0.667; p =
   0.174) between the adaptation practices ranked by male and female oyster
   collectors. There was a strong significant correlation (p = 0.05; r =
   0.619) between constraints in the choice of adaptations among fishers.
   Presence of sewage outlets was the major threat (8), followed by
   uncontrolled mangrove cutting (7), sand winning (6) and the least of the
   threats were refuse dumps (4) and farming activities (3) following
   procedures of Battisti et al. (Biodiversity and Conservation 18 (11):
   3053-3060, 2009) and Salafsky et al. (2003) ranking methods. In the
   context of climate variability, female oyster collectors may be more
   resilient in the oyster business than men; hence, they should be well
   resourced through capacity-building training programs. There is need for
   a redress of non-climate stressors by stakeholders through sensitization
   and strengthening of existing bye-laws. Proactive adaptive mechanisms
   blending both indigenous and scientific research-based strategies are
   essential for resilience in the phase of climate variability and
   sustainability of any management decision in fisheries.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal quantification of resilience at the community scale},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {95-107},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Indicators of natural disaster resilience are factors that impact the
   ability to cope with and adapt to a natural disaster and climate change
   events. They can either contribute to or detract from resilience.
   Existing research has emphasized the importance of quantifying
   resilience in order to estimate baseline resilience and measure progress
   toward resilience enhancement. Previous attempts at quantification of
   resilience have not incorporated place-specific indicators or
   differential weighting of indicators for prioritization of resilience
   enhancement actions. Previous research efforts have also not
   incorporated spatial and temporal contexts when attempting to quantify
   resilience indicators. This research demonstrates the importance for
   quantifying resilience place-specific indicators, differential weighting
   of indicators, and the spatial and temporal contexts of indicators for
   resilience estimation and quantification through a case study of
   Sarasota County, Florida. This case study was conducted in four phases:
   preliminary interviews, plan review, focus group, and spatial analysis.
   Preliminary interviews were intended to contribute to development of
   research goals. The plan review process served to identify Sarasota
   County's planning priorities to determine possible indicators of
   resilience unique to Sarasota County as well as existing and planned
   county hazard mitigation strategies. The focus group was concerned with
   identifying resilience indicators through a workshop with officials from
   Sarasota County. The spatial analysis portion used findings from all
   three previous phases to demonstrate spatial patterns of resilience.
   This research demonstrates that although national resilience
   quantification metrics are useful, local scale resilience estimates
   appear more useful if community hazard mitigation and climate change
   adaptation is the primary goal. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Unsustainable development in the Caribbean has reduced the effectiveness
   of coastal ecosystems as ecological buffers against climate variability,
   climate change, extreme weather events, and sea level rise. Using
   Barbados as a case study, the research conducted first examined
   ecosystem degradation. Second, an analysis of adaptation options for
   climate change and rising sea levels was undertaken. Based on the study
   conducted, conclusions were drawn on the implementation challenges of
   adaptation measures and approaches, and areas for future research. The
   research found that hard engineering is highly prioritised because of
   the vulnerability of settlements, infrastructure, and beaches to
   erosion. Beach protection in particular receives significant attention
   because beach tourism is economically significant. Additionally, beach
   nourishment is popular in alleviating erosion. A major finding is that
   reactive and standalone protective efforts are less effective, so that
   hard and soft engineering measures, though economically costly, are
   combined responses. On the other hand, retreat and relocation are
   controversial given limited space, and are economically and politically
   costly.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The IPCC, 2014 report found that the roles institutions played in
   implementing coastal adaptation policies were yet understudied. In
   particular, limited research was done to examine the evolution of
   policies and institutional actions in small island nations. Partly to
   fill this gap, this study traces the historical development of climate
   change policies in Sri Lanka and the critical roles its main climate
   change policy institution played in engaging with the public and
   experts, negotiating with international organizations, and coordinating
   with other stakeholder agencies. We examine how these intensive
   institutional efforts began in March 2008, when, in the midst of rising
   interests in and concerns about global climate change impacts, the Sri
   Lanka Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment (MMD\&E)
   established the Climate Change Secretariat (CCS). In Sri Lanka's
   political history, the establishment of the CCS signalled the dawn of
   the new era, leading to a series of climate change mitigation and
   adaptation policy actions and improved institutional capacity in the
   following decade. CCS's actions in drafting the National Climate Change
   Policy (NCCP) and implementing various coordinated intergovernmental
   programs under the policy demonstrated how a small island nation with
   limited financial and technical capacities could still mobilize domestic
   experts and international financial support to attain some tangible
   results. The CCS also followed international movements for public
   participation by engaging with the public.},

Abstract = {We present a framework for adaptive infrastructure design that can
   properly account for variability and uncertainties associated with
   projected future climatic patterns. Current methods of infrastructure
   design commonly rely upon the assumption of stationarity, implying that
   the statistics of the past climate define future risk. Significant
   changes in climate conditions and event occurrence statistics make this
   assumption invalid. These variations introduce a new level of
   uncertainty that should be included in the design, construction, and
   operation of infrastructure systems. However, current efforts to predict
   the future climate do not provide sufficient and accurate information
   for application to infrastructure design. Due to the uncertainty present
   in the future climate projections, adaptive measures provide the
   greatest potential for cost effective risk mitigation. In this study, we
   provide insight into how to revisit the existing design methods with a
   vision toward embracing climate adaptive methods in engineering
   practice. The proposed adaptable design prevents the higher costs posed
   by other adaptation strategies, such as robust infrastructure, reducing
   overinvestment at the initial stage. A conceptual iterative design
   example is presented to show how the proposed framework can be employed
   for adaptive design of a seawall.},

Abstract = {Agriculture in the Mediterranean basin is currently contributing to
   greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and in the future is expected to be
   strongly affected by climate change. Increasing soil organic carbon
   (SOC) via soil organic matter (SOM) improvement is widely regarded as a
   way to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. Using as a case study
   the Mediterranean coastal area in Spain, which is regarded as one of the
   most intensively managed areas in Europe for orchards and horticultural
   cropping, we analyzed the potential for climate change mitigation of
   introducing different practides that are expected to increase SOC. We
   selected both as a single measure and in cOmbination, cover cropping and
   application to the soil of the available underutilized exogenous organic
   matter (EOM), treated (e.g. composted or digested) or non-treated. These
   practices were compared against a baseline scenario that intended to
   reflect the current practices in the area (e.g. all livestock manure
   produced in the area is applied to the agricultural soil). We carried
   out a modelling exercise at the regional scale using the agricultural
   activity data and current climatic conditions as inputs. Modelling nins
   were performed coupling a widely used dynamic model of SOC turnover
   (RothC) with a model to simulate the GHG emissions from EOM processing
   or storage prior to soil application (SIMSWASTE).
   Results indicate that the most promising practice, considered as a
   single measure and with respect to the baseline, was introducing cover
   crops in woody cropping systems. This practice resulted in an increase
   of 0.44 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years (range 0.41-0.52 Mg
   C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and led to a total SOC accumulation of about 30 Tg C
   after 100 years. Amendment of all agricultural land With available
   underutilized EOM resulted in an increase of up to 0.09 Mg C ha(-1)
   yr(-1) (range 0.07-0.16 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) as a single measure (Urban
   waste) and 0.13 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (range 0.11-0.21 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1))
   as a combined measure (urban waste and composted agroindustry
   by-products), leading to a total SOC accumulation of about 7 Tg C (urban
   waste) and 10 Tg C (urban waste and composted agroindustry by-products)
   after 100 years. Manure anaerobic digestion or composting as a single
   measure did not result in significant SOC changes but, if GHG emissions
   and savings from manure storage and processing management stages are
   considered, they could help to reduce about 4.3 (anaerobic digestion) or
   1.1 Tg CO(2)eq yr(-1) (composting) in the study area, which represents a
   significant amount compared with total agricultural emissions in Spain.

Abstract = {Hunting is a major threat to many species of wildlife. However, managing
   hunting systems to ensure their sustainability requires a thorough
   demographic knowledge about the impact of hunting. Here we develop a
   framework integrating ecological, modelling and sociological data to
   achieve a sustainability assessment of flying-fox hunting in New
   Caledonia and assess the relative merits of alternative management
   policies. Using age-specific stochastic population models, we found that
   the current annual hunting rate {[}5.5-8.5\%] is likely to lead to a
   severe decline (- 79\%) of Pteropus populations over the next 30 years.
   However, a majority of hunters surveyed (60\%) were willing to soften
   their practices, offering an opportunity for adaptive management.
   Recurrent temporary hunting ban (at least 1 year out of 2) in
   combination with protected areas (>= 25\%) appears as the most effective
   and most accepted management option. Our integrative approach appears to
   be a promising method for ensuring that traditional hunting systems can
   remain sustainable in a rapidly changing world.},

Abstract = {Climate change will greatly impact infrastructure and natural resources
   in low-lying coastal zones. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) encompasses
   57,000 hectares on a barrier island that is at high risk of erosion and
   flooding resulting from natural processes and climate change. In 2010
   and 2013/2014, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
   implemented an adaptive management strategy to address the impact of
   increasing erosion on KSC. Two dunes totaling 1.7 kilometers in length
   were created to allow the shoreline to move landward slowly (i.e.,
   managed retreat). The primary reason for building the dunes was to
   protect valuable national assets, but it was also anticipated that the
   dunes would provide habitat for wildlife. Post-construction monitoring
   efforts focused on vegetation and two protected species, Gopherus
   polyphemus (gopher tortoises) and Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris
   (southeastern beach mice). After five years of data collection, we found
   that desired species of vegetation proliferated and non-native species
   decreased over time. Numbers of G. polyphemus and their burrows
   increased steadily. P. polionotus niveiventris began using the dunes
   soon after they were planted and remained resident, based on trapping
   and radiotracking information.
   The created dunes have subsequently withstood two hurricanes and
   exhibited much less damage than the adjacent natural dunes. The use of
   green infrastructure appears to be effective for the simultaneous
   protection of NASA assets and conservation of important wildlife
   habitat. This adaptive management strategy using a managed retreat
   approach is a positive step toward addressing the uncertainty and
   variability of conditions associated with climate change and sea level
   rise.},

Title = {Climate change and risk scenario in Bangladesh},
Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Bangladesh is vulnerable to climate change because of its geographical
   position. Many extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones, drought,
   salinity, hailstorms, river, coastal erosion, etc. affect the country
   almost every year. Although the whole country is affected by extreme
   weather events to different degrees, it is important to categorize the
   zones according to the intensity of impacts from climate-induced losses
   to delineate mitigation and adaptation strategies. To do this in this
   study, we employed the global climate risk index (CRI) with the
   available data at district levels collected by the Bangladesh Bureau of
   Statistics through a national-level survey to estimate the district-wise
   CRI of Bangladesh. Moreover, we employed a time series regression model
   with long-term data collected by the Bangladesh Meteorological
   Department to estimate the variability of climate parameters (such as
   temperature, rainfall, humidity). The yearly increment in maximum
   temperature during 1980-2000 was 0.031 degrees C and it increased by
   0.022 degrees C per year during 2001-2020. The annual rainfall over the
   whole period increased by 223 mm. In general, the overall relative
   humidity increased by 1.16\% between the two periods. There were also
   periodic changes in climate events along with monthly fluctuations in
   temperatures, rainfall and humidity patterns. Among the 64 districts of
   Bangladesh, 4 districts were categorized as severe risk (CRI: > 50), 10
   as high risk (CRI: 36-50), and 12 as medium risk (CRI: 26-35) based on
   climate change impacts. The severe climate risk districts are Sunamganj,
   Bhola, Kurigram and Patuakhali, where there were losses of 520-720
   million USD. In general, 41.71\% of the people were affected by climate
   extremes, and 5.55\% suffered from hazard-induced sickness and injury.
   As a consequence of climate change, flooding showed the greatest
   contribution to household damages and losses in Bangladesh. These
   findings can help in prioritizing region-specific mitigation and
   adaptation actions against the impacts of climate change in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {To cope effectively with the impacts of climate change, people will need
   to change existing practices or behaviours within existing
   social-ecological systems (adaptation) or enact more fundamental changes
   that can alter dominant social-ecological relationships and create new
   systems or futures (transformation). Here we use multilevel network
   modelling to examine how different domains of adaptive capacity-assets,
   flexibility, organization, learning, socio-cognitive constructs and
   agency-are related to adaptive and transformative actions. We find
   evidence consistent with an influence process in which aspects of social
   organization (exposure to others in social networks) encourage both
   adaptive and transformative actions among Papua New Guinean islanders
   experiencing climate change impacts. Adaptive and transformative actions
   are also related to social-ecological network structures between people
   and ecological resources that enable learning and the internalization of
   ecological feedbacks. Agency is also key, yet we show that while
   perceived power may encourage adaptations, it may discourage more
   transformative actions.
   Multilevel network modelling shows that social network exposure promotes
   both adaptive and transformative responses to climate change among Papua
   New Guinean islanders. Different social-ecological network structures
   are associated with adaptation versus transformation.},

Journal = {MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Salinity intrusion is one of the major concerns for the coastal people
   of Bangladesh. The impacts of salinity intrusion on food production of
   coastal districts are likely to severe. Since the extensive shrimp
   farming cultivation started in the 1970s, it has spread throughout the
   coastal region, increasing soil and water salinity levels. A
   mixed-method approach was employed by coupling with SWOT (strength,
   weakness, opportunities and threats) models for identifying alternative
   mitigation strategies of salinity intrusion on food production at
   coastal districts in Bangladesh. A variety of stakeholders and
   policymakers were first interviewed, being asked to participate in an
   exercise identifying their perceptions of the greatest challenges facing
   coastal districts people due to salinity intrusion on food production.
   The study results reveal that large part of the land of coastal
   districts intrude with high salinity and a little part is under moderate
   and low salinity. Therefore, the agricultural land is decreasing and
   shifting into shrimp farming and settlements. The salinity intrusion
   affects the soil surface is to decrease food crop production of the
   study areas about approximately 0.45 metric tons every year. The
   integrating SWOT and TEAM models analysis were shown that the indigenous
   agricultural systems, NGOs activities and community people adaptive
   potency were the strength whereas sensitive environment and absence of
   strict law of environmental management and implication gap of policy
   options were found to be the weaknesses. Foreign aid and research
   results and shrimp export facilities were found to be the main
   opportunities. Land scarcity, food security issues and political
   interventions were found to be the main threats. The SWOT model
   identified several alternatives mitigation strategies for salinity
   intrusion in coastal districts context have been identified which are
   funding opportunities, alternative income generation, sustainable shrimp
   aquaculture, salinity tolerant crop varieties, climate smart agriculture
   and environmental education and research etc. In the end, it is a case
   study that might shed some useful schemes combining scientific
   assessment models such as SWOT and TEAM, which could feed evidence-based
   decision-making processes for generating alternatives mitigation
   strategies of environmental threats.},

Abstract = {Globally, coral reefs are under pressure from climate change, with
   concerning declines in coral abundance observed due to increasing
   cumulative impacts. Active intervention measures that mitigate the
   declines are increasingly being applied to buy time for coral reefs as
   the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. One such mitigation
   strategy is coral restoration based on large-scale coral aquaculture to
   provide stock for reseeding reefs, with the added potential of selecting
   corals that better tolerate environmental stress. Application of
   probiotics during production and deployment, to modulate the naturally
   occurring bacteria associated with corals, may confer health benefits
   such as disease resistance, increased environmental tolerance or
   improved coral nutrition. Here, we briefly describe coral associated
   bacteria and their role in the coral holobiont, identify probiotics
   traits potentially beneficial to coral, and discuss current research
   directions required to develop, test and verify the feasibility for
   probiotics to improve coral aquaculture at industrial scales. Crown

Abstract = {The geographic area of Central Asia is largely arid and semi-arid arid
   very sensitive to environmental perturbations. Recent changes in social
   structures and resource management practices, accompanied by regional
   climate change, have caused substantial environmental concerns. The Aral
   Sea has shrunk by almost 30\% over the past two decades, the flow rate
   of the two major rivers in the region, the Amu Darya arid Syr Darya, has
   been reduced significantly due to overdraws along their courses from
   intensified irrigation and industrial use, soil salinization problems
   have worsened due to increased surface evaporation, snow covers arid
   glaciers have receded due to regional climate change arid thus reduced
   freshwater supplies to the region, and, as a result, the local economy
   has been significantly impacted to the extent that the potential for
   social unrest is a big concern. There is a need to develop new
   technologies to mitigate these environmental problems and at the same
   time there is a critical need to develop adaptation strategies to cope
   with continued environmental change. This chapter outlines at a broad
   scale the environmental issues of the region arid potential
   socioeconomic consequences.},

Title = {Place-based or sector-based adaptation? A case study of municipal and
   fishery policy integration},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-23},
Abstract = {Place-based adaptation planning is an approach to address cross-sectoral
   and multi-level governance concerns as well as to build local adaptive
   capacity in vulnerable resource-dependent communities facing the adverse
   impacts of climate change. In contrast, sector-based adaptation planning
   focuses on addressing climate change impacts on individual economic
   sectors (e.g. fisheries or forestry) or sub-sectors (such as lobsters or
   timber). Yet, linking sectoral approaches with local adaptation policies
   is challenging. More effort is needed to identify opportunities for
   complementary adaptation strategies and policy integration to foster
   multiple benefits. In this article, we use a case study of fishery
   sector resources and municipal adaptation planning in Nova Scotia to
   demonstrate how meaningful entry points could catalyse policy
   integration and lead to co-benefits across multiple levels and
   stakeholder groups. Drawing on a fisheries systems and fish chain
   framework, we identify and assess several entry points for policy
   integration across sector-and place-based adaptation domains within
   coastal habitats, as well as harvesting, processing, and marketing
   sectors. The analysis highlights the multiple benefits of integrating
   local municipal adaptation plans with multi-scale resource sectors
   especially towards monitoring ecosystem changes, protecting essential
   infrastructure, and securing local livelihoods.
   POLICY RELEVANCE
   Climate change is having a growing impact on coastal communities around
   the world, with consequences for sea-level rise, critical habitats,
   essential infrastructure, and multiple economic sectors and industries.
   This Canadian case study demonstrates how municipal adaptation
   initiatives can be complementary to sector-based adaptation at both
   local and regional levels through various entry points across commodity
   production chains. Policy integration across place-based and
   sector-based adaptation processes should lead to multiple benefits such
   as conserving marine biodiversity, protecting essential infrastructure,
   and securing livelihoods. Our analysis, which focuses specifically on
   the fishery sector and coastal communities, shows that these co-benefits
   may arise particularly in such coastal-marine systems and provide policy
   lessons to terrestrial systems and other sectors.},

Abstract = {Egyptian agriculture is vulnerable to potential climate change due to
   its dependence on irrigated crops, a climate that is too dry to support
   crops, and increasing water demands. This study analyzes the
   agricultural implications of climate change and population growth plus
   possible adaptations strategies. A partial equilibrium model that
   simulates crop and livestock production along with water flows and
   non-agricultural water use is used to analyze the impact of climate
   change. The study examines the implications of climate change effects on
   crop yields, livestock performance, non-agricultural water use, water
   supply, irrigation water use, sea level rise and a growing population.
   Results indicate that climate change damages the Egyptian agricultural
   sector and the damages increase over time (2030-2060). Prices for
   agricultural commodities increase and this has a negative effect on
   consumers but a positive effect on producers. Egypt may reduce these
   damages by adapting through lower demand growth, raised agricultural
   technological progress, sea rise protection and water conservation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Scientific research on Urban heat islands (UHI) and urban. overheating
   has set new challenges for societies regarding risk and vulnerabilities,
   energy demands and mitigation strategies to favor urban environmental
   quality conditions against urban pollution. This review manuscript
   addresses systematically 171 relevant studies to identify and
   characterize gaps in the field of knowledge, through a robust evidence
   based analysis focused on identifying taxonomic recurrences, trends in
   the study of urban fields of impact, global leaderships, mitigation
   strategies, methodological divergences, remote sensing indexes, data
   sources, legal frame, among other significant aspects on the context of
   environmental degradation and energy. The results showed that studies
   were carried out in 37 countries and 92 cities, mainly in North America
   (33\%), Europe (31\%), and Asia (27\%) although mainly concentrated in
   five countries (59\%) with an endogenous bias towards domestic
   microscale purposes. Prevailing topics, multidisciplinary interactions
   and regulations are focused on the study of Urban Environmental Quality
   degradation (95\%) and on issues related to Energy (25\%) demand and
   efficiency with applications on land cover with high interest on
   material science, and urban design and planning. The need to implement
   multiscale studies, motivate policies oriented to prevent health
   vulnerability and promote energy safety for urban resilience is
   imperative. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Atoll Island States could still be considered as States. The
   international community has been avoiding any commitment to create a
   convention that would protect people displaced by climate change. In
   order to solve such potential problems, the authors will argue that a
   framework of bilateral agreements, initiatives, and national policies
   could constitute a viable solution for the various interested parties.
   The article will discuss the characteristics of Atoll Island States,
   touching on possible solutions for climate change displacement which
   have been discussed by the governments and civil society of the affected
   States.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies to maintain dunes as flexible coastal flood
   defense in The Netherlands},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {913-928},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coastal dunes play an important role in coastal defense along sandy
   shorelines of the world. The majority of the shorelines experience
   erosion and this erosion is expected to accelerate under anthropogenic
   climate change and subsequent sea level rise. This paper investigates
   the impact of climate change, sea level rise and current management for
   coastal dunes in the Netherlands. Furthermore the paper discusses the
   implications of climate change projections for adaptation strategies
   into the future. Recent climate change scenarios for the Netherlands
   highlight rising temperature and accelerated sea-level rise. Their
   combined effects on dune-building processes are expected to be
   manifested through an increase in erosive forces at the expensive of
   accretive forces. In the Netherlands, a negative sand balance and inland
   migration of the beach-dune system has been successfully counteracted in
   the last decades through the application of sand nourishments. These
   have enhanced accretion on the one hand and limited erosion on the other
   hand. Generally, coastal protection has improved despite rising sea
   levels. Important preconditions that make this sand nourishment strategy
   possible are: a readily available sand resource that makes exploitation
   technically and economically feasible; a sound monitoring system
   supported by solid science; political consensus and a good institutional
   structure to implement the strategy. In the Netherlands, the necessary
   preconditions are already in place to successfully adapt to sea level
   rise. Given the expected accelerated rise in sea level and its potential
   effects on the dune-beach sediment balance, the annual sand nourishment
   will need to be intensified to ensure the preservation and integrity of
   the coastal zone.},

Title = {A PREDICTIVE MODEL TO INFORM ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF DOUBLE-CRESTED
   CORMORANTS AND FISHERIES IN MICHIGAN},
Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {348-376},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The proliferation of double-crested cormorants (DCCOs; Phalacrocorax
   auritus) in North America has raised concerns over their potential
   negative impacts on game, cultured and forage fishes, island and
   terrestrial resources, and other colonial water birds, leading to
   increased public demands to reduce their abundance. By combining fish
   surplus production and bird functional feeding response models, we
   developed a deterministic predictive model representing bird-fish
   interactions to inform an adaptive management process for the control of
   DCCOs in multiple colonies in Michigan. Comparisons of model predictions
   with observations of changes in DCCO numbers under management measures
   implemented from 2004 to 2012 suggested that our relatively simple model
   was able to accurately reconstruct past DCCO population dynamics. These
   comparisons helped discriminate among alternative parameterizations of
   demographic processes that were poorly known, especially site fidelity.
   Using sensitivity analysis, we also identified remaining critical
   uncertainties (mainly in the spatial distributions of fish vs. DCCO
   feeding areas) that can be used to prioritize future research and
   monitoring needs. Model forecasts suggested that continuation of
   existing control efforts would be sufficient to achieve long-term DCCO
   control targets in the state and that DCCO control may be necessary to
   achieve management goals for some DCCO-impacted fisheries in Michigan.
   Finally, our model can be extended by accounting for parametric or
   ecological uncertainty and including more complex assumptions on
   DCCO-fish interactions as part of the adaptive management process.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to climate change, coastal areas are becoming increasingly
   susceptible to more frequent and severe environmental catastrophes that
   endanger the health, safety, and way of life of coastal dwellers.
   Understanding the social perceptions of risk and hazard-related concerns
   can help in the development of adaptive capacity and associated
   management strategy preferences. This study employed structured
   questionnaires to obtain basic information on how the households of the
   Anlo Beach fishing community in the Western region of Ghana perceived
   and responded to coastal hazards. The respondents ranked coastal erosion
   and salinization first and second, ahead of seawater flooding and other
   hazards in terms of important risks in the study area. Responses
   illustrated high levels of knowledge and awareness about coastal hazards
   but low levels of trust in government and commitments in terms of taking
   personal mitigation measures. To varying degrees, respondent
   characteristics such as length of residency and occupancy status are
   positively and significantly associated with coastal hazard perception
   whereas the level of education was negative. Generally, the findings
   illustrated the need for better education and awareness campaigns about
   self-mitigation actions such as discontinuing beach sand utilization and
   exploiting mangroves as firewood, and embracing the restoration of
   mangrove ecosystems. More importantly, the government should reconsider
   her earlier shelved plan of relocating the entire community to a safer
   location.},

Title = {Is Jakarta's New Flood Risk Reduction Strategy Transformational?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {On a conceptual and normative level, the debate around transformation in
   the context of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation has
   been rising sharply over the recent years. Yet, whether and how
   transformation occurs in the messy realities of policy and action, and
   what separates it from other forms of risk reduction, is far from clear.
   Jakarta appears to be the perfect example to study these questions. It
   is amongst the cities with the highest flood risk in the world. Its
   flood hazard is driven by land subsidence, soil sealing, changes in
   river discharge, andincreasinglysea level rise. As all of these trends
   are set to continue, Jakarta's flood hazard is expected to intensify in
   the future. Designing and implementing large-scale risk reduction and
   adaption measures therefore has been a priority of risk practitioners
   and policy-makers at city and national level. Against this background,
   the paper draws on a document analysis and original empirical household
   survey data to review and evaluate current adaptation measures and to
   analyze in how far they describe a path that is transformational from
   previous risk reduction approaches. The results show that the focus is
   clearly on engineering solutions, foremost in the Giant Sea Wall
   project. The project is likely to transform the city's flood hydrology.
   However, it cements rather than transforms the current risk management
   paradigm which gravitates around the goal of controlling flood symptoms,
   rather than addressing their largely anthropogenic root causes. The
   results also show that the planned measures are heavily contested due to
   concerns about ecological impacts, social costs, distributional justice,
   public participation, and long-term effectiveness. On the outlook, the
   results therefore suggest that the more the flood hazard intensifies in
   the future, the deeper a societal debate will be needed about the
   desired pathway in flood risk reduction and overall development
   planningparticularly with regards to the accepted levels of
   transformation, such as partial retreat from the most flood-affected
   areas.},

Title = {Flood risk management approaches and tools for mitigation strategies of
   coastal submersions and preparedness of crisis management in France},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {353-369},
Abstract = {As a consequence of the disastrous Xynthia storm surge on 27-28 February
   2010, France has significantly modified the country's regulations
   related to flood risk management through implementation of the national
   plan for mitigation and management of the flash submersions (Plan
   Submersions Rapides). The paper describes the results of `CRISMA -
   Modelling crisis management for improved action and preparedness', a
   collaborative research and development project co-funded by the European
   Community (2011-2014), which developed a generic framework for
   implementation of simulation-based decision support systems in different
   domains of the natural or industrial risks (floods, snowstorms,
   earthquakes, forest fires, accidental pollutions, mass accidents). In
   particular, the paper addresses the CRISMA-WAVE application of the
   framework regarding simulation of submersion effects at a range of
   temporal and spatial scales, preparedness planning and assessment of
   impacts depending on scenarios based on mitigation options for managing
   the inundation risks in the pilot area, Charente Maritime county. In
   addition, an example of a complex regulatory study implementing a flood
   prevention action programme along the Northern Sea coast in order to
   provide an overall midand long-term intervention strategy regarding the
   combined risk of river floods and marine submersion, making use of
   CRISMA-WAVE methods and tools, is presented. The simulation capacity of
   the platform appears to provide a very good analytic support to find
   negotiated solutions corresponding to a consensus of all the
   stakeholders. The prevention strategy developed for the area is based on
   a solidarity principle between coastal areas and land areas. Adaptation
   of the territory to the increased risks due to the climate change will
   need tens of years to be effective.},

Title = {Indigenous peoples' displacement and jaguar survival in a warming planet},
Journal = {GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Non-technical summary. Climate change threatens tropical forests,
   ecosystem services, and indigenous peoples. The effects of climate
   change will force the San Blas Island communities of the indigenous Guna
   people to relocate to one of the most extensive, intact forests in
   Panama. In this paper, we argue that the impacts of climate change, and
   the proposed resettlement, will synergistically affect the jaguar. As
   apex predators, jaguars are sensitive to landscape change and require
   intact forests with ample prey to survive. Proactively planning for the
   intrinsically related issues of climate change, human displacement, and
   jaguar conservation is a complex but essential management task.
   Technical summary. Tropical rainforest, coastal, and island communities
   are on the front line of increasing temperatures and sea-level rise
   associated with climate change. Future impacts on the interconnectedness
   of biological and cultural diversity (biocultural heritage) remain
   unknown. We review the interplay between the impacts of climate change
   and the displacement of the indigenous Guna people from the San Blas
   Islands, the relocation back to their mainland territory, and the
   implications for jaguar persistence. We highlight one of the most
   significant challenges to using resettlement as an adaptive strategy to
   climate change, securing a location where the Guna livelihoods,
   traditions, and culture may continue without significant change while
   protecting ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity, carbon sequestration,
   and water). We posit that developing management plans that strive to
   meet social needs without sacrificing environmental principles will meet
   these objectives.

Abstract = {Energy system optimization models often incorporate climate change
   impacts to examine different energy futures and draw insights that
   inform policy. However, increased risk of extreme weather events from
   climate change has proven more difficult to model. Here, we present an
   energy system optimization model that incorporates hurricane risks by
   combining storm probabilities with infrastructure fragility curves, and
   demonstrate its utility in the context of Puerto Rico, an island
   territory of the United States that had its energy system severely
   damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017. The model assesses the potential to
   change grid architecture, fuel mix and grid hardening measures
   considering hurricane impacts as well as climate mitigation policies.
   When hurricane trends are included, 2040 electricity cost projections
   increase by 32\% based on historical hurricane frequencies and by 82\%
   for increased hurricane frequencies. Transitioning to renewables and
   natural gas reduces costs and emissions independent of climate
   mitigation policies.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change poses significant emerging risks to biodiversity,
   ecosystem function and associated socioecological systems. Adaptation
   responses must be initiated in parallel with mitigation efforts, but
   resources are limited. As climate risks are not distributed equally
   across taxa, ecosystems and processes, strategic prioritization of
   research that addresses stakeholder-relevant knowledge gaps will
   accelerate effective uptake into adaptation policy and management
   action. After a decade of climate change adaptation research within the
   Australian National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, we
   synthesize the National Adaptation Research Plans for marine,
   terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We identify the key, globally
   relevant priorities for ongoing research relevant to informing
   adaptation policy and environmental management aimed at maximizing the
   resilience of natural ecosystems to climate change. Informed by both
   global literature and an extensive stakeholder consultation across all
   ecosystems, sectors and regions in Australia, involving thousands of
   participants, we suggest 18 priority research topics based on their
   significance, urgency, technical and economic feasibility, existing
   knowledge gaps and potential for cobenefits across multiple sectors.
   These research priorities provide a unified guide for policymakers,
   funding organizations and researchers to strategically direct resources,
   maximize stakeholder uptake of resulting knowledge and minimize the
   impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems. Given the pace of
   climate change, it is imperative that we inform and accelerate
   adaptation progress in all regions around the world.},

   the Mekong Delta},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {228-241},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many coastal areas throughout the world are at risk from sea level rise
   and the increased intensity of extreme events such as storm surge and
   flooding. Simultaneously, many areas are also experiencing significant
   socio-economic challenges associated with rural-urban transitions,
   population growth, and increased consumption resulting from improving
   gross regional product. Within this context we explore the viability of
   proposed adaptation pathways in Soc Trang province, Vietnam-an area of
   the Mekong Delta experiencing cumulative pressures on coastal
   livelihoods. A participatory workshop and interviews, using a
   combination of systems thinking and futures techniques, revealed a
   shared goal of sustainable livelihoods, which provides an integrated and
   systemic focus for coastal adaptation strategies. Emphasizing
   sustainable livelihoods is less likely to lead to maladaptation because
   stakeholders consciously seek to avoid optimizing particular system
   elements at the expense of others-and thus engage in broader
   decision-making frameworks supportive of social-ecological resilience.
   However, the broad ambit required for sustainable livelihoods is not
   supported by governance frameworks that have focused on protective
   strategies (e.g., dyke building, strengthening and raising, to continue
   and expand agriculture and aquaculture production) at the expense of
   developing a diverse suite of adaptation strategies, which may lead to
   path dependencies and an ultimate reduction in adaptive capacity for
   system transformation.},

Title = {Does recent fire activity impact fire-related traits of Pinus halepensis
   Mill. and Pinus sylvestris L. in the French Mediterranean area?},
Journal = {ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Key message Climate change will induce a change in fire frequency in
   Mediterranean region and that could impact fire-adapted plant species.
   We showed that fire-related traits of some pine species are strongly
   related to other factors than fire but the recent fire history has
   nonetheless an impact on the variation of key traits for different fire
   adaptive strategies. Context In fire-prone Mediterranean areas, climate
   change is expected to exacerbate the fire pressure on ecosystems,
   altering the current fire regime and threatening species if they cannot
   acclimate. Aims Studying intraspecific variations of some fire-related
   traits in relation to variation in recent fire activity is thus an
   important step to better understand if this acclimation is possible.
   Methods We measured structural (bark thickness, shoot bulk density,
   self-pruning, leaf surface to volume ratio) and functional (serotiny
   level for Pinus halepensis only) traits in two pines species (Pinus
   halepensis and Pinus sylvestris) commonly found in southeastern France
   and that present different fire-adaptive strategies (resilience vs
   resistance, respectively). Populations were sampled according to
   different fire frequency modalities (0 vs 1 to 2 fires) along a
   geographical gradient, measuring numerous environmental and plant
   characteristics to be used cofactors in the analyses. Results As
   expected, trait variation was strongly linked to environmental and tree
   characteristics as well as to ontogeny overriding the effect of fire
   modalities, even though using integrative models with random effect.
   However, fire modalities had an impact on the variance of some key
   fire-related traits of Pinus halepensis. Conclusion This study will help
   to anticipate the future response of these Mediterranean pine species
   and further underlines the importance of investigating chemical traits,
   flammability, and genetic variation of highly heritable traits, such as
   serotiny.},

Title = {Climate change: Does international research fulfill global demands and
   necessities?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Background Climate change is safe to be one of the biggest challenges of
   mankind. Human activities, especially the combustion of fossil fuels,
   contribute to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and
   thus to the pace of climate change. The effects of climate change are
   already being felt, and the resulting damage will most likely be
   enormous worldwide. Because global impacts vary widely and will lead to
   very different national vulnerability to climate impacts, each country,
   depending on its economic background, has different options to ward off
   negative impacts. Decisions have to be made to mitigate climate
   consequences according to the preparedness and the vulnerability of
   countries against the presumed impacts. This requires a profound
   scientific basis. To provide sound background information, a
   bibliometric study was conducted to present global research on climate
   change using established and specific parameters. Bibliometric standard
   parameters, established socioeconomic values, and climate change
   specific indices were used for the analyses. This allowed us to provide
   an overall picture of the global research pattern not only in terms of
   general aspects, but also in terms of climate change impacts, its
   effects and regional differences. For this purpose, we choose
   representative indices, such as the CO(2)emissions for the
   responsibility of countries, the global climate risk index as a
   combination value for the different types of damage that countries can
   expect, the increase in sea level as a specific parameter as a measure
   of the huge global environmental impacts, and the readiness and
   vulnerability index for the different circumstances of individual
   countries under which climate change will take place. We hope to have
   thus made a comprehensive and representative selection of specific
   parameters that is sufficient to map the global research landscape. We
   have supplemented the methodology accordingly. Results In terms of
   absolute publication numbers, the USA was the leading country, followed
   by the UK, and China in 3rd place. The steep rise in Chinese publication
   numbers over time came into view, while their citation numbers are
   relatively low. Scandinavian countries were leading regarding their
   publication numbers related to CO(2)emission and socioeconomic indices.
   Only three developing countries stand out in all analyses: Costa Rica,
   the Fiji Atoll, and Zimbabwe, although it is here that the climate
   impact will be greatest. A positive correlation between countries'
   preparedness for the impacts of climate change and their publication
   numbers could be shown, while the correlation between countries'
   vulnerability and their publication numbers was negative. Conclusions We
   could show that there exists an inequity between national research
   efforts according to the publication output and the demands and
   necessities of countries related to their socioeconomic status. This
   inequity calls for a rethink, a different approach, and a different
   policy to improve countries' preparedness and mitigation capacity, which
   requires the inclusion of the most affected regions of the world in a
   strengthened international cooperation network.},

   empirical study in coastal Vietnam},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {165-180},
Abstract = {Climate change poses significant threats to the livelihoods of people
   living in coastal areas, especially in the developing world. There is a
   critical need to assess vulnerability to inform both scientific debates
   and policy makers in facilitating adaptation and coping strategies at
   different scales. This study advances existing approaches to assessing
   vulnerability by focusing on both household and collective scales in a
   coastal district in Vietnam: Ngu Hanh Son district. A mixedmethod
   approach was used including 100 household questionnaires, 12 key
   informant interviews and data from direct observations. At household
   scale, results indicate large variation in the degree of vulnerability
   to climate change among households in the same agro-climate zone. These
   differences are attributable to variations in socio-economic household
   characteristics and ability to access livelihood assets. Diversifying
   livelihoods and reducing poverty are important in contributing to the
   resilience of households. At a collective scale, qualitative data
   indicates a lack of multi-directional flows of information and
   highlights gaps in the current governance system. Findings suggest the
   need to bridge the governance gaps and establish an effective
   communication system to reduce collective vulnerability in the district.
   Findings also highlight the need to promote social equity, equality and
   democracy in formulating climate policies in an effort to reduce the
   overall vulnerability to climate change.},

Abstract = {Northern Canada is projected to experience major changes to its climate,

   Some of these, such as mining and oil and gas development, have

   This article reviews how a changing climate will affect several economic
   sectors including the hydroelectric, oil and gas, and mining industries
   as well as infrastructure and transportation, both marine and
   freshwater. Of particular importance to all sectors are projected
   changes in the cryosphere, which will create both problems and

Title = {Adaptive governance to typhoon disasters for coastal sustainability: A
   case study in Guangdong, China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {281-286},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Globally, more people and assets are concentrated on the limited coastal
   plains where they are exposed to frequent disasters, such as typhoons,
   rainstorms and floods that often result in tremendous casualties and
   economic losses. Based on the causal analysis of the historical typhoon
   cases in the Guangdong Province of China, this study indicates that
   structural measures alone are not sufficient to resist and offset the
   impacts caused by typhoon disasters. Additionally, structural measures
   are unsustainable due to their high investment and low security.
   Adaptive governance, which uses non-structural measures and resilience
   building, is a feasible and cost-effective strategy for responding to
   the cascading effects of typhoon disasters. Multi-stakeholder
   participation and vertical-horizontal coordination are essential for
   providing adaptive governance to typhoon disasters. A risk-sharing model
   was put forward by bringing together the government, insurance companies
   and victims. Furthermore, a favorable atmosphere for public
   participation in disaster risk reduction can be fostered and should be a
   long-term adaptation strategy. The views and frameworks of adaptive
   governance provide policy makers with insights on coastal disaster risk
   management within the broader context of climate change. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Climate change leads to a variety of extreme weather conditions such as
   heat waves, unusual cold weather, and heavy rain, which always ends up
   with serious disasters. It could have a tremendous impact on a lot of
   industries in the world. The tourist industry, that plays a vital role
   in the global economy, has faced serious impacts from climate change in
   many tourist attractions, e.g., national parks, mountain areas, and
   beaches. The travel behavior of visitors has been changed under various
   climate change conditions. To understand the influence degrees of
   tourists on climate change factors, this study aimed to analyze whether
   there is difference in the influence of climate change on
   socio-demographic background, travel activities, travel intention, and
   the revisit intention attitude of tourists with different degrees of
   place attachment to Wuling National Forest Recreation Area. This study
   further investigated whether the climate change adaptation strategies
   offered by the park manager would have a positive influence on travel
   intention of tourists. The results of this study showed that except for
   heat waves, events related to climate change such as stronger typhoon,
   heavy rain, unusual cold weather condition, mud sliding, forest fire,
   and the appearance of mosquitos would have a negative influence on
   travel intention, especially for the tourists with a low degree of place
   attachment. In addition, if the park manager offers strategies to adapt
   to climate change conditions, these strategies would have a positive
   influence on travel intention.},

Title = {Environmental non-migration as adaptation in hazard-prone areas:
   Evidence from coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite suffering significantly from the adverse impacts of climate
   change and human-induced hazards, many people at risk deliberately
   choose not to migrate from hazard-prone areas in coastal Bangladesh. As
   many of them encounter significant challenges in maintaining their
   livelihoods, ascertaining how and under what cir-cumstances voluntary
   non-migration decisions occur is crucial. Only a handful of studies have
   investigated whether individuals and groups who decide to stay put in
   the face of climatic hazards consider their decision to be an adaptive
   action. In this regard, this study contributes to the existing
   literature by empirically investigating the voluntary non-migration
   decision as an adaptation strategy through an exploration of the factors
   affecting this decision. We employed a systematic random sampling
   technique and selected 627 respondents from two climatic hazard-prone
   coastal districts: Khulna and Satkhira. Using the Generalized Structural
   Equation Model (GSEM), we found that voluntary non-migrants (84\% of
   total respondents) appeared to enjoy the significant advantage of access
   to their communities' basic need provision and social support.
   Furthermore, the social, psychological, and economic opportunities found
   at their existing location (e.g., better income prospects, affordable
   living costs, receipt of financial help during post-disaster periods,
   and skills allowing them to stay in that location), as well as their
   access to local natural resources, strengthened their social capital and
   thus influenced their desire to stay. Together, these factors enhanced
   people's adaptability to climatic shocks and motivated them to choose
   voluntary non-migration as an adaptation option.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is likely to be one of the most vulnerable countries in the
   world to climate change. This paper discusses the possible impacts of
   climate change in Bangladesh through tropical cyclones, storm surges,
   coastal erosion and back water effect. The possible increase in cyclone
   frequency in the Bay of Bengal, lying south of Bangladesh, due to
   climate change is looked at by analyzing the cyclone data for 119 yr.
   Both qualitative and quantitative discussions are made on cyclone
   intensity increase for a sea surface temperature rise of 2 and 4
   degreesC. Different scenarios of storm surges under different climate
   change conditions are developed by using a numerical model of storm
   surges for the Bay of Bengal. Possible loss of land through beach
   erosion due to sea level rise on the eastern coast of Bangladesh is
   examined. Some discussions are also made on the impacts of back water
   effect due to sea level rise on flood situations in the country.
   Finally, a few remarks are made on the adaptation options for Bangladesh
   in the event of climate change.},

Abstract = {Municipalities of the Languedoc-Roussillon region (South-eastern France)
   are highly vulnerable to climate-change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) due
   to their low altitude and the great attractiveness of the region for
   tourism. This attractiveness has resulted in a very significant
   development of second homes, which represent half of the housing stock
   and three quarters of the total capacity for tourism hospitality. In the
   context of climate change adaptation measures related to SLR, it is
   imperative to consider the perceptions of second-home owners and their
   place in local governance arrangements. Scientists advocate the
   implementation of managed retreat policies to reduce vulnerability by
   reducing the exposure of buildings, but both the social acceptability
   and the economic feasibility of these policies are very low. We assume
   that second-home owners have different perceptions of the risk of
   inundation and are less involved in the governance mechanisms. It is
   very difficult to mobilise a large number of owners of small flats who
   are less concerned with, and less likely to contribute to, policy
   development, due to their less frequent presence. We studied these
   issues through a survey in three municipalities, based on a sample of
   318 residents and 163 second-home owners faced with inundation risk. We
   observed a lower sensitivity to risk and a stronger attachment to homes
   on the part of secondhome owners (compared to residents). We also
   discuss, in terms of equity and efficiency, the impact of their low
   level of engagement in governance mechanisms.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the implications of climate change and urban
   development on the design of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)
   using the example of ponds and raingardens in Auckland, New Zealand.
   Many of Auckland's coastal and freshwater receiving environments have
   been degraded due to stormwater inflows and are potentially at further
   risk due to continued urbanisation and climate change. SUDS have been
   suggested as a possible means of adapting to those risks. However, there
   is little guidance available on how they should be designed for future
   conditions. Response-curves which relate changes in SUDS sizing to both
   climate change and imperviousness are presented as a means of displaying
   a range of possible future design needs. It is suggested that they could
   aid in the selection of adaptation strategies. The methodology followed
   is based on publicly available guidance material to provide a real world
   example of the design issues facing stormwater managers. An incremental
   adaptation strategy, whereby construction is staggered over time, is
   recommended for ponds which vary greatly in size depending on the
   projected climate and imperviousness. In contrast, adapting raingardens
   at the time of construction is pragmatic as the change in size, with
   even the maximum projected climate change, is modest.},

Abstract = {This synthesis is framed within the scope of the Brazilian Benthic
   Coastal Habitat Monitoring Network (ReBentos WG 4: Mangroves and Salt
   Marshes), focusing on papers that examine biodiversity-climate
   interactions as well as human-induced factors including those that
   decrease systemic resilience. The goal is to assess difficulties related
   to the detection of climate and early warning signals from monitoring
   data. We also explored ways to circumvent some of the obstacles
   identified. Exposure and sensitivity of mangrove and salt marsh species
   and ecosystems make them extremely vulnerable to environmental impacts
   and potential indicators of sea level and climate-driven environmental
   change. However, the interpretation of shifts in mangroves and salt
   marsh species and systemic attributes must be scrutinized considering
   local and setting-level energy signature changes; including disturbance
   regime and local stressors, since these vary widely on a regional scale.
   The potential for adaptation and survival in response to climate change
   depends, in addition to the inherent properties of species, on
   contextual processes at the local, landscape, and regional levels that
   support resilience. Regardless of stressor type, because of the
   convergence of social and ecological processes, coastal zones should be
   targeted for anticipatory action to reduce risks and to integrate these
   ecosystems into adaptation strategies. Management must be grounded on
   proactive mitigation and collaborative action based on long-term
   ecosystem-based studies and well-designed monitoring programs that can
   1) provide real-time early warning and 2) close the gap between simple
   correlations that provide weak inferences and process-based approaches
   that can yield increasingly reliable attribution and improved levels of
   anticipation.},

   2007) which are taking into account possible melting of the two main
   continental ice covers (Greenland and Antarctica), estimate
   significantly higher values especially over long periods. Besides the
   problem of sea level rise, also possible general changes in the
   frequency and intensity of storms as well as general changes in the

Volume = {132},
Number = {3},
Pages = {459-473},

Abstract = {Conventional forecast driven approaches to climate change adaptation
   create a cascade of uncertainties that can overwhelm decision makers and
   delay proactive adaptation responses. Robust Decision Making inverts the
   analytical steps associated with forecast-led methodologies, reframing
   adaptation in the context of a specific decision maker's capacities and
   vulnerabilities. In adopting this bottom-up approach, the aim is to
   determine adaptation solutions which are insensitive to uncertainty. Yet
   despite the increased use of the approach in large-scale adaptation
   projects in developed countries, there is little empirical evidence to
   test whether or not it can be successfully applied in developing
   countries. The complex realities of decision making processes, the need
   to combine quantitative data with qualitative understanding and
   competing environmental, socio-economic and political factors all pose
   significant obstacles to adaptation. In developing countries, these
   considerations are particularly relevant and additional pressures exist
   which may limit the uptake and utility of the Robust Decision Making
   approach. In this paper, we investigate the claim that the approach can
   be deemed valuable in developing countries. Challenges and opportunities
   associated with Robust Decision Making, as a heuristic decision
   framework, are discussed with insights from a case study of adapting
   coastal infrastructure to changing environmental risks in South Africa.
   Lessons are extracted about the ability of this framework to improve the
   handling of uncertainty in adaptation decisions in developing countries.},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change put pressure onto environmental and
   natural resources, which in turn increases the vulnerability of
   ecosystems and human communities. This makes social participation
   essential for biodiversity conservation. This article addresses the
   community perceptions of the adaptations made to climate change in the
   El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve (REBIVI), in Baja California Sur (Mexico),
   one of the largest natural protected areas in Latin America. Workshops
   with local communities defined the Socio-ecological Assets for
   Conservation (SEACs) and prioritized the adaptation strategies and
   actions by multicriteria analysis. The conclusions point out that a
   combination of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and communities-based
   adaptation (CbA) is the most appropriate pathway to affront the adverse
   impacts of climate change. Thus, a socioecological approach for land and
   biodiversity use planning has to be implemented if both human welfare
   and conservation are to be effectively promoted. The process is
   necessary and very important, as is the participation of the local
   residents in the implementation and monitoring of the adaptation
   actions.},

Volume = {165},
Pages = {27-35},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To ensure long-term sustainability of the littoral marine ecosystem for
   water-based management and aquaculture potential, it is necessary to
   quantify and project the effect of sea warming on the resident biota.
   This study evaluated the potential of an oyster Suitability Sites
   Occurrence Model (SSOM) to predict the status of littoral areas in the
   future due to sea warming. Data sources comprised Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 7 ETM+. The suitable sites
   were ranked on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 5 (most suitable). In
   the suitability model, score 5 had the highest proportion (35.8\%) of
   oyster suitability which shrank to 16.2\% with a 4 degrees C increase in
   sea temperature. Future increases in sea temperature are likely to cause
   shrinkage in the spatial extent of most suitable and suitable oyster
   sites. Thus changes in marine oyster suitability in littoral zones are
   predicted to worsen gradually as sea temperatures increase in the
   future. Differences in the recorded sea temperature of <= 6 degrees C
   within and between sites may influence spatial variations in oyster
   habitat due to future sea warming. Such concepts could form an
   alternative scientific basis for quantification of potential global
   climate change effects on biodiversity for marine systems policy
   adaptation analysis, aquaculture potential, and management. (C) 2016

Title = {Climate change adaptation with green roofs: Instrument choice and
   facilitating factors in urban areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS},
Abstract = {Although green roofs are considered as a no-regret adaptation measure
   that helps to address various impacts of climate change, they are still
   rather rare. This paper explores three major European cities that have
   policies in place that are supposed to facilitate the installation of
   green roofs. We ask what approaches were chosen by local authorities to
   promote green roofs and which factors facilitated their implementation.
   Our analysis is based on implementation literature in general as well as
   adaptation policy literature in particular. It combines literature
   reviews and eleven interviews with policymakers and other stakeholders.
   The study reveals that immediate threats and particular events (e.g.,
   urban heat islands or floods), an overall social and political
   environment favoring green solutions, so-called change agents, and a
   supportive framing determine if green roofs are considered as an
   attractive solution. However, even when multiple benefits of green roofs
   are beyond doubt, local governments largely prefer fiscal incentives
   over mandatory policies.},

Abstract = {Climate changing is a global threat to the world. There are so many
   reasons behind this problem. One of the major reasons is carbon
   emissions in atmosphere. The causes for this global threat are many,
   among them GHG (green house gas emission) is one of them. Also
   deforestation, land use change, sulfate aerosol and black carbon are the
   other major reason leading to the ozone layer depletion and changing
   climate. Due to the carbon emission atmosphere is being polluted and
   also so many disasters happen routinely. Atmosphere is getting hot day
   by day. Due to this unnatural and sudden temperature rise, glaciers are
   melting, so sudden flash floods occur. Agricultural sector is also
   suffering due to the global warming effects. This will also affect the
   productivity of grains world wide. Climate changing increases land and
   as well as sea temperature and alters precipitation quantity and
   patterns. As a result increasing the global average sea level, risk of
   coastal erosions, etc. climate change will be an added stress for the
   fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Effects will also be severe on coasts
   and marine ecosystems. Extreme events like drought, flood may also
   happen due to these impacts. This paper elaborately present the current
   situation of climate changing and the causes of its vulnerable effects,
   also the mitigation action of climate changing are also discussed. (C)

Abstract = {Agriculture and climate change are internally correlated with each other
   in various aspects, as climate change is the main cause of biotic and
   abiotic stresses, which have adverse effects on the agriculture of a
   region. The land and its agriculture are being affected by climate
   changes in different ways, e.g., variations in annual rainfall, average
   temperature, heat waves, modifications in weeds, pests or microbes,
   global change of atmospheric CO2 or ozone level, and fluctuations in sea
   level. The threat of varying global climate has greatly driven the
   attention of scientists, as these variations are imparting negative
   impact on global crop production and compromising food security
   worldwide. According to some predicted reports, agriculture is
   considered the most endangered activity adversely affected by climate
   changes. To date, food security and ecosystem resilience are the most
   concerning subjects worldwide. Climate-smart agriculture is the only way
   to lower the negative impact of climate variations on crop adaptation,
   before it might affect global crop production drastically. In this
   review paper, we summarize the causes of climate change, stresses
   produced due to climate change, impacts on crops, modern breeding
   technologies, and biotechnological strategies to cope with climate
   change, in order to develop climate resilient crops. Revolutions in
   genetic engineering techniques can also aid in overcoming food security
   issues against extreme environmental conditions, by producing transgenic
   plants.},

Abstract = {In the last few decades, the building evidence that CO(2)e emissions
   lead to climate change has pointed to a need to reduce CO(2)e emissions.
   This research uses five scenarios in the context of UK import trade to
   assess total CO(2)e emissions and costs of import re-routing containers.
   The overall objective is to assess possible carbon mitigation strategies
   for UK supply chains by using a combination of alternative ports and
   revised multimodal strategies. The model adopted includes three
   elements: port expansion, container handling and freight transport. The
   alternative scenarios explore different settings modal shift and short

Title = {Comparison of the Economic Performances of Three Sulphur Oxides
   Emissions Abatement Solutions for a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ship-source air pollutants, especially sulphur oxides (SOx), have a
   major impact on human health, the marine environment and the natural
   resources. Therefore, control of SOx emissions has become a main concern
   in the maritime industry. The International Maritime Organization (IMO)
   has set a global limit on sulphur content of 0.50\% m/m (mass by mass)
   in marine fuels which has entered into effect on 1 January 2020.To
   comply with the sulphur limits, ship owners are facing the need to
   select suitable abatement solutions. The choice of a suitable solution
   is a compromise among many issues, but the economic performance offers
   the basis for which ones are attractive to ship owners. Currently, there
   are three technologically feasible SOx abatement solutions that could be
   used by ships, namely, liquified natural gas (LNG) as a fuel (Solution
   A), scrubbers (Solution B) and low-sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) (Solution C).
   To compare the economic performances of the mentioned three solutions
   for a newbuilding very large crude carrier (VLCC), this paper proposes a
   voyage expenses-based method (VEM). It was found that, within the
   initial target payback period of 6 years, Solution A and C are more
   expensive than Solution B, while Solution C is more competitive than
   Solution A. Five scenarios of target payback years were assumed to
   compare the trends of the three proposed solutions. The results show
   that Solution B maintains its comparative advantage. As the assumed
   target payback years becomes longer, the economy of Solution A gradually
   improves and the economics of Solution B and C gradually decline. A
   comparison between Solution A and C shows 6.5 years is a turning point.
   The advantage of Solution A is prominent after this payback period. In
   addition, the performance of a certain solution in terms of adaptability
   to the IMO greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations is also a factor
   that ship owner need to consider when making decisions. In conclusion,
   when the IMO air pollutant regulations and GHG regulations are
   considered simultaneously, the advantages of using LNG are obvious.},

Title = {Progress or Regress? A Systematic Review on Two Decades of Monitoring
   and Addressing Land Subsidence Hazards in Semarang City},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Land subsidence is a major cause of environmental degradation. It
   increases the exposure of global sea level rise-related disasters in
   coastal cities lying on young sediment. Ample monitoring, adaptation,
   and mitigation measures have been taken to tackle the impact of such
   coastal hazards for decades in Semarang City. However, to date, land
   subsidence still has a negative impact on people's quality of life. This
   brings us to the question of whether the measures are progressing
   towards better management or going to the opposite side. This paper is
   aimed to answer that question through an extensive literature review
   using PRISMA Guidelines to 125 scholarly articles and quantitative
   supporting analysis. We found that land subsidence is overlooked.
   Although the monitoring measures are progressing towards better
   technology utilization, it was not properly integrated into mitigation
   and adaptation measures. Instead of investing more on developing better
   urban water management, groundwater extraction still became the
   preferred water source. Thus, there is a major shift needed with regard
   to urban activities that need to pay more heed to the environment.},

Title = {Tourists' Preferences for Adaptation Measures to Build Climate
   Resilience at Coastal Destinations. Evidence from Cyprus},
Journal = {TOURISM PLANNING \& DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {The tourism sector is recognised as being highly vulnerable to climate
   change, and research is still considered scarce to support destinations
   to enhance resilience capacities. This study aims to analyse tourists'
   preferences for adaptation measures that can be implemented at coastal
   destinations to face climate risks. To this aim, 258 questionnaires were
   completed by tourists visiting Cyprus in the summer of 2019. Tourists
   were posed with hypothetical situations where several climate risks
   occur at the destination, and were asked to choose between alternative
   combinations of policies to counteract these impacts. Results indicate
   that the programs related to beach protection, heat waves amelioration,
   water supply and infectious diseases prevention are the most valued by
   tourists. The study provides recommendations aimed at being useful for
   all coastal destinations, highlighting the importance of climate-related
   preparedness and adaptive capacities to enhance the tourist experience
   value and promote economic impact.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-40},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The management of marine resources is often impeded by a lack of models
   to integrate ecological and economic information on exploited
   populations. We used available biological and economic data for an
   overexploited population of the leopard grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea)
   to study if closing parts of the population to fishing would allow
   sustainable use and maximum economic benefits. Our results suggest that
   fishing should be closed in all spawning areas and in at least 50\% of
   the adjacent areas. High non-consumptive benefits would be achieved with
   large closures because the abundance of the leopard groupers, which is
   an important attribute for SCUBA divers, would increase. In a no-take
   reserve, the welfare gains of divers seemingly could compensate for
   losses incurred by fishers if parts of their fishing grounds are closed.
   An adaptive management scheme could provide a way to incorporate newly
   available information into management decisions for the no-take reserve.

Title = {Climate-Change Sensitive Residential Areas and Their Adaptation
   Capacities by Urban Green Changes: Case Study of Linz, Austria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {141},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As summer air temperatures continue to increase, urban areas will be
   most affected since urban building structures and materials intensify
   the heat island effect. The number of people who will be affected by
   increasing temperatures will rise, especially those in the
   heat-sensitive group of elderly people. Urban planning departments have
   to develop adaptation strategies in order to limit negative effects of
   climate change on their citizens. Due to their climatic ecosystem
   services, urban green areas can play an important role in this process.
   Since the effects of climate change can vary in different urban areas, a
   study was conducted focusing on identification of residential areas most
   affected by climate change according to surface cover structure and
   demographic characteristics in the City of Linz, Austria by using
   satellite images and demographic data. Residential areas with low
   vegetation cover and a high number of risk group members are identified
   as ``climate-change sensitive residential areas (CCSRA).{''} About half
   of the residential areas of Linz and nearly two thirds of the population
   of Linz live in these areas. With selected representatives of these
   CCSRAs, the greening potential was identified and climate adaptive
   strategies developed. A survey carried out in selected CCSRAs showed a
   high appreciation for urban green areas (83.3 to 86.7 percent) by the
   inhabitants but a very low trust (35.0 to 56.7 percent) in their ability
   to contribute to the reduction of thermal load. Most residents would
   support an increase of different types of urban greenery in their
   residential areas (e.g., 76.7 to 91.7 percent would support an increase
   in lawns); at the same time, there is a high rejection of unsealing
   measures (e.g., 38.9 to 57.5 percent reject a lower number of parking
   lots). Greening measures, which would not require a change of surface
   structures such as facade greening, are the least accepted greening
   measures (38.9 to 57.5 percent reject this possibility). In the opinion
   of most inhabitants, residents should decide on the green structure of
   their residential areas (69.4 and 76.7 percent), while only a minority
   would approve of the involvement of urban planners (40.0 to 43.3
   percent) or experts and scientists (16.7 to 30.0 percent) in this
   process. The results show an informational and educational deficit on
   the subject of climate change impact at a local level. The greening
   potential in CCSRAs is still not sufficiently valued by decision-makers
   and inhabitants, and adaptation strategies in the urban development of
   the areas are lacking. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Research on the Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Nunavut, Nunavik,

Volume = {65},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on the human dimensions of climate change (HDCC) in the
   Canadian Arctic has expanded so rapidly over the past decade that we do
   not have a clear grasp of the current state of knowledge or research
   gaps. This lack of clarity has implications for duplication of climate
   policy and research, and it has been identified as a problem by
   communities, scientists, policy makers, and northern organizations. Our
   review of current knowledge about the HDCC in Nunavut, Nunavik, and
   Nunatsiavut indicates that the effects of climate change on subsistence
   harvesting and other land-based activities and the determinants of
   vulnerability and adaptation to such changes are well understood.
   However, the effects of climate change on health are less known. In the
   nascent research on this topic, studies on food security and personal
   safety dominate, and little peer-reviewed scholarship focuses on the
   business and economic sector. Published research shows a strong bias
   toward case studies in smaller communities, especially communities in
   Nunavut. Such studies have focused primarily on negative impacts of
   climate change, present-day vulnerabilities, and adaptive capacity, but
   studies proposing opportunities for adaptation intervention are
   beginning to emerge. While documenting the serious risks posed by
   climate change, they also highlight the adaptability of northern
   populations and the effects of economic-political stresses on
   vulnerability to changing climate. We note the absence of studies that
   examine how Northerners can benefit from new opportunities that may
   arise from climate change, or assess how the interaction of future
   climatic and socio-economic changes (specifically, resource development
   and enhanced shipping) will affect their experience of and response to
   climate change, or discuss the broader determinants of vulnerability and
   adaptation.},

Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},

Abstract = {In this study, we extend the global-scale Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
   (SSPs) to develop local SSPs as a tool to inform adaptation decisions (a
   so-called `climate service') for the city of Flensburg, Germany.
   Flensburg experiences regular coastal flooding during storm events,
   which is expected to increase with sea-level rise (SLR). To develop
   robust adaptation strategies under the uncertainties of future SLR and
   socioeconomic development in the city, local socioeconomic scenarios can
   help explore plausible future socioeconomic conditions and how these
   conditions drive adaptation strategies. We employ a multi-scale
   co-production approach for developing such local scenarios. Using the
   global SSPs as boundary conditions, we construct local SSP narratives
   based on local SSP elements that we compile during the process. We
   integrate local stakeholder knowledge into the local SSPs in an
   iterative manner with the help of focus group discussions, a scenario
   workshop, and email feedback. This process results in four local SSP
   narratives that explore alternative trends in socioeconomic development
   in Flensburg and are embedded in developments at national to global
   scales. Due to their local relevance, the extended local SSPs can serve
   as a climate service to support Flensburg in developing adaptation plans
   to cope with the future impacts of SLR.},

   multi-level assessment of historical and current developments},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS), including bioenergy with carbon
   capture and storage (BECCS), could contribute to climate change
   mitigation strategies. However, the 2020s is not the first time that CCS
   is high on the agenda. This study explores the differences between the
   past and current developments of CCS and discusses how incumbent actors'
   experiences can inform the understanding of potential future energy
   system transitions in Sweden. For this purpose, a multi-level
   perspective (MLP) analysis was conducted based on documents, interviews
   and focus groups with key actors. Since the 2000s, increased urgency of
   climate change has further pushed policy makers into action. In
   addition, there is a new framing of CCS that underscores the potential
   of BECCS to provide negative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as
   prospects for offshore storage of CO2 in Norway and other territories.
   As such, this study shows that Sweden could be on a transformation
   pathway towards implementing CCS alongside other mitigation measures.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {5},
Pages = {640-649},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pervasive salinity in soil and water is affecting agricultural yield and
   the health of millions of delta dwellers in Asia. This is also being
   exacerbated by climate change through increases in sea level and
   tropical storm surges. One consequence of this has been a widespread
   introduction of salt water shrimp farming. Here, we show, using field
   data and modeling, how changes in climate and land use are likely to
   result in increased salinization of shallow groundwater in SE Asian
   mega-deltas. We also explore possible adaptation options. We find that
   possible future increase of episodic inundation events, combined with
   salt water shrimp farming, will cause rapid salinization of groundwater
   in the region making it less suitable for drinking water and irrigation.
   However, modified land use and water management practices can mitigate
   the impacts on groundwater, as well as the overlying soil, from future
   salinization. The study therefore provides guidance for adaptation
   planning to reduce future salinization in Asian deltas.},

   comparison of policy and practice in Manila and Vancouver},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {253},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {`Managed retreat' is gaining considerable attention as part of
   megacities' climate change adaptation and resilience enhancement
   toolkits, and as a policy option for disaster risk reduction in coastal
   regions. The overarching objective of managed retreat is to reduce the
   exposure of people and assets to flooding, storm surges and sea level
   rise by retreating from these threats in a planned fashion. Managed
   retreat is one of four main options covered in the TARA'
   (protect/accommodate/retreat/avoid) framework explained in this paper,
   which can be used to enhance resilience in coastal megacities. In this
   paper, qualitative research methods were used to collect primary data on
   the feasibility of using managed retreat for two case study coastal
   megacities: Manila, Philippines, and Vancouver, Canada. Both case
   studies review the risk context of each city, local climate change
   adaptation/disaster risk reduction (CCA/DRR) policies linked to managed
   retreat, examples of managed retreat practice, and barriers to managed
   retreat identified through primary or secondary data analysis.
   Comparisons between the two cases are then carried out, and similarities
   and differences are highlighted. The paper concludes by suggesting
   possible means by which barriers to managed retreat might be overcome.},

Abstract = {Since the implementation of economic reforms in 1986, the Mekong Delta
   has experienced an extensive transformation process in its agricultural
   sector. This transformation has been characterized by agricultural
   intensification, the enhanced use of agrichemicals (fertilizer,
   pesticides), and emerging concerns for human health and the environment.
   The predicted impacts of climate change such as sea level rise, greater
   seasonal variability in precipitation and river flows, and elevated
   temperature and CO(2) concentration will all likely also influence the
   agricultural landscape and thus agrichemical use. Against the background
   of the anticipated climate change impacts in the Mekong Delta, this
   chapter aims to draw a scenario for future agrichemical use and
   attendant environmental problems. This scenario is achieved through a
   review of the main climate change-mediated drivers for agrichemical use,
   with a focus on land-use changes and changes in pest and disease
   patterns. In addition, the chapter identifies possible adaptation
   measures that may be implemented by the agricultural sector in the
   Mekong Delta and explores the potential environmental effects of these
   adaptation strategies.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Operationalizing resilience in fisheries management is a challenging
   issue in the face of global changes. In this perspective, Grafton et al.
   (2019) propose a heuristic based on the `3Rs' of resilience, namely
   resistance, recovery, and robustness. The work presented here applies
   this generic framework to the coastal fishery of French Guiana, which is
   under pressure because of both climate change, energy costs and
   demographic growth. To this end, a dynamic multi-species, resource-based
   and multi-fleet model accounting for climate and socio-economic
   uncertainties is developed and calibrated using catch and effort time
   series. The search for a more resilient management leads us to compare
   different fishing management strategies and projections including
   `Business as usual' (BAU), `Multispecies Maximum Sustainable Yield'
   (MMSY) and `Multispecies Maximum Economic Yield' (MMEY) strategies. The
   comparison between the strategies relies on ecological-economic
   viability goals and thresholds. The two normative strategies MMSY and
   MMEY turn out to provide major gains in terms of the 3Rs and
   ecological-economic resilience as compared to BAU. They both suggest
   major redistributions in the fishing effort of the different fleets. (c)

Abstract = {The underpinned study examines the effects of climatic and non-climatic
   factors on Indian agriculture, cereal production, and yield using the
   country-level time series data of 1965-2015. With the autoregressive
   distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach, the long-term
   equilibrium association among the variables has been explored. The
   results reveal that climatic factors like CO2 emissions and temperature
   adversely affect agricultural output, while rainfall positively affects
   it. Likewise, non-climatic factors, including energy used, financial
   development, and labor force, affect agricultural production positively
   in the long run. The estimated long-run results further demonstrate that
   CO2 emissions and rainfall positively affect both cereal production and
   yield, while temperature adversely affects them. The results exhibit
   that the cereal cropped area, energy used, financial development, and
   labor force significantly and positively impact the long-run cereal
   production and yield. Finally, pairwise Granger causality test confirmed
   that both climatic and non-climatic factors are significantly
   influencing agriculture and cereal production in India. Based on these
   results, policymakers and governmental institutions should formulate
   coherent adaptation measures and mitigation policies to tackle the
   adverse climate change effects on agriculture and its production of
   cereals.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The objective of the analysis is to compare the current status of state
   level climate change adaptation plans across the United States (U.S.)
   and to analyze potential factors that may influence their status. Based
   on their most current adaptation planning documentation individual
   states are grouped into four categories depending on how far they are in
   their approach towards adaptation to predicted changes in climate and
   how they have progressed with their planning efforts in defining
   adaptation measures. The analysis of the state adaptation plans showed
   that 13 states had detailed sector specific actions recommended, 2
   states had sector specific targets and recommendation, 14 states had
   expressed concern and need for adaptation planning, whereas 21 states
   did not mention the need for adaptation planning. The statistical
   analysis showed that Democratic Party popular votes are 10 \% higher in
   states with detailed sector specific actions recommended in comparison
   to states with no mention of adaptation planning (p < 0.01). The average
   gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in states having an adaptation
   planning status with detailed sector specific actions recommended is
   more than \$6,000 higher compared to states with expressed concern and
   need for adaptation planning and states with no mention of adaptation
   planning (p < 0.05). The average coastal population in states with
   detailed sector specific actions recommended is more than seven times
   higher compared to states with expressed concern and states with no
   mention of adaptation planning (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the U.S.
   state planning initiatives will need to strengthen their approach to
   adaptation planning substantially to have holistic and more coordinated
   adaptation planning efforts.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses unprecedented challenges for fisheries management
   systems. Increased environmental variability and uncertainty due to
   climate change are creating shifts in productivity and distribution of
   fished species, and subsequent social-ecological impacts that require
   timely implementation of adaptive management strategies. Yet many
   proposed ``climate-ready{''} fisheries actions - such as integrating
   climate factors into stock assessments and increasing flexibility in
   decision-making - either complicate or add to existing responsibilities
   of fishery managers and strain existing institutions. In the United
   States, many fisheries management agencies have explicitly acknowledged
   certain capacity shortfalls and institutional limitations to addressing
   current and projected impacts of climate change on marine fisheries.
   Many resource and capacity gaps across the adaptive fisheries management
   cycle could be filled through more effective fishery partnerships among
   management agencies, fishing industries, private sector, and academia.
   Partnership approaches are key to unlocking capacity for achieving
   climate-ready fisheries yet expanded implementation may require a shift
   towards a model that empowers and obligates fishery stakeholders to take
   on expanded roles with appropriate guidelines and oversight, while
   establishing increased roles for agencies as facilitators and auditors
   for certain tasks. Building and institutionalizing more effective
   fishery partnerships to achieve climate-ready fisheries will require
   clear guidance and enabling conditions.},

Abstract = {The present special issue discusses three significant challenges of the
   built environment, namely regional and global climate change,
   vulnerability, and survivability under the changing climate. Synergies
   between local climate change, energy consumption of buildings and energy
   poverty, and health risks highlight the necessity to develop mitigation
   strategies to counterbalance overheating impacts. The studies presented
   here assess the underlying issues related to urban overheating. Further,
   the impacts of temperature extremes on the low-income population and
   increased morbidity and mortality have been discussed. The increasing
   intensity, duration, and frequency of heatwaves due to human-caused
   climate change is shown to affect underserved populations. Thus, housing
   policies on resident exposure to intra-urban heat have been assessed.
   Finally, opportunities to mitigate urban overheating have been proposed
   and discussed.},

Title = {Evaluating adaptation options for urban flooding based on new high-end
   emission scenario regional climate model simulations},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-84},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation studies on urban flooding are often based on a
   model chain approach from climate forcing scenarios to analysis of
   adaptation measures. Previous analyses of climate change impacts in
   Copenhagen, Denmark, were supplemented by 2 high-end scenario
   simulations. These include a regional climate model projection forced to
   a global temperature increase of 6 degrees C in 2100 as well as a
   projection based on a high radiative forcing scenario (RCP8.5). With
   these scenarios, projected impacts of extreme precipitation increase
   significantly. For extreme sea surges, the impacts do not seem to change
   substantially compared to currently applied projections. The flood risk
   (in terms of expected annual damage, EAD) from sea surge is likely to
   increase by more than 2 orders of magnitude in 2100 compared to the
   present cost. The risk from pluvial flooding in 2000 is likely to
   increase by almost 4 and 8 times the current EAD for the RCP8.5 and 6
   degrees C scenario, respectively. For both hazards, business-as-usual is
   not a possible scenario, since even in the absence of policy-driven
   changes, significant autonomous adaptation is likely to occur.
   Copenhagen has developed an adaptation plan to pluvial flooding that
   makes the urban areas more robust and reduces the risk of flooding under
   the current climate to a very low level. The reduction in flood risk for
   the A1B scenario is substantial (corresponding to 0.2-0.3 times the
   current EAD in 2100), and even in the high-end scenarios, the risk is
   significantly reduced (corresponding to 0.6-1.0 and 1.2-2.1 times the
   current EAD for the RCP8.5 and 6 degrees C scenario, respectively).},

Title = {Alaskan wild food harvester information needs and climate adaptation
   strategies},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Changing biophysical conditions due to amplified climate change in
   northern latitudes has significant implications for species' habitat and
   populations and can dramatically alter interactions between harvesters
   and local resources. Tribal, regional, and state governments, federal
   agencies, and other local planning entities have begun documenting
   observations of changing harvest conditions and the information
   necessary for communities to adapt to shifting resource availability. We
   identify and evaluate what stakeholders are saying about wild foods in
   the context of climate change information needs in Alaska through a
   review of published grey literature (n = 87). Documents consistently
   expressed that climate change was impacting habitat conditions, resource
   distribution, and the abundance of wild foods. They solicited more
   information on biophysical processes (e.g., sea ice conditions) and
   population-level responses (e.g., shift in migration patterns). They
   also recommended that future projects focus on information that will
   improve food security, travel access, and community well-being.
   Documents suggested that communities have successfully sustained harvest
   practices, but most current adaptations are localized decisions being
   made by harvesters to manage the risks of current climate change.
   Strategies include finding new areas to hunt, substituting harvest
   species with other wild foods, or using new modes of travel. Documents
   also identified several adaptation strategies that still need to be
   implemented, and are dependent on actions by actors at larger scales;
   these strategies include legal, policy, and management actions to help
   reduce climate change impacts to wild food harvest. This review of the
   grey literature complements the climate-change literature by describing
   information needs of Alaskan wild food harvesters as well as providing
   tangible suggestions about how to improve adaptation and management
   strategies for harvesters grappling with changing resource conditions in
   the Arctic.},

Abstract = {The rice-shrimp farming system is considered as a sustainable and
   beneficial model for the environment. However, the area of rice-shrimp
   was increasingly narrowed due to the trend of converting from rice to
   aquaculture by economic reasons. This paper aims to propose a medium
   scale land use change model for understanding the land use decision of
   farmers in adaptation to the environment and climate change. The model
   integrates a land-use decision making process based on multi-criteria
   selection where the main factors are land suitability, land
   convertibility, land use situation of neighbors, and profitability of
   land use patterns. Concerning the land use data, we used historical land
   use map in 2005, 2015 and 2019. Shrimp cultivation regions was completed
   by Landsat satellite image processing. The model has been calibrated by
   rice-shrimp map in 2015 and has been verified with the rice - shrimp map
   in 2019 of the My Xuyen district, Soc Trang province, Vietnam. The
   simulated results show that the rice-shrimp area was increasingly
   narrowed and has been converted to aquaculture land. In addition, the
   model tends to show that in a scenario of sea level rise of 15 cm in
   2030, the share of rice-shrimp and shrimp tends to rise sharply, which
   is an important lesson for developing complex adaptive strategies of
   farmers.},

Title = {Heat Vulnerability and Heat Island Mitigation in the United States},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Heat waves are the deadliest type of natural hazard among all weather
   extremes in the United States. Given the observed and anticipated
   increase in heat risks associated with ongoing climate change, this
   study examines community vulnerability to extreme heat and the degree to
   which heat island mitigation (HIM) actions by state/local governments
   reduce heat-induced fatalities. The analysis uses all heat events that
   occurred over the 1996-2011 period for all United States counties to
   model heat vulnerability. Results show that: (1) Higher income reduces
   extreme heat vulnerability, while poverty intensifies it; (2) living in
   mobile homes or rental homes heightens susceptibility to extreme heat;
   (3) increased heat vulnerability due to the growth of the elderly
   population is predicted to result in a two-fold increase in heat-related
   fatalities by 2030; and (4) community heat island mitigation measures
   reduce heat intensities and thus heat-related fatalities. Findings also
   show that an additional locally implemented measure reduces the annual
   death rate by 15\%. A falsification test rules out the possibility of
   spurious inference on the life-saving role of heat island mitigation
   measures. Overall, these findings inform efforts to protect the most
   vulnerable population subgroups and guide future policies to counteract
   the growing risk of deadly heat waves.},

Title = {Biological invasions, ecological resilience and adaptive governance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In a world of increasing interconnections in global trade as well as
   rapid change in climate and land cover, the accelerating introduction
   and spread of invasive species is a critical concern due to associated
   negative social and ecological impacts, both real and perceived. Much of
   the societal response to invasive species to date has been associated
   with negative economic consequences of invasions. This response has
   shaped a war-like approach to addressing invasions, one with an agenda
   of eradications and intense ecological restoration efforts towards prior
   or more desirable ecological regimes. This trajectory often ignores the
   concept of ecological resilience and associated approaches of
   resilience-based governance. We argue that the relationship between
   ecological resilience and invasive species has been understudied to the
   detriment of attempts to govern invasions, and that most management
   actions fail, primarily because they do not incorporate adaptive,
   learning-based approaches. Invasive species can decrease resilience by
   reducing the biodiversity that underpins ecological functions and
   processes, making ecosystems more prone to regime shifts. However,
   invasions do not always result in a shift to an alternative regime;
   invasions can also increase resilience by introducing novelty, replacing
   lost ecological functions or adding redundancy that strengthens already
   existing structures and processes in an ecosystem. This paper examines
   the potential impacts of species invasions on the resilience of
   ecosystems and suggests that resilience-based approaches can inform
   policy by linking the governance of biological invasions to the
   negotiation of tradeoffs between ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Published

Title = {Managed Retreat as Adaptation Option: Investigating Different
   Resettlement Approaches and Their Impacts-Lessons from Metro Manila},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Managed retreat has become a recommended adaptation strategy for
   hazard-prone coastal cities. The study aimed to improve considerations
   for the contextual factors that influence the success of managed retreat
   and resettlement projects in Metro Manila. Data were collected through a
   mixed-method approach consisting of a screening of relevant literature,
   a qualitative case analysis of resettlement projects, and a workshop
   series with Philippine stakeholders. It turned out that the resettlement
   of informal settlers is a central element of urban development. Though
   in-city resettlement is preferred, the majority of existing and planned
   projects are developed in off-city locations. The findings present a
   nuanced view of different retreat approaches. Not all in-city
   resettlements are successful, and the unpopular off-city projects have a
   potentially important role for urban and regional development. A
   strategic planning thread to develop concepts for qualitative off-city
   settlements that counteract uncontrolled urban sprawl with
   monofunctional residential areas for urban poor people was deduced. The
   other thread asks for pathways for inner-city development with
   innovative, vertical, in-city projects. A final observation was that
   climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic are worsening the situation in
   informal settlements, thus strengthening the argument for the planned
   decentralization of Metro Manila's congested urban areas.},

   integrating health in climate change adaptation and mitigation},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH \& PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives: Human-generated climate change is causing adverse health
   effects through multiple direct pathways (e.g. heatwaves, sea-level
   rise, storm frequency and intensity) and indirect pathways (e.g. food
   and water insecurity, social instability). Although the health system
   has a key role to play in addressing these health effects, so too do
   those professions tasked with the development of the built environment
   (urban and regional planners, urban designers, landscapers and
   architects), through improvements to buildings, streets, neighbourhoods,
   suburbs and cities. This article reports on the ways in which urban
   planning and design, and architectural interventions, can address the
   health effects of climate change; and the scope of climate change
   adaptation and mitigation approaches being implemented by the built
   environment professions.
   Type of program or service: Built environment adaptations and
   mitigations and their connections to the ways in which urban planning,
   urban design and architectural practices are addressing the health
   effects of climate change.
   Methods: Our reflections draw on the findings of a recent review of
   existing health and planning literature. First, we explore the ways in
   which `adaptation' and `mitigation' relate to the notion of human and
   planetary health. We then outline the broad scope of adaptation and
   mitigation interventions being envisioned, and in some instances
   actioned, by built environment professionals.
   Results: Analysis of the review's findings reveals that adaptations
   developed by built environment professions predominantly focus on
   protecting human health and wellbeing from the effects of climate
   change. In contrast, built environment mitigations address climate
   change by embracing a deeper understanding of the co-benefits inherent
   in the interconnectedness of human health and wellbeing and the health
   of the ecosystem on which it depends. In the final section, we highlight
   the ethical transition that these approaches demand of built environment
   professions.
   Lessons learnt: Built environment interventions must move beyond simple
   ecological sustainability to encouraging ways of life that are healthy
   for both humans and the planet. There are key challenges facing this new
   approach.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) poses significant threats to northeast and
   mid-Atlantic Tribal Nations' climate and water justice. Existing SLR
   adaptation frameworks do not include Indigenous knowledge. Furthermore,
   SLR adaptation policy prioritizes economic and property rights and is
   misaligned with Indigenous coastal protection priorities. If Tribal
   Nations are to respond effectively to SLR then adaptation frameworks
   must be designed and developed by Indigenous Peoples for Indigenous
   Peoples. Eastern coastal Tribal Nations have a unique history of
   survival and resilience despite settler-colonial expansion in the
   northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of what is currently referred to as
   the United States. Experiences of eastern Atlantic coastal Tribal
   Nations highlight innovative response strategies for SLR adaptation and
   coastal stewardship practices not reflected in existing adaptation
   frameworks for the region. Indigenist SLR adaptation frameworks that
   utilize Indigenous knowledge are needed to combat water security issues
   resulting from SLR risks such as flooding, saltwater intrusion, storm
   surge, and erosion. This article proposes the WAMPUM adaptation
   framework informed by northeastern and mid-Atlantic coastal Tribal
   Nation science and knowledge systems for climate change adaptation to
   SLR.},

Title = {`Climate portfolio' of Pichavaram mangrove region of Tamil Nadu coast,
   India: an add-on information for adaptation policy planning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {The lack of comprehensive information on the climate of the coastal
   region results in insufficient understanding of the impact of changing
   climate on the coastal ecosystems and also impedes in framing suitable
   climate-based adaptation strategies and policies at the regional and
   local level. Monitoring current climate change demands a historical
   perspective, as much as possible, and framing a baseline climate data is
   important for establishing a reference point to assess climate change.
   Thus, the study of past climate change relies critically on the
   availability of datasets that characterize the climate of the region. In
   this context, the objective of this article is to provide climate
   portfolio (collection of climate information) of Pichavaram mangrove
   region of Tamil Nadu coast, India, and to give an outline of its
   predicted impacts. Climate data of the past 60 years have been
   collected, and the trend analysis of major climatic variables such as
   temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and wind speed has been studied
   statistically. This research article critically appraises the available
   climate data, identifies general patterns of climate change in the
   coastal region and highlights the gaps in existing knowledge on the
   impact of climate change at the local level. It gives a holistic
   approach on understanding climate at local level and provides baseline
   climate information. This, in turn, is expected to shore up in framing
   suitable adaptation strategies and policies for the coastal region with
   the most valuable ecosystem such as mangroves.},

Abstract = {It envinces that sea level rise aggravates low-lying terrain inundation,
   storm surges, beach erosion, and other ecological damages. The developed
   agricultural system in the Pearl River Delta is at a high risk to
   floods; and, in light of the tactical significance of the Guangdong-Hong
   Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and its high vulnerability to sea level rise
   and storm surges, it urgently requires to study their impacts on the
   agricultural areas in this region.
   Taking Nansha District, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, China as the
   study area, this study builds a vulnerability evaluation model of
   agricultural areas with the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence
   framework using an indicator system upon exposure, sensibility, and
   adaptation, and quantitatively predicts the inundation risk level,
   financial loss, and vulnerability patterns of varied scenarios of sea
   level rise superimposed with storm surges with the ArcGIS. The main
   findings include lithe stimulated proportion of inundated areas in
   minimum-risk and maximum-risk scenarios is 73.38\% and 87.96\%
   respectively, and the estimated financial loss in both scenarios is RMB
   3,897.3855 million and 7,160.4979 million, respectively; 21 the central
   Nansha will suffer from a higher inundation risk, and the northern and
   southern agriculatural parts within the study area have a higher
   vulnerability to flood disasters. Resilience strategies-through defense,
   adaptation, or relocation-for each vulnerable zone are then proposed
   accordingly.},

Title = {Do the Adaptations of Venice and Miami to Sea Level Rise Offer Lessons
   for Other Vulnerable Coastal Cities?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {391-415},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Both Venice and Miami are high-density coastal cities that are extremely
   vulnerable to rising sea levels and climate change. Aside from their
   sea-level location, they are both characterized by large populations,
   valuable infrastructure and real estate, and economic dependence on
   tourism, as well as the availability of advanced scientific data and
   technological expertize. Yet their responses have been quite different.
   We examine the biophysical environments of the two cities, as well as
   their socio-economic features, administrative arrangements
   vulnerabilities, and responses to sea level rise and flooding. Our study
   uses a qualitative approach to illustrate how adaptation policies have
   emerged in these two coastal cities. Based on this information, we
   critically compare the different adaptive responses of Venice and Miami
   and suggest what each city may learn from the other, as well as offer
   lessons for other vulnerable coastal cities. In the two cases presented
   here it would seem that adaptation to SLR has not yet led to a
   reformulation of the problem or a structural transformation of the
   relevant institutions. Decision-makers must address the complex issue of
   rising seas with a combination of scientific knowledge, socio-economic
   expertize, and good governance. In this regard, the ``hi-tech{''}
   approach of Venice has generated problems of its own (as did the flood
   control projects in South Florida over half a century ago), while the
   increasing public mobilization in Miami appears more promising. The
   importance of continued long-term adaptation measures is essential in
   both cities.},

   Research documents that significant changes are taking place due to the
   implications of climatic change. Studies concerning climate change
   impact on energy use in buildings in warm climates represent the
   majority of the findings. The volume of research within the consequences
   for the built environment in cold regions is found to be surprisingly
   low, especially concerning the pecuniary stakes involved. However,
   significant regional differences are observed. Though further research
   is of essence, policy/regulatory measures ought already to be taken,
   based on climate scenarios.},

Abstract = {Providing sound evidence to inform decision-making that considers the
   needs of the most vulnerable to climate change will help both adaptation
   and development efforts. Such evidence is particularly important in
   climate change ``hot spots{''}, where strong climate signal and high
   concentrations of vulnerable people are present. These hot spots include
   semiarid regions and deltas of Africa and Asia, and glacier- and
   snowpack-dependent river basins of South Asia. In advance of a major
   research effort focusing on these three hot spots, studies were
   commissioned to identify and characterize the current status of
   knowledge in each on biophysical impacts, social vulnerability, and
   adaptation policy and practice. The resulting seven papers are brought
   together in this special edition, with this editorial introduction
   providing background on these hot spots, the program through which the
   studies were commissioned, and an overview of the papers that follow.},

Title = {Climate risk perceptions and perceived yield loss increases agricultural
   technology adoption in the polder areas of Bangladesh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},

Volume = {94},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change are likely to increase the frequency of
   flood, drought, and salinity events in the coastal areas of Bangladesh,
   posing many challenges for agrarian communities. Sustainable
   intensification in the form of improved agricultural management
   practices and new technologies may help farmers cope with stress and
   adapt to changing conditions. In this study, we explore how climate
   change perceptions of agricultural risk affect adaptation to climate
   change through technology adoption in a unique landscape: the polders of
   Bangladesh. In 2016, a survey was conducted in 1003 households living on
   these artificial, leveed islands facing the Bay of Bengal. We analyzed
   the responses from polder residents to construct a climate risk index
   which quantifies climate risk perception in this highly vulnerable
   agrarian landscape. We analyzed how polder demographics influence their
   perceptions about climatic change using seemingly unrelated regression
   (SUR). Further, by using three bivariate probit regression models, we
   estimated how the perception of climate risk drives the differential
   adoption of new agricultural technologies. Our findings show that
   farmers perceive polder agriculture as highly vulnerable to four
   environmental change factors: flooding, drought, salinity, and pest
   infestation. The SUR model suggests that farmer demographics, community
   group memberships, and access to different inputs and services strongly
   influence climatic risk perceptions. Findings also suggest that polder
   farmers with higher risk perceptions have a higher propensity to adopt
   both chemical and mechanical adaptation strategies. Cost, however,
   limits the ability of farmers to adopt improved technologies, suggesting
   an opportunity for institution-led approaches.},

Title = {Costs of sea dikes - regressions and uncertainty estimates},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {765-779},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Failure to consider the costs of adaptation strategies can be seen by
   decision makers as a barrier to implementing coastal protection
   measures. In order to validate adaptation strategies to sea-level rise
   in the form of coastal protection, a consistent and repeatable
   assessment of the costs is necessary. This paper significantly extends
   current knowledge on cost estimates by developing - and implementing
   using real coastal dike data - probabilistic functions of dike costs.
   Data from Canada and the Netherlands are analysed and related to
   published studies from the US, UK, and Vietnam in order to provide a
   reproducible estimate of typical sea dike costs and their uncertainty.
   We plot the costs divided by dike length as a function of height and
   test four different regression models. Our analysis shows that a linear
   function without intercept is sufficient to model the costs, i.e. fixed
   costs and higher-order contributions such as that due to the volume of
   core fill material are less significant. We also characterise the spread
   around the regression models which represents an uncertainty stemming
   from factors beyond dike length and height. Drawing an analogy with
   project cost overruns, we employ log-normal distributions and calculate
   that the range between 3x and x/3 contains 95\% of the data, where x
   represents the corresponding regression value. We compare our estimates
   with previously published unit costs for other countries. We note that
   the unit costs depend not only on the country and land use
   (urban/non-urban) of the sites where the dikes are being constructed but
   also on characteristics included in the costs, e.g. property
   acquisition, utility relocation, and project management. This paper
   gives decision makers an order of magnitude on the protection costs,
   which can help to remove potential barriers to develop-ing adaptation
   strategies. Although the focus of this research is sea dikes, our
   approach is applicable and transferable to other adaptation measures.},

Title = {Adaptation Optimization of Residential Buildings under Hurricane Threat
   Considering Climate Change in a Lifecycle Context},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to urbanization, the number of residential buildings in coastal
   areas has increased significantly. Additionally, due to the increase in
   sea surface temperature associated with climate change, the intensity
   and frequency of hurricanes has also increased substantially. This paper
   presents a systematic framework for the optimal adaptation of
   residential buildings at a large scale under various scenarios of
   impending climate change during a long-term interval. Different
   adaptation strategies are investigated to ensure adequate structural
   performance and to mitigate the damage loss and adverse consequences to
   society. A genetic algorithm-based optimization process is adopted to
   determine the optimal adaptation types associated with buildings within
   an investigated region. The framework considers the probabilistic
   occurrence models of hurricanes, structural vulnerability of typical
   residential buildings, possible climate change scenarios, and
   optimization of various climate adaptation strategies in a lifecycle
   context. The proposed approach is illustrated on residential buildings
   located in Miami-Dade County, Florida. (C) 2017 American Society of

Abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions have accelerated since the signing of the Kyoto
   Protocol. This discouraging development may partly be blamed on
   accelerating world growth and on lags in policy instruments. However, it
   also raises serious question concerning whether policies to reduce CO2
   emissions are as effective as generally assumed. In recent years, a
   considerable number of studies have identified various feedback
   mechanisms of climate policies that often erode, and occasionally
   reinforce, their effectiveness. These studies generally focus on a few
   feedback mechanisms at a time, without capturing the entire effect.
   Partial accounting of policy feedbacks is common in many climate
   scenarios. The IPCC, for example, only accounts for direct leakage and
   rebound effects. This article attempts to map the aggregate effects of
   different types of climate policy feedback mechanisms in a cohesive
   framework. Controlling feedback effects is essential if the policy
   measures are to make any difference on a global level. A general
   conclusion is that aggregate policy feedback mechanisms tend to make
   current climate policies much less effective than is generally assumed.
   In fact, various policy measures involve a definite risk of `backfiring'
   and actually increasing CO2 emissions. This risk is particularly
   pronounced once effects of climate policies on the pace of innovation in
   climate technology are considered. To stand any chance of controlling
   carbon emissions, it is imperative that feedback mechanisms are
   integrated into emission scenarios, targets for emission reduction and
   implementation of climate policy. In many cases, this will reduce the
   scope for subsidies to renewable energy sources, but increase the scope
   for other measures such as schemes to return carbon dioxide to the
   ground and to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases from wetlands and
   oceans. A framework that incorporates policy feedback effects
   necessitates rethinking the design of the national and regional emission
   targets. This leads us to a new way of formulating emission targets that
   include feedback effects, the global impact target. Once the full
   climate policy feedback mechanisms are accounted for, there are probably
   only three main routes in climate policy that stand a chance of
   mitigating global warming: (a) returning carbon to the ground, (b)
   technological leaps in zero-emission energy technology that make it
   profitable to leave much carbon in the ground even in Annex II countries
   and (c) international agreements that make it more profitable to leave
   carbon in the ground or in forests.},

Abstract = {Energized electron flows through biological systems sustain nature's
   complexity. They drive bacterial, archaeal, and fungal
   oxidation-reduction processes and enable to introduce CO2 and N-2 from
   the atmospheric pool. Electron flux-based food webs convert soil organic
   matter (SOM) in virgin forest and permafrost soils, over-fertilized
   agricultural land, grassland systems, compost/wastewater treatment
   plants, oceans, rain forests, savannahs, and forests of the temperate
   climate zones, and have their strategy adapted on the system in which
   they are active. Thus, the electron driving power is responsible in our
   industrializing world that carbon and nitrogen returns to the atmosphere
   presently with an annual N2O-N proportion of 0.5 to 4.2 terragrams (Tg)
   or an annual atmospheric N2O-N increase of 0.25 \%. N2O is a 300-times
   more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Nature's water-soluble soil carbon
   (C-H2O)/NO3 (-) ratio balancing is seen as a model of how N2O emissions
   could be kept in a tolerable range. Sub strategies beyond are (a) an
   annual 400-800 terragrams (Tg) photosynthate-C (90-95 \% sugars) release
   into plant rhizospheres, (b) spot-wise N enriching animal excrement and
   wide C/N ratio litter fall distributions, (c) viral shunts or life
   shortcuts to supporting O-2 consuming, N supplying, and denitrifying
   recycler communities, (d) subterranean organic-inorganic soil components
   mixing and O-2 diffusion promoting NO3 (-) formation, and (e) the
   release of nitrification inhibiting compounds as neem, karanjin, or
   specific humic acids which help in controlling nitrate formation and
   denitrification. Soil microbial transport vehicles are fungal hyphae,
   plant roots, and subterranean animals. Through their activities,
   aerobic-anaerobic gradients in the soil crumb mosaics emerge. Plant root
   intertissue spaces, animal guts, and co-transported soil crumbs where
   under carbon-dominated C-H2O/NO3 (-) ratios preferred microbes reside
   are mobile locations in well-aerated soils. In such reduction-equivalent
   surplus environments, denitrifying communities are forced to use during
   anaerobic respiration available nitrate-, nitrite ions, NO, and N2O
   economically. Though at carbon-dominated C-H2O/NO3 (-) ratios more N2O
   is reduced to N-2 than in nitrate surplus environments, a complete
   prevention of N2O emissions is not a reality and even not desirable from
   the climate point of view. After describing N2O formation and emissions
   from a compost pile, a municipal wastewater treatment plant, a
   constructed wetland, and mineral N-fertilizer, sewage sludge or
   nitrification inhibitor-stabilized N-fertilizer amended soils with their
   aerobic-anaerobic mosaics, this review tries to deduce exercisable CN
   (C-H2O/NO3) ratio shaping and N2O emission lowering strategies for
   ecologists, agriculturists, and waste managers in our industrializing
   world.},

Abstract = {Climate change is challenging the sustained delivery of ecosystem
   services from urban agriculture. Extreme, prolonged drought in
   combination with high heat events affect urban crop production due to
   limited water availability and affect environmental management and
   adaptation to environmental conditions. In this study, we use urban
   community gardens in central coast California as a system to investigate
   how people are adapting their management behaviors over three time
   periods-before, during and after the longest drought in California's
   recent history. We specifically ask how behavioral change is impacted by
   water policies and gardener characteristics (including gardening
   experience, formal education, drought concern, and relationship to
   nature). Through structural equation modeling and multivariate analyses,
   we show that nature relatedness and gardening experience impact drought
   concern which in turn impact behavioral change, and potentially
   gardener's ability to sustainably manage water and to adapt to drought
   conditions. Planting motivations are also important, influencing
   people's adoption and retention of practices over time. Yet where
   concern may be absent, water policies are able to promote and maintain
   behavioral change and conservation-based practice adoption. Thus,
   environmental awareness and experience in combination with policies are
   needed to promote and support proactive behavioral change and adaptation
   to create resilient urban food production systems under climate change.},

Title = {Potential Sea Level Rise Inundation in the Mediterranean: From
   Susceptibility Assessment to Risk Scenarios for Policy Action},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems and anthropic activities are prone to be affected by
   the negative impact of marine-related processes induced by climate
   change, such as erosion, flooding and permanent inundation. Studies
   aiming at defining potential risk scenarios represent a valuable tool
   for the identification of the most suitable coastal adaptation measures.
   After outlining sea level rise implications at the Mediterranean scale,
   this paper deals with inundation risk scenarios for the years 2050 and
   2100 for the north-eastern sector of the Island of Gozo (Malta), central
   Mediterranean Sea. The analysis, carried out by applying an index-based
   procedure, firstly required the evaluation of the susceptibility to
   inundation of the investigated coastal stretch under different sea level
   projections. Then, the spatial combination of inundation susceptibility
   with the exposure and vulnerability of the area allowed identification
   of the most critical sectors in terms of coastal risk. The results of
   the analysis showed that, under the worst-case climate scenarios, 5.5\%
   and 8.1\% of the investigated coastal sector are prone to very high
   inundation risk (Class R4) in 2050 and 2100, respectively. In
   particular, the bays of Ramla and Marsalforn, which are characterized by
   significant economic and touristic activities, were found to be the
   sites where the expected impacts of future sea level rise will be higher
   if no management strategy and adaptation action are taken in the near
   future.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine adaptive livelihood strategies used
   by small-scale fishing households in the two coastal communities in
   Central Vietnam under the context of climate change-related stressors.
   Design/methodology/approach Field data were collected through mixed
   quantitative and qualitative methods including a review of secondary
   data, key-informant interviews, group discussions and household surveys
   with 300 sampled fishing households. The qualitative data support the
   analysis and discussion of quantitative data. Findings The results
   showed local households' perception of the presence and influence of
   multiple non-climate and climate stressors on their fishery-based
   livelihoods in terms of employment and income in many ways. The affected
   households exerted to develop a diversity of adaptation methods within
   and out of fishing to sustain their livelihoods and cover a deficit in
   household income. The household socio-demographic characteristics
   particularly education, labour force, fishing equipment and social
   support played significant importance in characterising the categories
   of adaptation strategies among the survey households. The role of local
   governments in creating an enabling environment for local-level
   adaptation, as well as protecting marine and coastal ecosystems was
   rather limited despite their recognized importance. Originality/value
   The paper provides an empirical case of how small-scale fishing
   households in coastal communities in Central Vietnam are adapting to
   climate-related stressors. It suggests policy should promote livelihood
   diversification opportunities and address household-level constraints
   for adaptation. Fisheries management plan is urgently needed to control
   illegal fishing activities for sustainable use of coastal and marine
   fishery resources and the appropriate mechanism is important to stretch
   local governments' resources for better supporting local-level
   adaptation.},

Abstract = {In this period of environmental change, understanding how resource users
   respond to such changes is critical for effective resource management
   and adaptation planning. Extensive work has focused on natural resource
   responses to environmental changes, but less has examined the response
   of resource users to such changes. We used an interdisciplinary approach
   to analyse changes in resource use among commercial trawl fishing
   communities in the northwest Atlantic, a region that has shown poleward
   shifts in harvested fish species. We found substantial community-level
   changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger
   vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north,
   while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or
   disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of
   both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither
   changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from
   the data set. This analysis suggests that catch diversity and high
   mobility may buffer fishing communities from effects of environmental
   change. Particularly in times of rapid and uncertain change,
   constructing diverse portfolios and allowing for fleet mobility may
   represent effective adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Co-existence of seals and fisheries? Adaptation of a coastal fishery for
   recovery of the Baltic grey seal},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {450-456},

Abstract = {A complex controversy emerged when the grey seal population in the
   Baltic Sea recovered after decades of stagnation. The seals now cause
   substantial economic losses to coastal fisheries. The paper analyses the
   attempts taken in Finland to mitigate the problems of fishermen. The
   mitigation attempts include the hunting of seals, fishing technology
   development, economic compensations and more comprehensive management
   approaches. These measures are discussed in light of the long-term
   sustainability and adaptability of a coastal fishery. This question is
   important with respect to further discussions on the possibility of the
   coastal fishery's co-existence with seals and sheds light on more
   general goals for the adaptability in the management of
   social-ecological systems. The paper concludes that the more
   comprehensive measures taken have acknowledged the need to enhance the
   fishery's adaptability, but the managerial approach they represent falls
   short of the requirements for successful adaptive management, especially
   in terms of embedding the management into specific coastal contexts. (C)

Title = {Impacts of future urbanization on urban microclimate and thermal comfort
   over the Mumbai metropolitan region, India},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {79},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study examines the microclimatic impacts of future urbanization
   over the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in India using a dynamic
   downscaling approach. Initially, two numerical experiments (curr\_exp
   and fut\_exp) were carried out by integrating 2018 and 2050
   land-use/land-cover patterns under the same meteorological conditions.
   Afterwards, the spatial and temporal changes in surface air temperature,
   wind speed, and thermal discomfort were assessed by comparing the
   simulated results between curr\_exp and fut\_exp. To remediate the
   observed adverse microclimatic impacts of future urbanization, a
   mitigation strategy was designed and implemented in the third experiment
   (miti\_exp). Simulation results show that the average maximum (minimum)
   surface air temperature of the region would increase by 1.41 degrees C
   (1.27 degrees C) due to future urbanization. However, if we adopt the
   mitigation strategy, this growth can be restricted to 0.69 degrees C
   (0.92 degrees C). In the context of thermal discomfort, an additional
   20\% of the total area can undergo hyperthermal treatment by 2050. This
   study reveals that although the implemented mitigation strategy can
   restrict the increasing temperature, it is ineffectual in minimizing the
   thermal discomfort level. The results of this study will be helpful in
   designing area-specific climate action plans through which goals of
   sustainable urban development can be accomplished.},

Abstract = {The Philippine archipelago, which has one of the longest coastlines in
   the world, will not be spared of the adverse impacts of sea-level rise
   and extreme climate events that are expected to happen in a warmer
   world. This study aims to review climate change impacts on Philippine
   coastal communities and to set directions for possible adaptation
   measures on both local and national levels. The erratic changes in the
   climate system have affected various coastal ecosystem and communities.
   Among which coral bleaching, changes in productivity, changes in
   plankton dynamics, alterations in seagrass and sea weed reproduction
   patterns, shoreline erosion and retreat, changes in trophic dynamics as
   well as aggravation of marine diseases are just a few. Apparently, the
   most significant impact is on coastal fisheries yield and community
   welfare. Existing climate change initiatives in the country include
   Integrated Coastal Zone Management System (ICZM), coastal policies and
   regulations (e.g. Fisheries Code), disaster management strategies among
   others. However, there is lack of integration for these initiatives in
   the context of climate change. Several points were raised as suggestions
   and solutions. An improved network of strategies should be created and a
   multisectoral approach should be adapted. Macro and micro-tevel
   adaptation measures should be defined and evaluated to ensure effective
   dissemination and implementation. The national government embodies the
   authority for governance and policies. On the other hand, local
   government should focus on implementation in collaboration with the
   academe (technical support), non-government organizations (advocacy,
   information, education and communication), private, and financial
   institutions (financial assistance). Recent observations on climate
   change impacts are sufficient evidence to raise this issue as a national
   concern. Recognizing and accepting that climate is indeed altering the
   planet is crucial and a change of mindset should begin within us.},

Abstract = {Monitoring provides important feedback on how social and environmental
   systems are tracking and whether or not human activities, including
   management activities, are having an impact. This paper describes an
   approach applied to develop an integrated monitoring framework to inform
   adaptive management of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, a
   complex, multi-jurisdictional, multi-sectoral marine system of
   international importance. It identifies the gaps and opportunities to
   integrate the existing long-term, short-term and compliance-related
   monitoring and reporting initiatives to provide the information for more
   effective and efficient (adaptive) management of the Great Barrier Reef
   World Heritage Area. And as importantly it aligns expectations among
   different agencies about how monitoring will inform management. Fifty
   two high priority values, processes and pressures for management were
   identified along with 65 existing monitoring programs. Developing the
   monitoring framework was useful in several ways. First it brought
   together scientists, policy- makers, managers, and other interested
   stakeholders with different agendas, philosophies and incentives and
   established a common purpose, lexicon and language for an integrated
   monitoring program. Second, it highlighted the importance and usefulness
   of qualitative conceptual models as a framework for focused discussion
   around a set of hypotheses with relevance for management. Third, the
   process started an important conversation about defining and setting a
   realistic number of monitoring priorities for management. Finally, it
   has provided direction for how to build on existing initiatives to
   develop an integrated monitoring program for a globally significant
   world heritage area.},

Title = {Puerto Rican Farmers' Obstacles Toward Recovery and Adaptation
   Strategies After Hurricane Maria: A Mixed-Methods Approach to
   Understanding Adaptive Capacity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Farmers across the globe are experiencing compounding shocks that make
   evident the need to better understand potential drivers and barriers to
   strengthen adaptive capacity. This is especially true in the context of
   a disaster, where a disruption in the natural and built environment
   hinders livelihood strategies and exposes the underlying dynamics that
   perpetuate vulnerability to natural hazards. As such, the
   interconnections of structural and individual attributes must be
   considered when evaluating adaptive capacity. This paper uses a
   convergent mixed-methods approach to assess Puerto Rican farmers' actual
   and intended adoption of adaptation practices, in light of the obstacles
   they faced toward recovery after 2017's category four Hurricane Maria,
   to contribute to better understanding adaptive capacity. This study uses
   data from 405 farmers across Puerto Rico (87\% response rate), surveyed
   8 months after Maria by agricultural agents of the Extension Service of
   the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. Quantitative data was
   assessed through negative binomial regressions (actual adoption) and
   generalized linear models (intended adoption), while qualitative data
   (reported obstacles) were analyzed through thematic analysis. This study
   found that almost half of farmers adopted an adaptation practice after
   Maria, and that in many cases, broader structures, such as systems of
   governance, farmers' social networks, and infrastructure, affect
   adaptive capacity more than individual perceptions of capacity. Future
   adaptation strategies and interventions, especially in the context of
   disaster, should consider the extent to which structural factors hinder
   individuals' ability to prepare for, respond, and recover from the
   impacts of these shocks. Our results show that there might be
   opportunity to enact new systems in light of catastrophic events, but
   this does not solely depend on individual actions. The mixed-methods
   approach used can inform future studies in better assessing adaptive
   capacity from a standpoint that incorporates individual and structural
   components.},

Title = {Mapping Coastal Flood Susceptible Areas Using Shannon's Entropy Model:
   The Case of Muscat Governorate, Oman},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Floods are among the most common natural hazards around the world.
   Mapping and evaluating potential flood hazards are essential for flood
   risk management and mitigation strategies, particularly in coastal
   areas. Several factors play significant roles in flooding and
   recognizing the role of these flood-related factors may enhance flood
   disaster prediction and mitigation strategies. This study focuses on
   using Shannon's entropy model to predict the role of seven factors in
   causing floods in the Governorate of Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, and
   mapping coastal flood-prone areas. The seven selected factors (including
   ground elevation, slope degree, hydrologic soil group (HSG), land use,
   distance from the coast, distance from the wadi, and distance from the
   road) were initially prepared and categorized into classes based on
   their contribution to flood occurrence. In the next step, the entropy
   model was used to determine the weight and contribution of each factor
   in overall susceptibility. Finally, results from the previous two steps
   were combined using ArcGIS software to produce the final coastal flood
   susceptibility index map that was categorized into five susceptibility
   zones. The result indicated that land use and HSG are the most causative
   factors of flooding in the area, and about 133.5 km(2) of the extracted
   area is threatened by coastal floods. The outcomes of this study can
   provide decision-makers with essential information for identifying flood
   risks and enhancing adaptation and mitigation strategies. For future
   work, it is recommended to evaluate the reliability of the obtained
   result by comparing it with a real flooding event, such as flooding
   during cyclones Gonu and Phet.},

Abstract = {Climate change issues and adaptation strategies have drawn much
   attention from many fields in recent years. Taiwan, an island state, is
   deeply threatened by the multiple threats posed by climate change.
   However, different urban and rural areas have numerous adaptation
   approaches due to their differences in vulnerability. In Taipei City
   (urban), its biophysical vulnerability is mainly affected by flooded
   areas and high flood depths caused by landslides and heavy rains. Its
   social vulnerability is affected by economic development, high household
   assets, and population concentration. In Yunlin County (rural), its
   biophysical vulnerability is also affected by flooded areas and high
   flood depths caused by heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected
   by the elderly living alone, low household assets, and low healthcare.
   In order to propose appropriate adaptation strategies of urban and rural
   areas under different vulnerabilities, this study uses an overlapping
   method to examine the relationship between the integrated vulnerability
   (biophysical and social) of Taipei and Yunlin along with the ecological
   footprint (EF), a measurement of human demands for resources and
   ecological services. This study reviews the literature and uses Taiwan's
   NCDR (National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction)
   data to analyze the biophysical vulnerability and the social
   vulnerability and further calculate the integrated vulnerability. In
   this study, questionnaire surveys were conducted. In Taipei, 446 valid
   questionnaires were collected, while 393 were collected in Yunlin. The
   results show that personal EF in Taipei is higher than that in Yunlin.
   In the end, this study elucidates the relationship between integrated
   vulnerability and personal EF of Taipei and Yunlin. Four types of risk
   areas in urban Taipei and rural Yunlin are sorted out (high
   vulnerability/high EF, high vulnerability/low EF, low vulnerability/high
   EF, and low vulnerability/low EF). The empirical results can be adopted
   by local governments, communities, and NGOs to establish appropriate
   strategies for mitigation and adaptation in the different risk areas.},

Title = {Stepping Up versus Stepping Out: On the outcomes and drivers of two
   alternative climate change adaptation strategies of smallholders},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {148},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Which of the two climate change adaptation strategies - adjusting or
   improving farming (defined as Stepping Up) versus reducing or exiting
   farming (defined as Stepping Out) - provides better developmen-tal
   outcomes for smallholder farmers? Are the drivers of these two
   strategies different? Do the outcomes and drivers vary according to
   farmland holding size? We investigated these unanswered questions,
   inspired primarily by a widespread but unverified suggestion that
   stepping out of farming can be a better option for smallholders. We
   utilised recent survey data from over eight hundred smallholder
   households located in climatic hazard-prone areas in Bangladesh. We
   applied a holistic Driver-Strategy-Outcome analytical framework and
   rigorous statistical methods, including index-based data aggregation,
   and Structural Equation Modelling with `mediation' and `moderation'
   analyses. Contrary to widespread spec-ulations, we found that Stepping
   Out had a large negative effect on smallholders' livelihood Outcomes;
   while Stepping Up had a moderate, but positive effect. The
   natural-environmental Drivers of Stepping Up and Stepping Out were
   similar; however, the psychological-institutional Drivers of each
   differed, with the same factor acting as a driver for one strategy
   whilst as a deterrent for the other. We found significant `mediatory'
   effects of both the adaptation Strategies on Outcomes as well as
   significant `moderation' effects of farmland holding size on the Drivers
   and Outcomes, with the positive effect of Stepping Up observed for
   smallholders owing lands of <2.5 acres only. We call for relevant
   policies and interventions to exercise caution in promoting
   smallholders' exit from agriculture, and to adopt appropriate mitigating
   measures to manage such a transition. Moreover, smallholder agricultural
   development initiatives should not discount even the `smallest of
   smallholders' and support them through `diverse and complementary
   innovations' as well as `tailored' institutional support services,
   especially for those living in proximity to hazard hotspots. (c) 2021

Title = {Funding climate adaptation strategies with climate derivatives},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {9-15},
Abstract = {Climate adaptation requires large capital investments that could be
   provided not only by traditional sources like governments and banks, but
   also by derivatives markets. Such markets would allow two parties with
   different tolerances and expectations about climate risks to transact
   for their mutual benefit and, in so doing, finance climate adaptation.
   Here we calculate the price of a derivative called a European put
   option, based on future sea surface temperature (SST) in Tasmania,
   Australia, with an 18 degrees C strike threshold. This price represents
   a quantifiable indicator of climate risk, and forms the basis for
   aquaculture industries exposed to the risk of higher SST to finance
   adaptation strategies through the sale of derivative contracts. Such
   contracts provide a real incentive to parties with different climate
   outlooks, or risk exposure to take a market assessment of climate
   change. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Nature-based solutions for coastal adaptation management, concepts and
   scope, an overview},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Abstract = {The paper introduces nature-based solutions (NBS) and their application
   in coastal adaptation management. NBS seek to make use of local natural
   elements and processes in coastal ecosystems, as much as possible, to
   harness forces of nature for the benefit of society. We focus on soft
   sedimentary coasts, like beaches and dunes, salt marshes, seagrass beds
   and mangroves. By shifting coastal management from conventional
   `Building in Nature' to `Building with Nature', NBS can be seen as a
   valuable alternative to the traditional approach, which is based on
   hydraulic, civil engineered designs. NBS can be applied in diverse
   situations and at various scales, from small-scale (ecosystem elements,
   a small pond) to large-scale (entire coastal stretches). The practice of
   NBS is also valuable for climate change adaptation, when forces of
   nature will increase. NBS requires a governance setting that makes use
   of an integrated approach with disciplines of ecology, economy and
   society working together. But integration is not yet common practise in
   many countries. We conclude that NBS are a promising alternative to the
   traditional approach. Because the practise still is relatively young,
   more field and laboratory projects should be executed, in particular
   under extreme weather conditions. The future challenge is to build up
   more stakeholder acceptance and (local) trust in the concept.},

Title = {Participatory and rapid vulnerability assessments to support adaptation
   planning in small-scale fishing communities of the Benguela Current
   Large Marine Ecosystem},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal fishing communities who depend on marine resources for food and
   livelihood are particularly vulnerable to the risks and impacts
   associated with climate variability and change. Countries in the BCLME
   region have responded to international calls to develop national climate
   change policies, adaptation strategies and plans to respond to these
   threats. These high-level documents recognize the need to better
   understand the vulnerabilities facing poor and marginalized communities
   in high risk areas and develop adaptive capacity to build resilience.
   However, small-scale fisheries are seldom explicitly mentioned.
   Furthermore, there is very little guidance on how vulnerability
   assessments should be conducted and how this information could inform
   adaptation planning. This paper reports on a community based,
   participatory and rapid vulnerability assessment methodology that was
   developed, tested and then applied in 15 communities in the BCLME
   region. The outcomes of these vulnerability assessments were then used
   to inform the development of local adaptation plans in five of these
   communities. Key findings from these local vulnerability assessments and
   adaptation planning processes are then presented. The discussion centers
   on the value, benefits and limitations of the participatory and rapid
   vulnerability assessment process, the need to take a holistic approach
   to understanding vulnerability, the ongoing and iterative nature of
   adaptation planning, the power of partnerships and networks, and the
   need to integrate community-based plans into other sector and climate
   change adaptation strategies and plans at all levels of governance.},

Abstract = {The overall agricultural system in the Nile Delta region is considered
   as one of the highest intensive and complicated agriculture systems in
   the world. According to the recent studies, the Nile Delta region is one

   level rise, soil and water degradation, undiversified crop-pattern,
   yield reduction, pests and disease severity, and irrigation and drainage
   management were the main key factors that increased vulnerability of the
   agriculture sector in that region. The main objective of this study is
   to conduct a community-based multi-criteria adaptation assessment in the
   Nile Delta using a preset questionnaire. A list of possible adaptation
   measures for agriculture sector was evaluated. The results indicated
   that the Nile Delta growers have strong perceptions to act positively to
   reduce the impacts of climate change. They reflected the need to improve
   the their adaptive capacity based on clear scientific message with

Abstract = {This article examines whether some response strategies to climate
   variability and change have the potential to undermine long-term
   resilience of social-ecological systems. We define the parameters of a
   resilience approach, suggesting that resilience is characterized by the
   ability to absorb perturbations without changing overall system
   function, the ability to adapt within the resources of the system
   itself, and the ability to learn, innovate, and change. We evaluate nine
   current regional climate change policy responses and examine governance,
   sensitivity to feedbacks, and problem framing to evaluate impacts on
   characteristics of a resilient system. We find that some responses, such
   as the increase in harvest rates to deal with pine beetle infestations
   in Canada and expansion of biofuels globally, have the potential to
   undermine long-term resilience of resource systems. Other responses,
   such as decentralized water planning in Brazil and tropical storm
   disaster management in Caribbean islands, have the potential to increase
   long-term resilience. We argue that there are multiple sources of
   resilience in most systems and hence policy should identify such sources
   and strengthen capacities to adapt and learn. (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Title = {Lessons in applying adaptive management on a dynamic coastline: a case

Abstract = {Many of the world's coastlines are vulnerable to erosion and at risk
   from tidal flooding. Addressing and managing these risks presents major
   challenges especially when seeking to sustainably balance the
   requirements for coastal protection with other economic, environmental,
   and societal objectives. The nature and scale of these challenges varies
   greatly from site to site and can often be magnified on dynamic
   shorelines that are subject to a high degree of physical and ecological
   change. Applying an ongoing process of adaptive management is widely
   agreed to be a key mechanism for dealing with such dynamic conditions
   and issues of uncertainty. However, under this process it can be
   difficult for different stakeholders to reach a consensus about the most
   suitable intervention actions. In part, this can arise because there is
   an incomplete understanding about past, present, and, especially, future
   environmental processes. It can also occur due to differences in the
   perceptions and priorities of the relevant stakeholders. This paper
   reviews some of these complexities using, as a case study, recent
   developments of a shingle spit and tidal inlet at Pagham Harbour, on the
   south coast of the UK. This example provides lessons in the application
   of adaptive management and working with nature concepts in a
   particularly complex coastal setting. This paper considers these lessons
   in the context of the site's history, the legal and policy framework,
   and established understanding about the natural environment.},

Abstract = {A scenario of increased risks due to climate change and coastal erosion,
   coupled with a stringent economic recession, is threatening the
   Portuguese coast. Three particular locations are the focus of CHANGE
   Changing Coasts, Changing Climate, Changing Communities, a 3-year study
   (2010-2013) that aims to understand social perceptions about coastal
   risks and to examine new ways of adaptive management. The project
   involved assessing peoples' representations about the coastal present
   and possible coastal futures and discussed coastal change with local
   populations, in a country in which the protection of vulnerable coast to
   date has had little public involvement. The three coastal stretches
   studied face increasing coastal risks and the perspective of reduced
   public spending, fuelling uncertainty about their future. Public
   participation in coastal management has been almost entirely absent,
   which makes the social science based contribution of this research even
   more relevant. This research combines: a) scientific assessments on the
   past and future evolution of the shoreline, taking into account the
   impacts of climate change; b) interviews with policy-makers, coastal
   experts and stakeholders, as well as local public opinion surveys; c)
   the outputs of a model for coastal governance and community building,
   based on local discussions through focus groups and workshops. This
   paper is based on the surveys and focus groups undertaken in the
   case-study area most at risk from coastal change, Vagueira. We conclude
   that there is a growing perception of coastal threat and potential for
   the development of adaptive coastal management, taking advantage of
   local knowledge and initiative.},

   an additional 250,000 deaths between 2030 and 2050, with damages to
   health costing US\$2-\$4 billion by 2030. Although much debate still
   surrounds climate change, island ecosystems-such as Cuba's-in the
   developing world are arguably among the most vulnerable contexts in
   which to confront climate variability. Beginning in the 1990s, Cuba
   launched research to develop the evidence base, set policy priorities,
   and design mitigation and adaptation actions specifically to address
   climate change and its effects on health.
   Two researchers at the forefront of this interdisciplinary,
   intersectoral effort are epidemiologist Dr Guillermo Mesa, who directed
   design and implementation of the nationwide strategy for disaster risk
   reduction in the Cuban public health system as founding director of the
   Latin American Center for Disaster Medicine (CLAMED) and now heads the
   Disasters and Health department at the National School of Public Health;
   and Dr Paulo Ortiz, a biostatistician and economist at the Cuban
   Meteorology Institute's Climate Center (CEN-CLIM), who leads the

Title = {Effectiveness of coral relocation as a mitigation strategy in Kane'ohe
   Bay, Hawai'i},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Coral reef restoration and management techniques are in ever-increasing
   demand due to the global decline of coral reefs in the last several
   decades. Coral relocation has been established as an appropriate
   restoration technique in select cases, particularly where corals are
   scheduled for destruction. However, continued long-term monitoring of
   recovery of transplanted corals is seldom sustained. Removal of coral
   from a navigation channel and relocation to a similar nearby dredged
   site occurred in 2005. Coral recovery at the donor site and changes in
   fish populations at the receiving site were tracked periodically over
   the following decade. Coral regrowth at the donor site was rapid until a
   recent bleaching event reduced coral cover by more than half. The
   transplant of mature colonies increased spatial complexity at the
   receiving site, immediately increasing fish biomass, abundance, and
   species that was maintained throughout subsequent surveys. Our research
   indicates that unlike the majority of historical accounts of coral
   relocation in the Pacific, corals transplanted into wave-protected areas
   with similar conditions as the original site can have high survival
   rates. Data on long-term monitoring of coral transplants in diverse
   environments is central in developing management and mitigation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {There is a desire in the scientific community and various U.S. federal

   is not yet available. Some U.S. coastal states (e.g., California Coastal
   Conservancy, 2009 and Cyan et al, 2006) have drafted approaches to
   include the effects of climate change. In the absence of specific
   guidance, however, coastal management agencies are often at the center
   of the debate surrounding the need to plan for sea level rise (SLR) and
   are forced to act in an ad hoc manner. In some cases, permits for new
   developments and existing projects cannot proceed without an agreement
   to address SLR. This paper presents an adaptive management approach that
   starts with an initial structure which is then strengthened over time to
   meet SLR.},

Abstract = {Coastal water supply infrastructure systems are exposed to saltwater
   intrusion exacerbated by sea-level rise stressors. To enable assessing
   the long-term resilience of these systems to the impact of sea-level

   processes of utility agencies, and dynamic processes of water supply
   infrastructure performance. Using the proposed framework and data
   collected from South Miami-Dade service area, a multi-agent simulation
   model was created to conduct exploratory assessments of the long-term
   resilience of water supply infrastructure under various sea-level rise
   scenarios and adaptation approaches. The results showed the capability
   of the proposed model for scenario landscape generation to discover
   robust adaptation pathways for enhanced infrastructure resilience under
   uncertainty. The analysis results could provide actionable scientific
   information to water infrastructure managers to improve their adaptation
   planning and investment decision-making processes.},

Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {137-156},
Abstract = {This paper situates livelihood adaptations in two coastal villages
   within the broader context of Belize's colonial and post-colonial
   history and environmental processes of change. Through observations,
   qualitative interviews, and archival reviews, we explore the dynamics of
   livelihood change and analyse the diverse factors that have been
   influencing options and adaptation over time. The results reveal that
   both villages have undergone profound changes in livelihoods and
   productive activities on several occasions. While the villages'
   histories, geographies, and cultures are different, similarities in
   long-term trends include the transition from land-based to marine
   resources and the decline of small-scale agriculture. Our analysis
   illuminates the deep connections between local livelihoods and national
   as well as global political-economic processes, which favour extraction
   and export of natural resources throughout the period investigated,
   whereby resource access and market mechanisms create and constrict
   adaptation options for the villagers. Gradual environmental changes,
   such as erosion, and episodic events, such as hurricanes, have also
   influenced livelihood shifts and adaptations in combination with a wide
   range of political-economic factors. Despite the demonstrated importance
   of the influence of history and dimensions of political economy on
   contemporary adaptation options in the communities studied, the
   literature on climate change adaptation inadequately accounts for these
   factors. This paper adds new perspectives to current debates in climate
   change research by emphasising that longer temporal dimensions of
   livelihood change are important for understanding the current context
   for adaptation.},

   and the local situation is discussed in the context of the extent to
   which resilience theory and national policy intertwine. These approaches
   identify and combine nature-based solutions and compatible
   engineering-based solutions, demonstrating how resilience can be

Abstract = {Managing and mitigating the global expansion of toxic cyanobacterial
   harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) is a major challenge facing researchers
   and water resource managers. Various approaches, including nutrient load
   reduction, artificial mixing and flushing, omnivorous fish removal,
   algaecide applications and sediment dredging, have been used to reduce
   bloom occurrences. However, managers now face the additional challenge
   of having to address the effects of climate change on watershed
   hydrological and nutrient load dynamics, water temperature, mixing
   regime and internal nutrient cycling. Rising temperatures and increasing
   frequencies and magnitudes of extreme weather events, including tropical
   cyclones, extratropical storms, floods and droughts, all promote
   CyanoHABs and affect the efficacy of ecosystem remediation measures.
   These climatic changes will likely require setting stricter nutrient
   (including both nitrogen and phosphorus) reduction targets for bloom
   control in affected waters. In addition, the efficacy of currently used
   methods to reduce CyanoHABs will need to be re-evaluated in light of the
   synergistic effects of climate change with nutrient enrichment.},

Title = {Strengthening of the hydrological cycle in future scenarios: atmospheric
   energy and water balance perspective},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-212},
Abstract = {Future climate scenarios experiencing global warming are expected to
   strengthen the hydrological cycle during the 21st century (21C). We
   analyze the strengthening of the global-scale increase in precipitation
   from the perspective of changes in whole atmospheric water and energy
   balances. By combining energy and water equations for the whole
   atmosphere, we obtain constraints for the changes in surface fluxes and
   partitioning at the surface between sensible and latent components. We
   investigate the differences in the strengthening of the hydrological
   cycle in two centennial simulations performed with an Earth system model
   forced with specified atmospheric concentration pathways. Alongside the
   Special Report on Emissions Scenario (SRES) A1B, which is a medium-high
   non-mitigation scenario, we consider a new aggressive-mitigation
   scenario (E1) with reduced fossil fuel use for energy production aimed
   at stabilizing global warming below 2 K.
   Our results show that the mitigation scenario effectively constrains the
   global warming with a stabilization below 2K with respect to the
   1950-2000 historical period. On the other hand, the E1 precipitation
   does not follow the temperature field toward a stabilization path but
   continues to increase over the mitigation period. Quite unexpectedly,
   the mitigation scenario is shown to strengthen the hydrological cycle
   even more than SRES A1B till around 2070. We show that this is mostly a
   consequence of the larger increase in the negative radiative imbalance
   of atmosphere in E1 compared to A1B. This appears to be primarily
   related to decreased sulfate aerosol concentration in E1, which
   considerably reduces atmospheric absorption of solar radiation compared
   to A1B.
   The last decades of the 21C show a marked increase in global
   precipitation in A1B compared to E1, despite the fact that the two
   scenarios display almost the same overall increase of radiative
   imbalance with respect to the 20th century. Our results show that
   radiative cooling is weakly effective in A1B throughout the 21C. Two
   distinct mechanisms characterize the diverse strengthening of the
   hydrological cycle in the middle and end-21C. It is only through a very
   large perturbation of surface fluxes that A1B achieves a larger increase
   in global precipitation in the last decades of the 21C. Our energy/water
   budget analysis shows that this behavior is ultimately due to a
   bifurcation in the Bowen ratio change between the two scenarios.
   This work warns that mitigation policies that promote aerosol abatement,
   may lead to an unexpected stronger intensification of the hydrological
   cycle and associated changes that may last for decades after global
   warming is effectively mitigated. On the other hand, it is also
   suggested that predictable components of the radiative forcing by
   aerosols may have the potential to effectively contribute to the
   decadal-scale predictability of changes in the hydrological strength.},

Title = {The state of the art in monitoring and verification-Ten years on},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {312-349},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the ten years since publication of the IPCC Special Report on CCS,
   there has been considerable progress in monitoring and verification
   (M\&V). Numerous injection projects, ranging from small injection pilots
   to much larger longer-term commercial operations, have been successfully
   monitored to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies, and technologies
   have been adapted and implemented to demonstrate containment,
   conformance, and no environmental impact. In this review we consider
   M\&V chiefly from the perspective of its ability to satisfy stakeholders
   that these three key requirements are being met. From selected project
   examples, we show how this was done, and reflect particularly on the
   nature of the verification process. It is clear that deep-focussed
   monitoring will deliver the primary requirement to demonstrate
   conformance and containment and to provide early warning of any
   deviations from predicted storage behaviour. Progress in seismic
   imaging, especially offshore, and the remarkable results with InSAR from
   In Salah are highlights of the past decade. A wide range of shallow
   monitoring techniques has been tested at many sites, focussing
   especially on the monitoring of soil gas and groundwater. Quantification
   of any detected emissions would be required in some jurisdictions to
   satisfy carbon mitigation targets in the event of leakage to surface:
   however, given the likely high security of foreseeable storage sites, we
   suggest that shallow monitoring should focus mainly on assuring against
   environmental impacts. This reflects the low risk profile of well
   selected and well operated storage sites and recognizes the over-arching
   need for monitoring to be directed to specific, measureable risks. In
   particular, regulatory compliance might usefully involve clearer
   articulation of leakage scenarios, with this specificity making it
   possible to demonstrate ``no leakage{''} in a more objective way than is
   currently the case. We also consider the monitoring issues for CO2-EOR,
   and argue that there are few technical problems in providing assurance
   that EOR sites are successfully sequestering CO2; the issues lie largely
   in linking existing oil and gas regulations to new greenhouse gas
   policy. We foresee that, overall, monitoring technologies will continue
   to benefit from synergies with oil and gas operations, but that the
   distinctive regulatory and certification environments for CCS may pose
   new questions. Overall, while there is clearly scope for technical
   improvements, more clearly posed requirements, and better communication
   of monitoring results, we reiterate that this has been a decade of
   significant achievement that leaves monitoring and verification well
   placed to serve the wider CCS enterprise. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Title = {Direct and Indirect Cost-and-Benefit Assessment of Climate Adaptation
   Strategies for Housing for Extreme Wind Events in Queensland},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The intensity of tropical cyclones and severe storms is likely to
   increase due to climate change. Brisbane and the northeast coast of
   Queensland are regions where design wind specifications may be
   inadequate under either current or likely future climate conditions. An
   appropriate adaptation strategy may be one that increases wind
   classifications for new houses, which leads to a reduced vulnerability
   of new construction. The present paper will assess the damage risks,
   adaptation costs, and cost-effectiveness of these adaptation measures
   for residential construction in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, and
   South East Queensland, assuming time-dependent changes in the frequency
   and intensity of cyclonic and noncyclonic winds to 2100. Loss functions
   are also developed for direct and indirect losses. It was found that
   increasing design wind loads for new houses in Brisbane and South East
   Queensland will lead to a net benefit {[}net present value (NPV)] of up
   to \$10.5 billion by 2100, assuming a discount rate of 4\%, which
   includes approximately 95\% of a direct benefit and 5\% of an indirect
   benefit. The benefits are highest for Brisbane due to its large
   population and the high vulnerability of existing residential
   construction, and have a 90-100\% likelihood of achieving a net benefit
   by 2100. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {On the feasibility of managed retreat in the Wadden Sea of
   Schleswig-Holstein},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1069-1079},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sea embankments along the mainland coastline in the Schleswig-Holstein
   Wadden Sea safeguard 130,000 people and 19 billion euro of capital
   assets from flooding during storm surges. Due to climate change induced
   sea-level rise, these defences will become exposed to higher storm
   surges and adaptation becomes inevitable. As an alternative to
   strengthening, managed retreat is discussed in literature as a coastal
   risk management option for climate change adaptation. Based on an
   evaluation of examples from the Wadden Sea, this paper elaborates
   managed retreat as alternative climate change adaptation from a coastal
   risk management perspective. This paper concludes that, conform the
   principles of integrated coastal zone management, one precondition for
   successful implementation of managed retreat is local acceptance. With
   respect to natural resilience to sea-level rise, managed retreat may
   counteract the loss of Wadden Sea structures and habitats due to coastal
   squeeze. However, the effectiveness depends on the surface elevation in
   the opened polder. If large volumes of sediment are needed to restore a
   natural elevation, regional resilience against SLR-induced drowning may
   deteriorate. With respect to coastal flood risk management in
   Schleswig-Holstein, opened polders have no significance as flood
   retention rooms and managed retreat does not reduce the hazard of
   flooding in surrounding polders. Further, removal of primary embankments
   requires large efforts to secure flood safety in adjacent polders. Under
   certain conditions, removal or opening of embankments may constitute
   sustainable coastal risk management, e.g., if retreat leads to a shorter
   line of defence or if other win-win-situations like securing of NATURA
   2000 coherence arise.},

Title = {Enhancing early warning in the light of migration and environmental

Abstract = {Early Warning Systems (EWS) are key elements of risk reduction and
   adaptation strategies to extreme events. Until now, most EWS have
   focused mainly on hazard detection and the immediate warning and
   evacuation processes with an effort of saving lives in the context of an
   extreme event; however, in the light of climate change and migration
   more attention must also be paid to the question of how EWS can improve
   livelihood security. On the one hand, migration patterns, urbanization
   and population growth are important factors that will modify and in most
   cases increase exposure, and in some cases increase vulnerability. On
   the other hand, migration in the context of extreme events and sea level
   rise might also be an important adaptation strategy. The paper deals
   with the concept of people-centred early warning and examines how
   aspects of the so-called Last Mile can be better taken into account. In
   this regard, the framework conditions and the governance context of
   early warning are discussed and analysed. Strategies on how to enhance
   EWS are outlined, particularly regarding the nexus between migration,
   urbanization, daily mobility and early warning. Up to now, most EWS do
   not sufficiently consider migration and daily mobility patterns within
   the information or warning chain. Therefore, the paper examines the
   importance of migration, urbanization and daily mobility patterns for
   effective early warning. On the basis of this discussion, the paper
   identifies new challenges for early warning in the context of climate
   change and deals with the potential constraints of integrative EWS.
   Finally, the paper derives conclusions and recommendations on not only
   how to better account for migration in EWS, but also how to improve the
   consideration of early warning in migration and adaptation strategies.

Title = {Urban mitigation and building adaptation to minimize the future cooling

Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},

Volume = {204},
Pages = {708-719},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In several areas of the world, the population concentrates along the
   coastal regions, benefitting from the sea breeze, with warmer inland
   areas. However, increasing population is driving urban sprawl in
   traditionally low-density areas, enhancing the synergies between global
   and local climate change. Here we show that local climate mitigation can
   reduce the impacts of climate change, with the analysis of a new
   development area in Sydney, 50 km from the coast. With meso-scale
   climate modelling, we computed that by 2050 the peak summer temperature
   will increase by 0.8 degrees C and the daily average summer temperature
   by 1.6 degrees C. Mitigation with cool materials, greenery, and
   irrigation will lower the peak and average daily temperatures
   respectively by 2.2 degrees C and 1.6 degrees C with respect to the
   unmitigated future climate scenario. Mitigation techniques when applied
   in the whole Sydney area yield to cooling energy needs reductions by
   6.7-8.6 kWh/m(2) (13.4-19.3\%) for typical residential, office, and
   school buildings, with a negligible heating penalty, compared to an
   unmitigated future scenario. Combined adaptation and mitigation can
   reduce the future cooling energy needs by 31.3 kWh/m(2) (70\%), 29.3
   kWh/m(2) (57.3\%), and 20.9 kWh/m(2) (59.4\%) for typical residential,
   office, and school building, respectively. Our study indicates that the
   consolidated and widely available mitigation technologies alone cannot
   counteract the energy impact of both global and local climate change. A
   structured system of interventions at building and urban scale is
   necessary while developing novel and higher efficiency mitigation
   technologies.},

Title = {What individual and neighbourhood-level factors increase the risk of
   heat-related mortality? A case-crossover study of over 185,000 deaths in
   London using high-resolution climate datasets},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: Management of the natural and built environments can help
   reduce the health impacts of climate change. This is particularly
   relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer
   than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing
   characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association
   between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area.
   Methods: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area
   during May-Sept 2007-2016 to a high resolution daily temperature
   dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a
   case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure
   by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural
   environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built
   environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and
   socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of
   employment and prevalence of ill-health).
   Results: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of
   urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation,
   social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related
   mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95\%
   CI=1.039, 1.036-1.043 per 1 degrees C temperature increase). Vegetation
   cover showed the greatest modification effect, for example the odds of
   heat-related mortality in quartiles with the highest and lowest tree
   cover were OR, 95\%CI 1.033, 1.026-1.039 and 1.043, 1.037-1.050
   respectively. None of the socio-economic variables were a significant
   modifier of heat-related mortality.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that urban vegetation can modify the
   mortality risk associated with heat exposure. These findings make an
   important contribution towards informing city-level climate change
   adaptation and mitigation policies.},

Title = {Adaptation to climate change in coastal towns of between 10,000 and

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {This chapter focuses on mainland coastal towns that have populations of
   between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants. Through six case studies, the
   chapter develops an understanding of the characteristics that shape each
   of the communities. By exploring the climate change hazards each of the
   case studies are experiencing now and forecast into the future, the
   physical and ecological profile and the human development condition, a
   view of the climate impacts for each is shaped. The six case study areas
   include towns that are large enough to be a regional centre, down to
   much less organised and resourced communities that are at a more
   subsistence level of development. The case studies include communities
   that range from tropical storm areas to more temperate climatic areas.
   Adaptation strategies for each case study are observed, drawing out the
   similarities and the differences. Insights and lessons learnt show that
   the bottom-up inclusion of all communities in shaping the adaptation
   approach is crucial, together with alignment of policy between
   governments from national to local. Also crucial is the resourcing of
   local councils which sit on the front line of many adaptation
   initiatives. The role of universities and other research organisations
   to provide data, skills training and a toolbox of methodologies to those
   in the front line leadership roles. An important insight is the
   collaborative opportunity for universities, communities and agencies to
   draw out the innovative adaptation strategies that can inform other
   coastal communities from the smallest village to the largest city.},

Title = {Adaptive Behaviors to Marine Ecosystem Shifts: Examining Fishermen's
   Strategies in Response to Abundant Juvenile Sablefish (Anoplopoma
   fimbria) in Alaska},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Over recent years there have been rapid changes occurring across marine
   ecosystems worldwide, with high latitude systems seeing ecosystem shifts
   emerging at unprecedented rates. The Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea
   marine ecosystems have experienced substantial fluctuation in fish
   stocks, with some species experiencing considerable decreases while
   others thrive. Following the marine heatwave of 2014, sablefish
   (Anoplopoma fimbria) had a historically unparalleled juvenile
   recruitment class that is now dominating the stock composition. While
   this recruitment class bodes well for future fisheries, it is currently
   undermining the value of the fishery with limited incentives to retain
   the smaller and less valuable fish, compounding adverse effects on
   earnings in the fishery due to whale depredation that has been occurring
   for years. This study examines the well-being implications of
   fishermen's adaptive strategies to these ecosystem conditions within the
   Alaska sablefish fishery using a socioecological system framework,
   operationalized as a qualitative network model (QNMs) and quantitative
   indicators. We examine the extent to which adaptation strategies,
   derived from a literature review and stakeholder interviews, are being
   utilized in the fishery with quantitative indicators. These strategies
   are then examined with QNMs that explore their impacts across the
   spectrum of well-being. By coupling quantitative indicators and QNMs, we
   were able to demonstrate how adaptive strategies can be examined to
   capture the multi-faceted well-being effects of fisheries participants'
   adaptations to changing conditions. This study directly addresses
   several of the key guiding principles of the U.S. EBFM Road Map,
   including advancing our understanding of ecosystem processes, exploring
   trade-offs within an ecosystem, and maintaining resilient ecosystems,
   inclusive of community well-being. Thus this paper demonstrates how
   coupled socio-ecological models can elevate the inclusion of human
   adaptive behaviors, providing a framework for the development of
   policymaking that can mitigate adverse effects on both the participants
   and the resource by facilitating the mixture of adaptive strategies that
   maximizes desired well-being outcomes.},

Abstract = {The future will be warmer with more tropical days, heat stress and
   related impacts for the healthy and liveable city. This is clear from
   many scientific studies and papers. Yet many local governments in the
   Netherlands claim to have insufficient understanding of the importance
   of these impacts in order to make the necessary step to climate
   adaptation and to take practical actions to manage the risks associated
   with rising heat levels. They struggle with defining the urgency of heat
   stress and finding good arguments for the need to adapt urban
   environments to rising temperatures. In order to provide urban
   professionals with reasons to adapt their urban environments to heat, we
   analyzed the potential impacts of urban heat from international policy
   reports and scientific literature. We summarized the impacts in a mind
   map. This map visualizes the large number and variety of heat-related
   risks. They can be subdivided into risks for health, open space,
   liveability, water and infrastructure networks. We believe that this
   mind map provides useful insight into the reasons to take heat
   adaptation actions. It can also be a helpful visual for urban
   professionals in outlining the reasons to take action for heat
   adaptation. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
