Abstract = {The climate resilience of river deltas is threatened by rising sea
   levels, accelerated land subsidence, and reduced sediment supply from
   contributing river basins. Yet, these uncertain and rapidly changing
   threats are rarely considered in conjunction. Here we provide an
   integrated assessment, on basin and delta scales, to identify key
   planning levers for increasing the climate resilience of the Mekong
   Delta. We find, first, that 23 to 90\% of this unusually productive
   delta might fall below sea level by 2100, with the large uncertainty
   driven mainly by future management of groundwater pumping and associated
   land subsidence. Second, maintaining sediment supply from the basin is
   crucial under all scenarios for maintaining delta land and enhancing the
   climate resilience of the system. We then use a bottom-up approach to
   identify basin development scenarios that are compatible with
   maintaining sediment supply at current levels. This analysis highlights,
   third, that strategic placement of hydropower dams will be more
   important for maintaining sediment supply than either projected
   increases in sediment yields or improved sediment management at
   individual dams. Our results demonstrate 1) the need for integrated
   planning across basin and delta scales, 2) the role of river sediment
   management as a nature-based solution to increase delta resilience, and
   3) global benefits from strategic basin management to maintain resilient
   deltas, especially under uncertain and changing conditions.},

Abstract = {In an interdisciplinary project involving life, engineering and
   socio-economic sciences, the sensitivity to climate change of the
   hydrologic, ecological and socio-economic properties of the inner Weser
   estuary and its marshes are analysed and different response strategies
   are developed and evaluated. To manage the complex interdisciplinary
   research process, the project has been organised with a stringent
   `vertical' and `horizontal' structure. The `scenario approach' is used
   to take uncertainty into account. The climate change scenario for the
   year 2050 includes a sea level rise, an increase in tidal amplitude and
   mean temperature (especially in spring and winter) and an increase in
   precipitation and wind speed. In the absence of countermeasures a
   multitude of `negative' primary effects can be expected, including
   overtopping of dikes by waves, submersion of forelands, changes in
   freshwater inflow, residence time and water quality in the estuary and
   water levels in the drainage systems of the marshes. However, the
   overall impact for the region can primarily be assessed as `medium' and,
   if possible mitigating measures are taken into account, overall impact
   should be `low'.},

Title = {Abating heat waves in a coastal Mediterranean city: What can cool roofs
   and vegetation contribute?},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The frequency and intensity of heat waves (HW) in cities are on the rise
   due to climate change as well as urban fabric materials and
   anthropogenic activities that affect heat accumulation. The efficacy of
   HW mitigation strategies depends on a city's specific and unique
   morphology, land use, building materials, climate and geography. In this
   study, we show the effectiveness of cool roofs and vegetation in
   reducing temperature in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (AMB). We use
   the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model with the urban scheme
   BEP+BEM, including11 urban classes to simulate a HW that occurred in
   August 2015. We find that cool roofs reduce temperature best during the
   day (0.67 ?C average and 2.22 ?C maximum reductions), while additional
   green areas moderate temperatures to a lesser degree but also more
   evenly during the day and at night (average reductions of 0.15 ?C and
   0.17 ?C, respectively). However, when irrigation is increased, the
   temperature reduction during the day is intensified due to the cooling
   effect of more evapotranspiration. The thermal regulation of combining
   the two strategies is the most evenly distributed over the AMB and has
   the highest impact, with an average and maximum reduction of 1.26 ?C and
   4.73 ?C at 13:00UTC.},

Abstract = {The rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the
   early twenty-first century is intimately entwined with the health and
   functioning of the biosphere. Climate change is impacting ecosystems
   through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability, coupled
   with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and
   atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It also interacts with other
   pressures on ecosystems, including degradation, defaunation and
   fragmentation. There is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of
   these climate impacts, to identify hotspots of vulnerability and
   resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist
   biosphere resilience to climate change. At the same time, ecosystems can
   also assist in the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The
   mechanisms, potential and limits of such nature-based solutions to
   climate change need to be explored and quantified. This paper introduces
   a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and
   the biosphere. It explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond
   to climate change, how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how
   ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate.
   It draws on a Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum held in
   Washington DC in November 2018, where these themes and issues were
   discussed. We conclude by identifying some priorities for academic
   research and practical implementation, in order to maximize the
   potential for maintaining a diverse, resilient and well-functioning
   biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty-first century.
   This article is part of the theme issue `Climate change and ecosystems:
   threats, opportunities and solutions'.},

Abstract = {Complex landscapes interact with meteorological processes to generate
   climatically suitable habitat (refuges) in otherwise hostile
   environments. Locating these refuges has practical importance in
   tropical montane regions where a high diversity of climatically
   specialized species is threatened by climate change. Here, we use a
   combination of weather data and spatial modeling to quantify thermally
   buffered environments in a regional tropical rainforest. We do this by
   constructing a spatial surface of maximum air temperature that takes
   into account important climate-mediating processes. We find a strong
   attenuating effect of elevation, distance from coast and foliage cover
   on maximum temperature. The core habitat of a disproportionately high
   number of endemic species (45\%) is encompassed within just 25\% of the
   coolest identified rainforest. We demonstrate how this data can be used
   to (i) identify important areas of cool habitat for protection and (ii)
   efficiently guide restoration in degraded landscapes to expand extant
   networks of critical cool habitat.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Pages = {213-221},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Fostering sustainable local social ecological interactions playing out
   against a backdrop of larger-scale dynamics are ubiquitous challenges to
   natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.
   Social-ecological vulnerability assessments are highly relevant for
   place-based management and can help target and prioritize management
   actions. However, an understanding of how linked social-ecological
   vulnerabilities respond to external drivers is still lacking. This paper
   presents an approach that integrates the spatial and temporal dimensions
   into social-ecological vulnerability assessments, where social and
   ecological vulnerabilities are linked by a feedback loop. The approach
   is applied to the Moorea coral reef social-ecological system, which has
   been significantly influenced by major environmental and social drivers
   over the last decade. Temporal changes in linked social-ecological
   vulnerabilities are mapped before and after exposure to the multiple
   drivers. Nearly 23\% of households and 13\% of the reef area show low
   and decreasing vulnerability despite exposure. However, high and
   increasing levels of vulnerability were detected in 6\% of households
   and associated reefs after exposure to the drivers, providing early
   warnings of potentially unsustainable situations. Importantly, changes
   in ecological vulnerability did not propagate linearly to changes in
   social vulnerability. Similarly, hot spots of social vulnerability were
   not necessarily associated with hot spots of ecological vulnerability,
   highlighting the need to specifically adapt management interventions to
   local social-ecological settings. Mapping social-ecological dependencies
   in space and time provides communities and decision-makers with the
   information required to identify and prioritize management interventions
   while accounting for the effects of large-scale or external drivers.},

Abstract = {Storm overwash is a critical issue in coastal management efforts to
   mitigate damage to infrastructure. This paper contributes to those
   efforts by documenting the findings of a field survey at the Perdido
   Key, Florida, section of Gulf Islands National Seashore following the
   landfall of tropical cyclone Isidore in September 2002. The poststorm
   survey of overwash sites detected scouring along the northern edge of an
   access road that faced away from the Gulf of Mexico and the oncoming
   storm surge. Most sites experienced removal of minor amounts of sand and
   roadbed material, which left the edge of the overlying asphalt road
   surface unsupported. However, more severe scouring at one site caused
   the overlying asphalt road surface to fracture and collapse. An extreme
   example of this process was observed following the landfall of Hurricane
   Opal at Pensacola Beach, Florida, in 1995. The scouring process and its
   effects were consistent with a process recognized in fluvial systems as
   knickpoint development. Related scouring processes known as hydraulic
   jump and dam overtopping are also discussed. Coastal management options
   for mitigating this problem include reducing overwash and increasing
   resistance to scour. Methods to protect dams from overtopping offer
   potential solutions to this problem. An alternative solution is proposed
   that would offer protection against minor overwash events; however, it
   is unlikely that any of the methods discussed herein would be highly
   effective against an extreme event like Hurricane Opal.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to enhance understanding of how the resilience
   of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) systems to hazards can be
   improved. In turn, this aims to inform different strategies for public
   and private partnerships (PPPs). In a new approach, to acknowledge the
   multi levelled nature of resilience; risk at the relevant levels are
   taken into account, (regional/river basin, urban area, and individual).
   For these levels, we first describe the different components of risk,
   vulnerability and resilience of the WASH system that influence people's
   exposure to hazards. We illustrate these components using examples from
   case studies in the literature. Using a social learning lens - a crucial
   ingredient of resilience - we examine opportunities for reducing risks
   through improving public-private engagement. These are presented as
   strategies which could guide investment decisions: As pressures from
   climate change and development add up, businesses must become aware of
   the risks involved in operating and investing without considering
   ecosystem health, both in terms of the services they provide for
   mitigating floods and droughts, as well as in terms of the development
   approaches that define how ecosystems are managed (e.g. ``making
   space{''} for, rather than controlling water). There is a need to
   develop an institutional culture that strives towards greener and more
   resilient urban environments with the help of various quality assurance
   methods. Partnerships must reach the poorer customer base, encourage
   informal small entrepreneurs, and boost financial mechanisms (e.g, micro
   insurance, micro finance) to support the most vulnerable in society. (C)

Title = {Urban Heat Island Studies with emphasis on urban pavements: A review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Increase in urban population across the globe has resulted in drastic
   rise in anthropogenic activities and urban surface modifications. These
   contribute to the hike of urban temperature above the temperature of
   surrounding rural areas. When this happens, the city is said to
   experience Urban Heat Island (UHI). This paper presents a review of
   available literatures on the subject matter of UHI with peculiar
   emphasis on urban pavements. Information on the state of the art of UHI
   measurement, evaluation, and mitigation is reported. The causes,
   effects, and spatio-temporal variations in UHI events were studied and
   discussed. Addressing the harmful effects of UHI would involve adoption
   of effective mitigation strategies that can improve the environmental,
   societal, and economic sustainability of urban structures and
   landscapes. Implementation of innovative designs of urban pavements to
   ensure lower surface temperature was generally recommended. The use of
   vegetative covers, reflective surfaces, water retaining materials, and
   heat capturing devices were found to be effective. The facts presented
   in this paper are very expedient to inform policy making and guide to
   future studies that can lead to more innovative engineering designs of
   sustainable urban pavements for UHI mitigation.},

Title = {Assessing institutional capacities to adapt to climate change:
   integrating psychological dimensions in the Adaptive Capacity Wheel},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3369-3384},
Abstract = {Several case studies show that social factors like institutions,
   perceptions and social capital strongly affect social capacities to
   adapt to climate change. Together with economic and technological
   development they are important for building social capacities.
   However, there are almost no methodologies for the systematic assessment
   of social factors. After reviewing existing methodologies we identify
   the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW) by Gupta et al. (2010), developed for
   assessing the adaptive capacity of institutions, as the most
   comprehensive and operationalised framework to assess social factors.
   The ACW differentiates 22 criteria to assess 6 dimensions: variety,
   learning capacity, room for autonomous change, leadership, availability
   of resources, fair governance.
   To include important psychological factors we extended the ACW by two
   dimensions: ``adaptation motivation{''} refers to actors' motivation to
   realise, support and/or promote adaptation to climate; ``adaptation
   belief{''} refers to actors' perceptions of realisability and
   effectiveness of adaptation measures.
   We applied the extended ACW to assess adaptive capacities of four
   sectors - water management, flood/coastal protection, civil protection
   and regional planning - in northwestern Germany. The assessments of
   adaptation motivation and belief provided a clear added value. The
   results also revealed some methodological problems in applying the ACW
   (e.g. overlap of dimensions), for which we propose methodological
   solutions.},

Abstract = {Rotational Energy Harvesting becomes increasingly important for rotating
   sensor applications. Most of these applications rotate with changing
   revolution speed, which is a significant challenge for the energy
   harvesting system. This work presents an energy harvesting system for
   rotational motion with a new power management concept to generate energy
   for a wireless condition monitoring system. The challenge is to generate
   enough energy with a high efficiency factor at the minimum revolution
   speed but also to avoid problems with energy excess and high voltages at
   the maximum revolution speed. The power management includes solid state
   relays for coil switching to avoid the generation of excess energy that
   would lead to increased temperature. At 500 rpm the energy harvester
   generates 193 mW. With an efficiency of 54\% the power management
   provides an output power of 106 mW.},

Title = {Impact of justice and solidarity variables on the acceptability of
   managed realignment},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {361-377},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise due to climate change will have significant effects on
   coastal areas and populations. Adaptation policies recommend the managed
   realignment of the most vulnerable assets and activities. Despite their
   medium-and long-term benefits, these policies face significant friction
   due to social acceptability in the communities where they are
   implemented.
   This article investigates the hypothesis that respecting principles of
   justice in the implementation of managed realignment should increase its
   acceptability. We compare preferences of those people who are exposed to
   the risk of climate-change-induced flooding and those who are not, as
   regards funding managed retreat policies and defining compensation
   criteria for assets at risk. The main theories of social justice provide
   the four principles included in the analysis: efficiency, need,
   responsibility and priority assigned to property rights.
   A choice experiment survey was conducted with 258 residents of coastal
   and hinterland communities in the south of France. Four attributes were
   selected to define the managed realignment policy: the dialogue
   arrangements, the implementation period, the policy implementation
   schedule and the cost. The results show support for a relatively fast
   launch of these policies (within 15 years) but in stages and through a
   process of dialogue with the population. People's perceptions of the
   funding criteria reveal a preference for national solidarity. Finally,
   national funding of managed retreat policies and compensation criteria
   based on market prices have a significant positive influence on the
   acceptability of managed realignment policies, whereas introducing
   responsibility-based compensation criteria tends to favour the status
   quo over the adaptation policy.
   Policy relevance
   Prioritization of the funding criteria reveals the preference for
   national solidarity. Preferences for the justice criteria underpinning
   compensation reveal a great diversity of values. Besides implantation
   modalities, preferences for managed realignment policies depend on which
   level they are implemented at, on the expropriation criteria (the
   emphasis given to property rights, i.e. market price), on the attachment
   (people perceived as worst off, i.e. the property is their main
   residence rather than a second home or they have lower levels of income)
   and on the degree of responsibility (related to the date of purchase,
   i.e. on the information given at the time on the risk).},

Abstract = {Global biodiversity is increasingly threatened by habitat loss, climate
   change, and biological invasion. However, predictions of impacts on
   native fauna are hampered by an inadequate knowledge of how these
   factors interact and how climate change will affect the distribution,
   abundance, and behaviour of both native and invasive species, not least
   as most predictions are based on the long-term effects of temperature
   alone. Here, we present a case study illustrating how local-scale
   climate change impacts (increased temperature, reduced rainfall, shifts
   in peak rainfall) affected the hydrology of a channelised lowland
   European river (reduced flow, reduction in flood events, increased
   siltation, macrophyte growth), allowing native fish species to
   recolonise the bankside zone and reducing the density of invasive round
   gobyNeogobius melanostomusby removing its preferred habitat. While most
   studies predict long-term negative impacts on global fish populations,
   some suggest potential direct and indirect benefits at a local scale. We
   are of the opinion that, at a local scale, climate change impacts on
   fish will be more nuanced and complex than long-term predictions
   suggest, resulting in both positive and negative effects,
   withconsolation prizesin the face of larger losses. While impacts on
   fish will differ between regions and/or continents, depending on the
   specific impacts of climate change, identification of positive effects
   will be essential in clarifying long-range forecasts and identifying
   management procedures for mitigating overall negative impacts.},

Title = {Southern Ocean fishery management - Is CCAMLR addressing the challenges
   posed by a changing climate?},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change is having far reaching effects on the marine environment.
   Often considered a pristine and isolated region, the Southern Ocean is
   becoming increasingly more affected by the impacts of climate change.
   The legal framework governing fisheries and protecting the marine
   environment of the Southern Ocean is both global and regional. On the
   global level, most of the waters around Antarctica fall under the high
   seas regime of the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),
   although seven states have asserted a claim to the territorial sea
   adjacent to their Antarctic territories under the Antarctic Treaty. On a
   regional level, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
   Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages fisheries. As climate change will
   inevitably have impacts on the Southern Ocean, it is important to assess
   how the current legal framework addresses this issue. The
   recommendations for climate change adaptation given by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are threefold:
   international cooperation, precautionary approach and ecosystem
   approach. By evaluating the extent to which these recommendations have
   been implemented in the global and regional legal frameworks, the
   flexibility and resilience to tackle climate change of the provisions
   can be assessed. On the global level, specific provisions from UNCLOS
   and the Fish Stock Agreement (FSA) provide for both the precautionary
   and ecosystem approaches. Regionally, CCAMLR has shown to be at the
   forefront in integrating the precautionary and ecosystem approaches in
   fishery management, providing an example of sustainable adaptation
   strategies for other Regional Fisheries Management Organizations
   (RFMOs).},

Title = {Quantification of blue carbon in seagrass ecosystems of Southeast Asia
   and their potential for climate change mitigation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {783},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Seagrasses have the ability to contribute towards climate change
   mitigation, through large organic carbon (C-org) sinks within their
   ecosystems. Although the importance of blue carbon within these
   ecosystems has been addressed in some countries of Southeast Asia, the
   regional and national inventories with the application of nature-based
   solutions are lacking. In this study, we aim to estimate national
   coastal blue carbon stocks in the seagrass ecosystems in the countries
   of Southeast Asia including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India.
   This study further assesses the potential of conservation and
   restoration practices and highlights the seagrass meadows as
   nature-based solution for climate change mitigation. The average value
   of the total carbon storage within seagrass meadows of this region is
   121.95 +/- 76.11 Mg ha(-1) (average +/- SD) and the total C-org stock of
   the seagrass meadows of this region was 429.11 +/- 111.88 Tg, with the
   highest C-org stock in the Philippines (78\%). The seagrass meadows of
   this region have the capacity to accumulate 5.85-6.80 Tg C year(-1),
   which accounts for \$214.6-249.4 million USD. Under the current rate of
   decline of 2.82\%, the seagrass meadows are emitting 1.65-2.08 Tg of CO2
   year(-1) and the economic value of these losses accounts for
   \$21.42-24.96 million USD. The potential of the seagrass meadows to the
   offset current CO2 emissions varies across the region, with the highest
   contribution to offset is in the seagrass meadows of the Philippines
   (11.71\%). Current national policies and commitments of nationally
   determined contributions do not include blue carbon ecosystems as
   climate mitigation measures, even though these ecosystems can contribute
   up to 7.03\% of the countries' reduction goal of CO2 emissions by 2030.
   The results of this study highlight and promote the potential of the
   southeast Asian seagrass meadows to national and international agencies
   as a practical scheme for nature-based solutions for climate change
   mitigation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To examine the effectiveness of the paired tori lines (PT) for reducing
   seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, bait attack behaviors
   during PT deployment was compared with that during single tori line (ST)
   deployment. Detailed observations of seabird species abundance and
   attacks on baits were conducted from a longliner operating in the
   western North Pacific from December 2010 to January 2011. Line settings
   alternated between ST and PT deployments. About 90\% of the seabirds
   attending the vessel were Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis),
   and most attacks were by this species. Attacks occurred across broad
   areas from 25 to 200 m of the stern during ST deployments, whereas PT
   deployment resulted in few attacks within 75 m of the stern. The number
   of secondary attacks (birds charging for the bait brought to the surface
   by the bird making the primary attack) was significantly lower during PT
   than during ST deployment. These results suggest that PT performed
   better than ST in reducing bait attacks, and consequently seabird
   mortality. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aerial videotape-assisted vulnerability analysis (AVVA) technique
   was combined with various data sets to assess the vulnerability of the
   coastal zone of The Gambia to sea level rise. Land loss due to
   inundation, flooding, and erosion was estimated. Costs of damage and
   population at risk were also evaluated. Only historical data and maps
   were used to assess the vulnerability of the coastal zone of the Abidjan
   region of Cote d'Ivoire to sea level rise. Results show that with a 1 m
   sea level rise the whole of the capital city of Banjul will be under
   mean sea level in the next 50 to 60 yr as a greater part of the city is
   below 1 m. The mangrove systems on St. Mary's Island, Kombo St. Mary,
   and the strand plains in the north bank will be inundated. About 1950
   billion Dalasis (US \$217 million) worth of land will be lost. The most
   appropriate response would be to protect the whole of the coastline of
   Banjul, the shoreline area from the Banjul cemeteries to Laguna Beach
   Hotel, the infrastructure at Sarro, and the hotel complex at Cape Point.
   Innovative sand management, repair of the damaged groins, and
   construction of dikes, breakwater structures, revetments, and low-cost
   seawall are some of the shoreline stabilization and hardening techniques
   suggested for the protection of this area. For the Abidjan region, the
   same response strategies should be used. Adaptation responses identified
   for both regions include public awareness, increase in height of coastal
   infrastructure, urban growth planning, wetland preservation and
   mitigation, and development of a coastal zone management plan.},

Abstract = {Despite global mitigation efforts, climate change will impact the City
   of Vancouver's future. One anticipated impact, sea level rise, is
   described. A comprehensive understanding of the consequences of these
   impacts is necessary to guide the process of identifying preferred
   adaptation strategies. A methodology for a coastal flood risk assessment
   (CFRA) of sea level rise is provided. The inputs for this risk
   assessment include inundation mapping and an asset-at-risk inventory.
   These data sets are combined with flood damage information from Hazus to
   look at consequences of coastal flooding. There are many uncertainties
   and gaps in the process of developing a CFRA for a modern, dense, urban
   city such as Vancouver, particularly when the planning timelines
   required for preparing and adapting to sea level rise are long. The
   value of the process and results include increased understanding of
   hazards and vulnerabilities, and the development of useful visual tools
   for engagement, planning and education.},

Abstract = {Whilst Africa is among the most vulnerable regions to climate change,
   relevant scenario models suggests that Eastern Africa will be among the
   regions with the largest decline in agricultural yields in the continent
   due to increasing mean surface temperatures and GHG concentrations.
   Climate change impacts in the Eastern African region will include an
   acceleration of the hydrologic cycle, occasioning increased variance in
   rainfall. This will particularly impact dryland environments due to
   their climate sensitive production systems and low adaptive capacities.
   Context specific adaptive responses will be necessary to reduce
   vulnerability of communities to environmental change, hence increasing
   their resilience to climate variability. Such adaptive solutions will
   require, among others, the building of institutional capacity in
   technology and governance particularly in the food, energy and water
   nexus. Appropriate technologies such as rainwater harvesting systems,
   can be applied for supplemental irrigation, and in conjunction with good
   agricultural technologies, would ensure food, energy and water security
   at the household level among the small holders. This chapter discusses
   regional strategies to address food security, energy needs and water
   resources in the Eastern African region. It postulates that current
   sectoral approach is not sustainable and therefore provides a nexus
   perspective, based on use of Rainwater Harvesting Technologies at the
   farm level, as a step towards sustainability.},

Abstract = {The Paiva River catchment, located in Portugal, integrates the Natura
   2000 network of European Union nature protection areas. Resorting to
   topography, climate and land-use data, a semi-distributed hydrological
   model (Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN) was run in order to
   simulate the hydrological cycle of the river and its tributaries. The
   model was calibrated over a 25-year period and validated within a
   31-year period. Its performance was verified by comparing the recorded
   and simulated daily flows. The values of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient
   of efficiency of 0.95 and 0.76, and coefficient of determination of 0.95
   and 0.82, were achieved for calibration and validation, respectively,
   thus showing a quite satisfactory model performance. Subsequently, the
   climate change impacts on temperature and precipitation, as well as
   their extremes, and on the flowrates were also assessed for a future
   period (2041-2070) under two anthropogenic forcing scenarios
   (representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5). A procedure for
   selecting the most relevant metrics for assessing the ecological
   condition of the Paiva River was developed based upon a set of 52
   invertebrate families sampled. Correspondence analyses were carried out
   for biological datasets (traits/metrics) with physicochemical and land
   use/land cover matrices separately. Out of all variables, water quality
   and flow and agriculture land use explained most of the variance
   observed. The integrated analysis undertaken in the present study is an
   important advance when compared to previous studies and it provides key
   information to stakeholders and decision-makers, particularly when
   planning suitable adaptation measures to cope with changing climates in
   the forthcoming decades.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategy to
   integrate climate change adaptation (CCA) in public asset management
   (PAM) in Indonesia. This paper focusses on public buildings as part of a
   public asset.
   Design/methodology/approach - As an archipelagic country, Indonesia is
   very vulnerable to sea-level rise as a result of climate change. The
   outcomes of a qualitative analysis of interviews with relevant
   stakeholders were used for the development of the CCA framework in an
   Indonesian context.
   Findings - The study identified that the integration of CCA in PAM in
   Indonesia requires the incorporation of nine key elements. These are as
   follows: recognition of climate change; risk management and insurance
   schemes for assets; integrated asset management and planning; asset use
   and knowledge; reliable, accessible and understandable data set on
   climate change; leadership, government commitment and incentives;
   involvement of research and private entities; community engagement; and
   coordination of relevant agencies.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper informed only the key
   elements required on the development of framework which integrate CCA in
   PAM. Practical implications - The integration of CCA to a PAM framework
   will support the development of policies and procedures for
   better-informed decisions.
   Social implications - The framework increases opportunities for
   stakeholders and community engagement in policy development and decision
   making in relation to CCA for public assets.
   Originality/value - This paper synthesises CCA and PAM using knowledge
   from the three levels of governments in Australia and Indonesia. CCA and
   PAM groups work separately in Indonesia and integration will reduce
   climate change risks and improve decision making in PAM.},

Title = {Mangrove Rehabilitation and Restoration as Experimental Adaptive
   Management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Rehabilitated and restored mangrove ecosystems have important
   ecological, economic, and social values for coastal communities.
   Although a sine qua non of successful mangrove rehabilitation or
   restoration projects is accurate attention to local hydrology and basic
   biology of mangrove trees and their associated fauna, their long-term
   success depends on far more axes, each with their own challenges.
   Rehabilitation projects: are planned, designed, executed, and managed by
   people with diverse backgrounds and different scientific and
   socio-political agendas; need to be responsive to these multiple
   stakeholders and agents who hold different values; are often influenced
   by laws and treaties spanning local to international scales; and must be
   able to adapt and evolve both geomorphologically and socioeconomically
   over decades-to-centuries in the context of a rapidly changing climate.
   We view these challenges as opportunities for innovative approaches to
   rehabilitation and restoration that engage new and larger
   constituencies. Restored mangrove ecosystems can be deliberately
   designed and engineered to provide valuable ecosystem services, be
   adaptable to climatic changes, and to develop platforms for educating
   nonspecialists about both the successes and failures of restored
   mangrove ecosystems. When mangrove rehabilitation or restoration
   projects are developed as experiments, they can be used as case-studies
   and more general models to inform policy- and decision-makers and guide
   future restoration efforts. Achieving this vision will require new
   investment and dedication to research and adaptive management practices.
   These ideas are illustrated with examples from mangrove restoration and
   rehabilitation projects in the Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean regions,
   the two hotspots of mangrove biodiversity and its ongoing loss and
   degradation.},

Title = {Decision support tool to mitigate ship-induced erosion in non-uniform,
   sheltered coastal fairways},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The negative impact of maritime traffic in terms of shore erosion in
   sheltered coastal fairways can be mitigated by sustainable fairway
   management. Mitigation measures include regulating the ship traffic in
   terms of speed, routes, or size of ships, but can also involve erosion
   protection along a fairway. For effective shoreline management of a
   fairway, it is essential to predict ship waves, to identify sites with
   potential erosion problems, and to investigate the effectiveness of
   different measures before implementing them. Several attempts have been
   made to develop site-specific criteria for managing ship waves. However,
   few available generic models consider primary waves generated by large
   ships in confined fairways. Therefore, a tool for supporting decisions
   in fairway management was developed. The decision support tool is based
   on simplified formulas for ship-and wind-wave prediction, combined in a
   framework that enables automatic, rapid assessments on large spatial and
   temporal scales. Moreover, the tool requires only readily available
   input data, such as data on AIS, bathymetry, shoreline geometry, wind,
   fairway centreline, and grain size. The output from the model includes
   ship and wind wave heights and potential erosion sites. The decision
   support tool was applied to the Furusund Fairway, Sweden, by simulating
   one year of ship traffic to validate its capability of identifying
   potential erosion sites. The simulation demonstrated that the tool was
   capable of identifying known erosion sites in the fairway. Additionally,
   scenarios with different speed regulation strategies for the Furusund
   Fairway were investigated using the decision support tool. Overall, it
   is concluded that the developed tool enables rapid assessment of ship
   waves, wind waves, and potential erosion over large areas in fairways.},

Title = {A human-centred assessment framework to prioritise heat mitigation
   efforts for active travel at city scale},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {763},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but
   also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel
   options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal
   environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that
   are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas
   in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper,
   we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to
   delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective
   outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images
   and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective
   of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree
   shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental
   and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of
   spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view
   (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning
   model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types
   and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is
   metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of
   heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute
   to sustainable development by developing a method to identify
   geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and
   enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation
   strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce
   significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used
   to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Pages = {375-395},
Abstract = {Fishers and scientists have known for over 100 years that the status of
   fish stocks can be greatly influenced by prevailing climatic conditions.
   Based on historical sea surface temperature data, the North Sea has been
   identified as one of 20 `hot spots' of climate change globally and
   projections for the next 100 years suggest that the region will continue
   to warm. The consequences of this rapid temperature rise are already
   being seen in shifts in species distribution and variability in stock
   recruitment. This chapter reviews current evidence for climate change
   effects on fisheries in the North Sea-one of the most important fishing
   grounds in the world-as well as available projections for North Sea
   fisheries in the future. Discussion focuses on biological, operational
   and wider market concerns, as well as on possible economic consequences.
   It is clear that fish communities and the fisheries that target them
   will be very different in 50 or 100 years' time and that management and
   governance will need to adapt accordingly.},

Title = {Spatial risk assessment of global change impacts on Swedish seagrass
   ecosystems},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Improved knowledge on the risk in ecologically important habitats on a
   regional scale from multiple stressors is critical for managing
   functioning and resilient ecosystems. This risk assessment aimed to
   identify seagrass ecosystems in southern Sweden that will be exposed to
   a high degree of change from multiple global change stressors in mid-
   and end-of-century climate change conditions. Risk scores were
   calculated from the expected overlap of three stressors: sea surface
   temperature increases, ocean acidification and wind driven turbid
   conditions. Three high-risk regions were identified as areas likely to
   be exposed to a particularly high level of pressure from the global
   stressors by the end of the century. In these areas it can be expected
   that there will be a large degree of stressor change from the current
   conditions. Given the ecological importance of seagrass meadows for
   maintaining high biodiversity and a range of other ecosystem services,
   these risk zones should be given high priority for incorporation into
   management strategies, which can attempt to reduce controllable
   stressors in order to mitigate the consequences of some of the impending
   pressures and manage for maintained ecosystem resilience.},

Title = {Potential vulnerability of Namaqualand plant diversity to anthropogenic
   climate change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {615-628},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We provide a position paper, using a brief literature review and some
   new modelling results for a subset of succulent plant species, which
   explores why Namaqualand plant diversity might be particularly
   vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change despite presumed species
   resilience under arid conditions, and therefore a globally important
   test-bed for adaptive conservation strategies. The Pleistocene
   climate-related evolutionary history of this region in particular may
   predispose Namaqualand (and Succulent Karoo) plant endemics to projected
   climate change impacts. Key Succulent Karoo plant lineages originated
   during cool Pleistocene times, and projected air temperatures under
   anthropogenic climate change are likely to exceed these significantly.
   Projected rainfall patterns are less certain, and projections of the
   future prevalence of coastal fog are lacking, but if either of these
   water inputs is reduced in concert with rising temperatures, this seems
   certain to threaten the persistence of, at least, narrow-endemic plant
   species. Simple modelling approaches show strong reduction in spatial
   extent of bioclimates typical of Namaqualand within the next five
   decades and that both generalist species with large geographic ranges,
   and narrow-range endemics may be susceptible to climate change induced
   loss of potential range. Persistence of endemics in micro-habitats that
   are buffered from extreme climate conditions cannot be discounted,
   though no attempts have been made to address this shortcoming of broader
   scale bioclimatic modelling. The few experimental data available on
   elevated temperature and drought tolerance suggest susceptibility of
   leaf succulent species, but high drought tolerance of non-succulent
   shrubs. Both species-level monitoring and further experimental work is
   essential to test and refine projections of climate change impacts on
   species persistence, and the implications for conservation. (c) 2007

Title = {Private sector climate change adaptation of accommodation suppliers in
   the small island of Koh Tao, Thailand},
Journal = {ASIAN GEOGRAPHER},
Abstract = {Small islands are often portrait as being among the most vulnerable
   tourism destinations to climate change, particularly to impacts from sea
   level rise. This raises the question of how, if at all, locally bound
   tourism stakeholders, such as accommodation suppliers, consider climate
   change risks and if they already invest in adaptation measures. The
   nature of the concepts of adaptation and adaptation finance, with a lack
   of universally accepted metrics for its monitoring, allow a theoretical
   inquiry if mobilized finance can be labeled being climate finance.
   Against this background, this study investigates to what extent
   accommodation owner-managers do recognize climate change in their
   strategic investment decisions. A survey with 112 respondents and
   in-depth interviews with 16 interviewees were conducted on Koh Tao,
   Thailand. The findings reveal that most businesses (private sector)
   already invest in adaptation, whereas it appears to be a rather reactive
   (unconscious) form of adaptation. This shows that the private sector has
   an interest in addressing business risks, including climate change. The
   accommodation suppliers themself, however, likely do not bother how
   actions that reduce their business risks in regard to natural hazards
   are being labeled. The findings also show that adaptation behavior of
   accommodation suppliers appears to be influenced by power dynamics on
   Koh Tao. There is a concentration of power among a few families. This
   can hinder a sustainable and climate risk-informed development pathway
   and investment decisions of individual accommodation businesses.},

Volume = {3},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {39-64},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Permafrost science and engineering are of vital importance for northern
   development and climate adaptation given that buildings, roads, and
   other infrastructure in many parts of the Arctic depend on permafrost
   stability. Permafrost also has wide-ranging effects on other features of
   the Arctic environment including geomorphology, biogeochemical fluxes,
   tundra plant and animal ecology, and the functioning of lake, river, and
   coastal marine ecosystems. This review presents an Earth system
   perspective on permafrost landscapes as an approach towards integration
   across disciplines. The permafrost system can be described by a
   three-layer conceptual model, with an upper buffer layer that contains
   vegetation or infrastructure. Snow and liquid water strongly affect the
   thermal properties and stability of these layers and their associated
   interfaces, resulting in critical times and places for accelerated
   degradation of permafrost and for exchanges of mass and heat with the
   hydrosphere and atmosphere. Northern permafrost landscapes are now in
   rapid transition as a result of climate warming and socioeconomic
   development, which is affecting their ability to provide geosystem and
   ecosystem services. The Earth system approach provides a framework for
   identifying linkages, thresholds, and feedbacks among system components,
   including human systems, and for the development of management
   strategies to cope with permafrost change.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Volume = {154},

Abstract = {Urban climate change phenomena, exacerbated by increasingly frequent
   heat waves, represent an urgent environmental research issue to be
   further investigated and counteracted through multidisciplinary
   approaches covering both engineering and socio-environmental sciences.
   After acknowledging that Urban Heat Island hugely affects building
   thermal-energy behavior, recent contributions deal with its effect on
   vulnerable population groups in terms of their exposure risk to health
   diseases even worsened by energy poverty. In this view, the paper
   investigates the role played by occupants' education and their knowledge
   of environmental risks and climate change-related events, by exploring
   the opportunity to improve their information level as trigger for
   improving their climate change behavioral resilience and reducing their
   health risk in the built environment during extreme events. To this aim,
   a novel widespread questionnaire was elaborated and submitted to more
   than 300 individuals with varying their educational background and
   personal characteristics, seasonal period, submission mode, temporal
   closeness to heat wave emergency. Key findings showed that participants'
   educational background represents a clear way to drive environmentally
   aware behaviors minimizing the consequent health risk imputable to urban
   overheating and other environmental hazards such as heat waves. In fact,
   a higher level of awareness and consciousness may lead to a better
   adaptation capability to such climate change related hazards since they

   demonstrated that informative campaigns may represent an effective

Title = {Analysis of the cooling effects of higher albedo surfaces during heat
   waves coupling the Weather Research and Forecasting model with building
   energy models},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {In this paper, the numerical Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
   model is coupled with a Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) and
   Building Energy Model (BEM) to investigate the effects on the urban
   microclimate and building energy demand of increasing the albedo of
   urban surfaces. For the scope of this study, while the WRP performs
   real-data applications numerical weather prediction, the BEP serves to
   predict the heat and moisture fluxes from the urban canopies to the
   atmosphere and the BEM simulates the effects of anthropogenic heat
   emissions. As such the overall simulations are capable of taking into
   account the several factors that influence the urban microclimate and
   couple their mutual interactions. Outdoor microclimate results for the
   air temperature and wind speed are compared against measurements in
   Toronto, ON, during the 2018 heatwave period. The validation confirms
   the reliability of the WRF model and the selected approach. Then, in
   order to assess possible urban heat island mitigation strategies, the
   albedos of roofs, walls, and ground surfaces are increased from 0.2 to
   0.65, 0.60, and 0.45, respectively. Results show that the maximum
   decrease in air temperature through these higher albedo values is nearly
   2 degrees C at noon with a slight increase in wind speed. Moreover, the
   daily averaged decrease in the urban surface temperature and in the
   absolute humidity is 3.3 degrees C and 0.6 gikg, respectively.
   Increasing the surface albedo would reduce the solar radiation balance
   at noon by almost 30W/m(2). Finally, the combined effect of decreased
   solar heat gains by urban surfaces and decreased air temperature would
   reduce the cooling energy demand by almost 10\%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {The ups and downs of hydropeaking: a Canadian perspective on the need
   for, and ecological costs of, peaking hydropower production},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {849},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {421-441},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hydropeaking refers to the mode of hydropower dam operation where
   sub-daily changes in flow are used to vary the generation of electricity
   in accordance with demand. A typical pattern produces maximum power
   during the day (i.e., the peak), and minimal power at night.
   Hydropeaking is considered necessary to stabilize the energy grid since
   it is the only reliably flexible method of producing electricity besides
   fossil fuels. With the planned phase-out of traditional coal-fired
   electricity production across Canada by 2030, and the increased reliance
   on intermittent wind and solar generation, the flexibility of
   hydropeaking will assume an increased importance. However, hydropower
   generation comes with costs; hydropeaking in particular is considered
   one of the most ecologically harmful modes of operation since downstream
   biota are subjected to flows that deviate greatly from typical natural
   flow regime patterns. The ecological effects of hydropeaking have been
   examined in a growing body of literature, but mitigation options do
   exist that include dam operational and/or structural modifications. This
   paper will explore the importance of hydropeaking in the Canadian
   electricity system, the ecological consequences of flexible hydropower,
   and mitigation options that could potentially strike a balance between
   meeting Canadian energy needs and minimizing ecosystem impacts.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {180-190},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Important intertidal coastal habitats - particularly mangroves,
   saltmarshes and beaches - are particularly threatened by the impacts of
   climate change-driven sea-level rise. Coastal development and coastal
   armoring present physical barriers for the natural inland migration of
   coastal habitats, and changes in hydrological connectivity reduce
   sediment inputs and the potential for vertical accretion. We identify
   mechanisms and enabling conditions to accommodate migration of these
   habitats in Australia and the United States. A range of financial,
   policy, planning and on-the-ground management tools in both countries
   that already exist, often for a different purpose, can be implemented or
   modified to also enable inland habitat migration. Awareness of
   approaches/solutions can assist land managers and policy makers to
   accommodate migration of habitats as a necessary component of coastal
   management in an era of increasing rates of sea level rise.},

Title = {Physiological responses of juvenile Chilean scallops (Argopecten
   purpuratus) to isolated and combined environmental drivers of coastal
   upwelling},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {76},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1836-1849},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal biota is exposed to continuous environmental variability as a
   consequence of natural and anthropogenic processes. Responding to
   heterogeneous conditions requires the presence of physiological
   strategies to cope with the environment. Ecosystems influenced by
   upwelling endure naturally cold, acidic and hypoxic conditions,
   nevertheless they sustain major fisheries worldwide. This suggests that
   species inhabiting upwelling habitats possess physiological adaptations
   to handle high environmental variability. Here, we assessed the impact
   of the main upwelling drivers (temperature, pH and oxygen) in isolation
   and combined on eco-physiological responses of Chilean scallop
   Argopecten purpuratus. A. purpuratus responded to hypoxia by increasing
   their metabolic performance to maintain growth and calcification.
   Calcification was only affected by pH and increased under acidic
   conditions. Further, A. purpuratus juveniles prioritized calcification
   at the expense of growth under upwelling conditions. Increasing
   temperature had a significant impact by enhancing the physiological
   performance of A. purpuratus juveniles independently of oxygen and pH
   conditions, but this was associated with earlier and higher mortalities.
   Our results suggest that A. purpuratus is acclimated to short-term
   colder, acidic and hypoxic conditions, and provide important information
   of how this species responds to the heterogeneous environment of
   upwelling, which is significantly relevant in the climatic context of
   upwelling intensification.},

Title = {How resilient is the Torres Strait Treaty (Australia and Papua New
   Guinea) to global change? A fisheries governance perspective},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {91},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Multi-lateral treaties are the primary institutional instrument for
   managing shared trans-national ecosystems, but their original designs
   may not be resilient to unanticipated global pressures. Here we evaluate
   the Torres Strait Treaty, which was ratified in 1985 to manage marine
   resources shared by Traditional Inhabitants from Western Province, Papua
   New Guinea (PNG) and the Torres Strait Islands of Australia. Since 1985
   rapid Asian economic growth has driven illegal fishing and trading
   practices amongst PNG fishers, and impacts from mining on PNG coastal
   settlements, exacerbated by relatively limited management capacity on
   the PNG side of the border. We evaluate the resilience of the Treaty to
   these unprecedented pressures by applying six design principles from the
   literature on resilient trans-boundary river basin treaties. Our
   analysis indicates that the Treaty's strengths lie in delegated
   inter-governmental organizations, conflict resolution and resource
   allocation mechanisms that account for variability. However, its
   weaknesses are due to the lack of formal review mechanisms, the absence
   of joint monitoring of potentially over-exploited species (sharks,
   barramundi, jewfish, mud crabs and reef fish), and low PNG capacity for
   enforcement. We present a `score-card' synthesising our evaluation, and
   recommend adaptive co-management processes that will enhance the
   resilience of the Treaty, including the regular review of the Treaty's
   structure and terms, and inclusion of external stakeholders related to
   cross-border trade with neighboring Indonesia, and PNG mining. We
   discuss the relevance of our approach for the design and evaluation of
   multi-lateral marine resource-sharing agreements, and regional security.},

Abstract = {Managed retreat is a potentially important climate change adaptation
   option, providing an alternative to structural protection or

   evaluate the drivers, barriers and outcomes of 27 recent cases of

   conceptual model based on two key factors-who benefits from retreat and
   who initiates it-organizes the diverse set of cases into four quadrants.
   Different sociopolitical dimensions emerge as particularly influential
   in each quadrant. The model establishes a foundation for understanding
   and anticipating case-specific complexities. It can be used to unpack
   the landscape of managed retreat and evaluate its potential future

Abstract = {The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated that the global surface temperature
   is likely to rise a further 1.1-6.4 degrees C during the twenty-first
   century, while studies by NASA indicate that the urban heat island
   effect over cities has resulted in an increase in rainfall over several
   urban areas. A major concern is the likely effects of changes in the
   frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, especially droughts
   and floods-{''}an increased risk of drought{''} while ``precipitation is
   projected to be concentrated into more intense events, with longer
   periods of little precipitation in between.{''} Cities/towns located on
   the coast, on river banks, upstream/downstream of dams, inland cities,
   and in hilly areas can all be affected. There has been an increasing
   trend of urban flood disasters in India over the past several years
   whereby major cities in India have been severely affected. The most
   notable amongst them are Hyderabad in 2000, Ahmedabad in 2001, Delhi in
   2002 and 2003, Chennai in 2004, Mumbai in 2005, Surat in 2006, Kolkata
   in 2007, Jamshedpur in 2008, Delhi 2009, and Guwahati and Delhi in 2010
   and again in September 2011. There is therefore an urgent need for
   adaptation and mitigation options for tackling the impacts of climate
   change on water resources, especially flooding from extreme rainfall.
   This paper describes the measures being taken at the local, national,
   and international level to make our cities flood resilient.},

Abstract = {It has been forecast that up to forty nation-states are at risk of
   disappearing due to rising sea levels related to climate warming. Such a
   situation would lead to a form of statelessness never experienced before
   in history and would raise serious concerns about migration as well as
   important legal questions. Although often mentioned in the media by NGOs
   and other international bodies, this issue has rarely been addressed by
   legal scholars or by social scientists specialized in migration studies.
   This chapter examines the available literature on the topic and presents
   basic geographic data to assess the validity of the danger. We then
   discuss the legal frameworks and policies that could be developed to
   mitigate the threat of climate change related statelessness, a concept
   that remains in need of clarification under both international law and
   human rights law. This chapter seeks to explore legal means to deal with
   populations displaced by the adverse impacts of climate change, that are
   consistent with a state's existing international legal obligations. The
   ongoing debate about this challenge aims to identify normative measures
   to secure a legal status for forced migrants, who risk becoming
   stateless when their state disappears.},

Abstract = {A LOICZ Budget Model is applied to the Ichkeul Lake, a wetland ecosystem
   of the South Mediterranean-North African region, to evaluate its
   functioning in order to boost water management. The Ichkeul Lake water
   and nutrient budget, net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), nutrient
   availability, and their seasonal changes are estimated using field data.
   A considerable anthropogenic-driven amount of nitrogen is transferred
   into N-2/N2O to the atmosphere during the dry season with predominance
   of denitrification-anammox processes. The primary production is impacted
   by forcing the ecosystem respiration to reduce the NEM so that the
   system is functioning as heterotrophic. Climate change and anthropogenic
   pressures are expected to exacerbate the current trends of water quality
   degradation, with possible negative impacts on Palearctic birds'
   population. Mitigation actions are possible, through the implementation
   of National Wetland Management Strategies that include nutrient load and
   water resources management.},

Abstract = {The study of the relationships existing between littoral transformation
   and climate change impacts-with associated hazards, vulnerabilities and
   risks represents the first step in the design of adaptation plans for
   coastal zones (risk reduction). Risk assessments provide information on
   the pressure to which the coastal zone is exposed and its adaptive
   capacity. In these assessments, it is important to examine interacting
   physical attributes and socio-economic, conservational and
   archeological/cultural characteristics. Determination of coastal
   susceptibility or vulnerability is an important instrument for
   managers/planners for coastal preservation, protection and development,
   as vulnerability outcomes provide baseline information and a scientific
   basis for any envisaged coastal erosion management plan together with
   mitigation measures under sustainability aspects. This chapter deals
   with a methodological approach to risk determination of extreme wave
   impacts. The approach is based on selection and evaluation of three
   types of variables: i) the forcing variables contributing to extreme
   wave-induced erosion, ii) dynamic variables that determine the
   resilience to erosion (susceptibility) and (iii) the vulnerable targets
   grouped in three different contexts (socio-economic, ecological and
   heritage). These are combined into two separate indices, the Hazard
   Index (combining forcing and susceptibility) and the Vulnerability
   Index, which together constitute the Coastline Risk to Extreme Waves as
   a single numerical measure of the risk for a given area. Maps generated
   with this methodology can be used as a guideline contributing to the
   determination of causes, processes and consequences derived from the
   extreme waves and associated processes.},

Title = {Performance assessment of seawater cooled chillers to mitigate urban
   heat island},
Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {175},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, nowadays accentuated by global
   warming, is growing its negative influence on urban resilience, building
   energy budget and human comfort during summer. To reduce UHI effect,
   mitigation strategies are normally focused on actions related to urban
   design like the use of high reflectivity surfaces and increase of
   vegetation. But, as concerns building anthropogenic heat, the benefits
   of a possible reduction of the heat released by air conditioning systems
   to neighborhoods are often underestimate. An effective solution consists
   in transporting the heat emitted by chiller condensers elsewhere by
   using water as heat transfer fluid. The systematic use of seawater to
   cool chillers in an urban area of a coastal city was investigated. The
   modification of the UHI phenomenon was studied as well as the
   consequences on building cooling demands and chiller performances
   assessed in dynamic conditions. Urban weather files in presence of
   different types of chillers were elaborated by Urban Weather Generator
   model. Building cooling demands in the area were evaluated by using
   archetype modeling approach and EnergyPlus model. The algorithm adopted
   to assess chiller performances takes into account also the effect of
   part load working condition. The comparison of seawater cooled chillers
   technology versus the more diffuse use of air cooled chillers highlights
   a significant UHI effect reduction which reaches 57\% during the night.
   As regards cooling demand increment caused by UHI, with seawater cooled
   chillers it is reduced of 58\%. In the end, thanks to lower demand and
   higher chiller efficiency, seawater cooling chillers achieve an energy
   saving of 23.5\%. Therefore this solution can foster the urban
   resilience and sustainability with an increasing contribution in front
   of the future climate scenario. Therefore, the introduction of a
   district cooling network is an important UHI mitigation strategy and its
   feasibility would have to be always verified between the possible
   actions.},

Abstract = {Oceanic top predators have ecological, social and economic value of
   global significance. These wide-ranging marine species, which include
   sharks, tunas and billfishes, marine mammals, turtles and seabirds, are
   the focus of international research attention under the Climate Impacts
   on Oceanic Top Predators (CLIOTOP) science programme, one of the
   Integrated Marine Biosphere Research (IMBeR) projects. Over more than a
   decade, research conducted under CLIOTOP has involved scientists from
   more than 30 countries, with international collaboration increasing
   markedly over time, and comparative analyses resulting in new knowledge
   and understanding of oceanic top predators. This special issue presents
   27 papers arising from the 3rd CLIOTOP symposium, held in San Sebastian,
   Spain in September 2015, spanning topics such as conservation biology,
   trophic ecology, fisheries science, climate change, and adaptive
   management. The maturation and synthesis of CLIOTOP's collaborative
   research is now resulting in real-world management applications and
   improving understanding of potential ecological and socio-economic
   impacts of climate change in oceanic systems. The ultimate CLIOTOP goal
   of preparing both climate-sensitive predator populations and the human
   societies dependent on them for the impending impacts of climate change
   is now within reach.},

Abstract = {Global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) stemming from the multiple effects of
   human-induced climate change has potentially dramatic effects for inland
   land use planning and habitability. Recent research suggests that GMSLR
   may endanger the low-elevation coastal zone sooner than expected,
   reshaping coastal geography, reducing habitable landmass, and seeding
   significant coastal out-migrations. Our research reviews the barriers to
   entry in the noncoastal hinterland. Using three organizing clusters
   (depletion zones, win lose zones, and no-trespass zones), we identify
   principal inland impediments to relocation and provide preliminary
   estimates of their toll on inland resettlement space. We make the case
   for proactive adaptation strategies extending landward from on global
   coastlines and illustrate this position with land use planning responses
   in Florida and China. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Volume = {143},

Abstract = {The challenges associated with managing systems of shallow coastal
   lagoons along a rapidly evolving coastline are illustrated in a case
   study of small lagoon systems in Ghana where these important structures
   are relied on by a range of different stakeholders for a variety of
   different purposes including fishing, tourism and salt production.
   Results of some water quality measurements are presented, showing that
   these lagoons have poor ecological status where they experience either a
   lack of flushing by the tide, or large amounts of anthropogenic inputs,
   or both. A vulnerability assessment is applied to the lagoons in
   question and this reveals a varying degree of threat from climate change
   to the operation and use of the lagoons. Our understanding of these
   systems suggests that a set of 10 hydrodynamic models, underpinned by an
   understanding of the local coastal sediment transport in each case, is
   appropriate, and could then be used to inform stakeholders and
   management in decision making. Integrated, broad ranging management
   strategies must adapt to the realities of climate change in order to
   allow the sustainable use of these lagoons in providing economic
   benefits, ecosystem services, and elements of coastline protection for
   the benefit of the local and regional population and its economy. (C)

Title = {Climate change impacts on the health of South Asian children and women
   subpopulations-A scoping review},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Climate change impacts are felt unequally
   worldwide; populations that experience geographical vulnerability, those
   living in small island states and densely populated coastal areas, and
   children and women are affected disproportionately. This scoping review
   aims to synthesize evidence from relevant studies centred on South Asia,
   identify research gaps specifically focused on children and women's
   health, and contribute to knowledge about South Asia's existing
   mitigation and adaptation strategies.Methods: A research librarian
   executed the search on six databases using controlled vocabulary (e.g.,
   MeSH, Emtree, etc.) and keywords representing the concepts ``vulnerable
   populations{''} and ``climate change{''} and ``health impacts{''} and
   ``South Asia.{''} Databases were searched from January 2010 to May 2020.
   Papers were screened independently by two researchers.Results: Forty-two
   studies were included, of which 23 were based in India, 14 in
   Bangladesh, and five in other South Asian countries. Nineteen studies
   focused on meteorological factors as the primary exposure. In contrast,
   thirteen focused on extreme weather events, nine on air pollution, and
   one on salinity in coastal areas. Thirty-four studies focused on the
   health impacts on children related to extreme weather events,
   meteorological factors, and air pollution, while only eight studies
   looked at health impacts on women. Undernutrition, ARI (acute
   respiratory infection), diarrheal diseases, low birth weight, and
   premature mortality were the major health impacts attributed to extreme
   weather events, meteorological factors, and air pollution exposure in
   children and women in the region.Conclusion: Extreme weather events,
   meteorological factors and air pollution have affected the health of
   children and women in South Asia. However, the gap in the literature
   across the South Asian countries concerning re-lationships between
   exposure to extreme weather events, meteorological factors, air
   pollution and health effects, including mental health problems in
   children and women, are opportunities for future work.},

Title = {Spatial Bayesian Network for predicting sea level rise induced coastal
   erosion in a small Pacific Island},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Pages = {341-351},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {An integrated approach combining Bayesian Network with GIS was developed
   for making a probabilistic prediction of sea level rise induced coastal
   erosion and assessing the implications of adaptation measures. The
   Bayesian Network integrates extensive qualitative and quantitative
   information into a single probabilistic model while GIS explicitly deals
   with spatial data for inputting, storing, analysing and mapping. The
   integration of the Bayesian Network with GIS using a cell-by-cell
   comparison technique (aka map algebra) provides a new tool to perform
   the probabilistic spatial analysis. The spatial Bayesian Network was
   utilised for predicting coastal erosion scenarios at the case study
   location of Tanna Island, Vanuatu in the South Pacific. Based on the
   Bayesian Network model, a rate of the island shoreline change was
   predicted probabilistically for each shoreline segment, which was
   transferred into GIS for visualisation purposes. The spatial
   distribution of shoreline change prediction results for various sea
   level rise scenarios was mapped. The outcomes of this work support
   risk-based adaptation planning and will be further developed to enable
   the incorporation of high resolution coastal process models, thereby
   supporting localised land use planning decisions.},

Abstract = {Climate change is credited with increased rainfall frequency and
   intensity. Rainfall intensity in engineering design or assessment is
   characterised from statistical analysis of historical records. A
   deviation from historical patterns introduces risk, particularly to
   existing structures, as the limits of past design methods are approached
   or exceeded. Such risk may be amplified and become difficult to predict
   if climate change combines with physical environmental changes. This
   paper makes reference to the importance of site observations in
   designing resilient solutions and highlights the tendency of current
   guidance/methods to be insufficient due to the lack of available
   assessment information. It provides guidance on the use of observed
   information to attain confidence in design parameters and presents
   equations for establishing current velocities for the design of rock
   scour protection or assessing observed scour conditions with limited
   unknown parameters.},

Title = {Morphological Development and Behaviour of a Shoreface Nourishment in
   the Portuguese Western Coast},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Current coastal protection strategy in Portugal defines beach and
   shoreface nourishment as a valid measure to mitigate coastal erosion in
   some erosional hot-spots, being considered as an adaptation measure
   under the present climate change scenario, including the impacts of sea
   level rise. However, scant objective data on shoreface nourishments are
   available to evaluate performance of this type of intervention in
   mitigating beach erosion and managing coast risk. We present the first
   monitoring results of a approximate to 2.4 x 10(6) m(3) shoreface
   nourishment on the Aveiro coast (Costa Nova-ilhavo), the largest until
   now in Portugal, focusing on its morphological development, impacts on
   adjacent beaches due to alongshore spreading and cross-shore
   redistribution, and contribution to the sediment budget of the nourished
   sediment cell. The analyses are based on high-resolution coastal
   monitoring data, provided by the Portuguese COaStal MOnitoring Program
   (COSMO). A Multiple Monitoring Cell (MMC) approach was used to evaluate
   local and feeder efficiency of the nourishment, sediment budget
   exchanges within both the placement and wider survey domains
   (approximate to 1 km(2) and 12 km(2), respectively). Results show rapid
   (ca. 6 months) morphological change over the placement area, with a
   decrease of about 40\% of the initial volume. Fast onshore sediment
   redistribution explains part of this change, placed sand having merged
   with the pre-existing bar system increased the volume of the shallower
   nearshore. Longshore transport is reflected by increasing the robustness
   of the bar downdrift of the placement area and also explains the
   negative sediment budget (0.75 x 10(6) m(3)) of the survey domain, which
   corresponds to losses through its southern boundary. Sediment spreading
   also induced accretion of the subaerial section of Costa Nova beaches in
   front of the placement area, reversing their long-term erosive trend. In
   contrast, this trend persisted at downdrift beaches. This suggests that
   the time lag of the subaerial beach response to this intervention
   increases with the distance to the placement area, and reversal of the
   erosive trend will only be noticeable in the following years. This study
   provides new insights on the time scales of beach response to
   high-magnitude shoreface interventions in high-energy wave-dominated
   sandy coasts, which will support decision making regarding similar
   operations designed to manage erosional hot-spots elsewhere.},

   adapting to sea level rise in the Inner Forth estuary, Scotland},

Abstract = {With climate change, coastal areas are faced with unprecedented sea
   level rise and flooding, raising questions as to how societies will
   choose to adapt. One option is to strengthen existing sea walls to
   maintain current land uses; however, scientists, policy-makers and
   conservationists increasingly see the benefits of managed realignment,
   which is a nature-based coastal adaptation that involves the conversion
   of reclaimed farmland back to wetlands, allowing periodic local flooding
   in designated areas to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. We
   interviewed 16 local organisations, landowners and farmers and held
   workshops with 109 citizens living the Inner Forth estuary in eastern
   Scotland, to examine how managed realignment is supported by stakeholder
   attitudes and their engagement. Most of the farmers we interviewed
   prefer strengthened sea walls, to maintain their livelihoods and
   agricultural heritage. Citizens and local organisations were mainly
   supportive of managed realignment, because it provided wildlife and
   flood regulation benefits. However, we identified several barriers that
   could present obstacles to implementing managed realignment, for
   example, uncertainty whether it would support their principles of
   economic and rational decision-making. Our findings suggest that the
   local capacity to cope with rising sea levels is limited by lack of
   engagement with all relevant stakeholder groups, the limited scope of
   existing stakeholder partnerships and poor short-term funding prospects
   of landscape partnerships that would facilitate collaboration and
   discussion. We suggest that including citizens, landowners, farmers and
   industries would strengthen existing stakeholder deliberation and
   collaboration, and support the Inner Forth's transition towards a more
   sustainable future shoreline.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},

Abstract = {One potential barrier to climate policy action is that individuals view
   climate change as a problem for people in other parts of the world or
   for future generations. As some scholars argue, risk messaging
   strategies that make climate change personally relevant may help
   overcome this barrier. In this article, we report a large-n survey
   experiment on San Francisco Bay Area residents to investigate how
   providing spatially-resolved risk information to individuals shapes
   their climate risk perceptions in the context of sea-level rise. Our
   results suggest that personalized risk messaging can sometimes reduce
   concern about sea-level rise. These experimental effects are limited to
   respondents who believe that climate change is happening. Further, we do
   not find an effect of providing local risk messages on an individual's
   willingness to pay for regional climate adaptation measures. Our results
   emphasize that local messaging strategies around sea-level rise risks
   may not have the clear impacts that some advocates and scholars presume.},

Title = {Plastic pioneers: Hominin biogeography east of the Movius Line during
   the Pleistocene},
Journal = {ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {181-192},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While the ``Movius Line{''} may no longer represent a valid cultural
   division between Early and Middle Pleistocene hominins in South and
   Southeast Asia, it still offers a useful geographical and ecological
   window into changing processes of colonization by different members of
   the genus Homo. In this paper, we initially review the
   palaeoenvironmental and cultural record associated with Homo erectus and
   Homo floresiensis to argue for a relatively homogeneous adaptive
   strategy utilized by hominins moving east of this notional line during
   the Early and Middle Pleistocene. We then contrast this to the rapid
   dispersal of Homo sapiens into South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
   Melanesia, from at least 45,000 years ago, associated with specialized
   subsistence and technological adaptations to a variety of environmental
   settings. While earlier members of our genus appear to have followed
   riverine and lacustrine corridors, whose situation varied with periods
   of climate change, Homo sapiens specialized in adaptations to tropical
   rainforests, faunally depauperate island settings, montane environments,
   and deep-water marine habitats. After evaluating whether this
   distinction may be one of taphonomic and survey bias, and reviewing
   potential methodological developments that may facilitate further
   investigation, we suggest that the adaptive and cultural plasticity of
   our species enabled pioneering colonization and occupation not
   previously seen in this part of the world. This plasticity allowed our
   species to remain in this region through ever-increasing climatic
   instability and become the last surviving hominin in Late Pleistocene
   South Asia and Sahul.},

Title = {Scepticism and perceived self-efficacy influence fishers' low risk
   perceptions of climate change},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Abstract = {Climate change is impacting fisheries globally, posing both risks and
   opportunities to those dependent on marine resources. Understanding how
   fishers perceive climate change, and what factors shape these
   perceptions, can provide insights into behavioural intentions and
   support required for climate change focused strategies and management.
   This study interviewed demersal fishers from a south-west UK fishing
   port to explore: 1) the future risks fishers identified that may affect
   their business and wider industry; 2) fishers' beliefs and risk
   perceptions relating to climate change; and 3) the factors influencing
   these perceptions. Fishers identified a number of environmental,
   socio-economic and fisheries governance risks but climate change was
   rarely mentioned. While fishers overall had low risk perceptions of
   climate change, these perceptions were heterogeneous across the sample.
   Climate change scepticism and a high perceived self-efficacy to adapt to
   climate change were associated with lower risk perceptions. These
   findings provide new insights into how fishers perceive climate change
   and, importantly, greater understanding of the possible drivers of such
   perceptions. Findings suggest that undertaking climate-awareness raising
   initiatives in isolation to support adaptation strategies could be
   limited in success. Instead, wider focus should be applied to removing
   barriers to adaptation, managing wider risks and incorporating fishers
   into decision making to effectively support and motivate fishers'
   adaptation.},

Title = {A Strategic Framework for Responding to Coral Bleaching Events in a
   Changing Climate},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The frequency and severity of mass coral bleaching events are predicted
   to increase as sea temperatures continue to warm under a global regime
   of rising ocean temperatures. Bleaching events can be disastrous for
   coral reef ecosystems and, given the number of other stressors to reefs
   that result from human activities, there is widespread concern about
   their future. This article provides a strategic framework from the Great
   Barrier Reef to prepare for and respond to mass bleaching events. The
   framework presented has two main inter-related components: an early
   warning system and assessment and monitoring. Both include the need to
   proactively and consistently communicate information on environmental
   conditions and the level of bleaching severity to senior
   decision-makers, stakeholders, and the public. Managers, being the most
   timely and credible source of information on bleaching events, can
   facilitate the implementation of strategies that can give reefs the best
   chance to recover from bleaching and to withstand future disturbances.
   The proposed framework is readily transferable to other coral reef
   regions, and can easily be adapted by managers to local financial,
   technical, and human resources.},

Title = {The WASCAL high-resolution regional climate simulation ensemble for West

Abstract = {Climate change and constant population growth pose severe challenges to
   21st century rural Africa. Within the framework of the West African
   Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),
   an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate change scenarios for the
   greater West African region is provided to support the development of
   effective adaptation and mitigation measures. This contribution presents
   the overall concept of the WASCAL regional climate simulations, as well
   as detailed information on the experimental design, and provides
   information on the format and dissemination of the available data. All
   data are made available to the public at the CERA long-term archive of
   the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) with a subset available at
   the PANGAEA Data Publisher for Earth \& Environmental Science portal
   (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.880512). A brief assessment of
   the data are presented to provide guidance for future users.
   Regional climate projections are generated at high (12 km) and
   intermediate (60 km) resolution using the Weather Research and
   Forecasting Model (WRF). The simulations cover the validation period
   1980-2010 and the two future periods 2020-2050 and 2070-2100. A brief
   comparison to observations and two climate change scenarios from the
   Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) initiative is
   presented to provide guidance on the data set to future users and to
   assess their climate change signal. Under the RCP4.5 (Representative
   Concentration Pathway 4.5) scenario, the results suggest an increase in
   temperature by 1.5 degrees C at the coast of Guinea and by up to 3
   degrees C in the northern Sahel by the end of the 21st century, in line
   with existing climate projections for the region. They also project an
   increase in precipitation by up to 300 mm per year along the coast of
   Guinea, by up to 150 mm per year in the Soudano region adjacent in the
   north and almost no change in precipitation in the Sahel. This stands in
   contrast to existing regional climate projections, which predict
   increasingly drier conditions.
   The high spatial and temporal resolution of the data, the extensive list
   of output variables, the large computational domain and the long time
   periods covered make this data set a unique resource for follow-up
   analyses and impact modelling studies over the greater West African
   region. The comprehensive documentation and standardisation of the data
   facilitate and encourage their use within and outside of the WASCAL
   community.},

Abstract = {Indigenous peoples of the North are affected by climate change, and
   future changes in climate are likely to continue to pose serious
   challenges. Climate change and the resulting change in the environment
   and communities are believed to further compound existing health issues.
   There is considerable regional variation within the circumpolar world,
   and each area of the Canadian Arctic has its own unique environmental
   and societal characteristics. Therefore, to track the impacts on human
   health in Nunavut, a monitoring framework-one that takes into account
   the territory's unique context-must be implemented. The objective of
   this study was to identify human health indicators of climate change on
   a global scale with a focus on indicators relevant to the Canadian
   Arctic atmosphere, habitats, and peoples. The Piliriqatigiinniq
   Community Health Research Model provided the guiding framework for this
   exploratory study. First, a scoping review of health-related indicators
   of climate change was conducted. From this review, an initial list of 30
   indicators was produced. Second, individuals from multiple sectors were
   invited to participate in a consensus-building process to identify
   health-related indicators of climate change for Nunavut. Through
   individual selection and group discussion, a final set of 20 indicators
   was chosen by workshop participants. The indicators identified in both
   phases focused on four key themes: 1) environmental health; 2) morbidity
   and mortality; 3) population vulnerability; and 4) mitigation,
   adaptation, and policy. Participants felt these indicators would be
   useful in practice in Nunavut. Next steps are to implement and monitor
   the utility of the selected indicators.},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change and unsustainable land use practices in
   the Zanzibar Islands along the coast of Tanzania are threatening rural
   community livelihoods. Sustainably managing existing forests and
   reforesting degraded areas are adaptation strategies to improve their
   livelihoods. Communities are depending on the success of these
   conservation and reforestation efforts. To improve the reliability,
   transparency, and accountability of these efforts, we are implementing
   drone imagery, photogrammetry, and image processing algorithms to
   quickly identify strenuous areas of planted forests. This will be done
   by implementing two functionalities, crop health detection and crop
   detection, into a solution that can be used on any drone images of a
   given canopy. These solutions will be used by a non-profit
   non-governmental organization, Community Forests Pemba, to help aid

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {The morphological change of a headland bay beach-Tenby, WestWales,
   UK-was analysed over a 73-year period (1941-2014). Geo-referenced aerial
   photographs were used to extract shoreline positions which were
   subsequently compared with wave models based on storm event data. From
   the 1941 baseline, results showed shoreline change rates reduced over
   time with regression models enabling a prediction of shoreline
   equilibrium circa 2061. Further temporal analyses showed southern and
   central sector erosion and northern accretion, while models identified
   long-term plan-form rotation, i.e., a negative phase relationship
   between beach extremities and a change from negative to positive
   correlation within the more stable central sector. Models were then used
   in conjunction with an empirical 2nd order polynomial equation to
   predict the 2061 longshore equilibrium shoreline position under current
   environmental conditions. Results agreed with previous regional research
   which showed that dominant south and southwesterly wave regimes
   influence south to north longshore drift with counter drift generated by
   less dominant easterly regimes. The equilibrium shoreline was also used
   to underpin flood and inundation assessments, identifying areas at risk
   and strategies to increase resilience. UK shoreline management plans
   evaluate coastal vulnerability based upon temporal epochs of 20, 50 and
   100 years. Therefore, this research evaluating datasets spanning 73
   years has demonstrated the effectiveness of linear regression in
   integrating temporal and spatial consequences of sea level rise and
   storms. The developed models can be used to predict future shoreline
   positions aligned with shoreline management plan epochs and inform
   embayed beach shoreline assessments at local, regional and international
   scales, by identifying locations of vulnerability and enabling the
   development of management strategies to improve resilience under
   scenarios of sea level rise and climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper identifies and analyses climate change impacts, their
   cascading consequences and the livelihood implications of these impacts
   on smallholder agricultural communities of coastal Bangladesh. Six
   physically and socio-economically vulnerable communities of
   south-western coastal regions were studied. Primary data was collected
   through focus group discussions, a seasonal calendar, and historical
   transect analysis. Three orders of impacts of climate change on
   smallholder farmers are identified and described. The first order
   impacts involve increasing erosion of the capacity of local communities
   to mitigate vulnerability to climate change impacts. This situation led
   to the second order impacts, which significantly transformed the
   agricultural landscape and production patterns. The cumulative effects
   of the first and second order impacts sparked the third order impacts in
   the form of worsening community livelihood assets and conditions. The
   findings of this paper can contribute to the formulation of sustainable
   adaptation policies and programs to manage the vulnerability of local
   communities to climate change impacts in the country effectively.},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {171-180},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Fiji is expected to come under increasing pressure and risk from various
   threats resulting from climate change and sea-level rise (SLR). Fiji
   consists of 332 islands and thus has a predominant and large coastline.
   Viti Levu is the largest and most important of the islands, harboring
   Fiji's capital city and most of the major towns concentrated around its
   coast. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the extent of
   possible sea-level rise using GIS, and to identify high-risk locations.
   Potential sea level rise was shown graphically as an output to determine
   where inundation or flooding would take place. This analysis allowed
   important areas facing risk to be highlighted for future action.
   Flooding/inundation can be classified into two kinds: `permanent
   inundation', which is the result of sea-level rise with tide; and
   `temporary flooding', also including occasional storm surge events. The
   inundated area was displayed under different projections and quantified.
   The results produced output maps showing the distribution of
   inundation/flooding around the island of Viti Levu as well as the extent
   of flooding. Six scenarios for sea-level rise were used (0.09, 0.18,
   0.48, 0.50, 0.59, 0.88 m). Six scenarios for storm surge were used with
   return intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 years. High risk and priority
   locations are identified as Fiji's capital Suva, the major tourist
   center and arrival port of Nadi, and Fiji's second city Lautoka. Future
   action, adaptation and response strategies in these identified locations
   must occur to reduce risk from climate change.},

Abstract = {On the Pacific Coast of northern California in the United States, coho
   salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (O. mykiss) are
   protected fish species, and habitat requirements must be considered in
   analysis and design of flood mitigation projects. Development of viable
   flood mitigation strategies requires detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
   analyses to evaluate processes that control flooding and ecosystem
   conditions. Morphodynamics of the stream channel and floodplain are
   governed largely by sediment transport and deposition, hence these
   processes must also be analysed. We present analyses of flooding and
   geomorphology, including consideration of fish habitat constraints, for
   developing flood mitigation conceptual designs in two field areas.
   Easkoot Creek flooding affects the community of Stinson Beach located
   near sea level on the coast 25 km north of San Francisco. Green Valley
   Creek flooding affects a principal road and vineyards near the community
   of Graton about 95 km north of San Francisco in the Russian River
   watershed. Watershed-scale hydrologic models and twodimensional
   hydraulic models (MIKE FLOOD) supported by LiDAR-derived topographic
   data and field surveys were used to estimate flows and flood extent
   during design storms for existing conditions and for alternative
   potential flood mitigation measures. Bed load sediment transport was

Title = {Interacting implications of climate change, population dynamics, and
   urban heat mitigation for future exposure to heat extremes},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {One near-term expression of climate change is increased occurrence and
   intensity of extreme heat events. The evolution of extreme heat risk in
   cities depends on the interactions of large-scale climate change with
   regional dynamics and urban micro-climates as well as the distribution
   and demographic characteristics of people who live and work within these
   micro-climate areas. Here we use California as a testbed where we employ
   a suite of high-resolution (1.5 km) future regional climate simulations
   coupled with a satellite-driven urban canopy model and a spatially
   explicit population projection to investigate the interacting effects of
   climate change, population growth, and urban heat mitigation measures,
   such as cool roofs, on exposure to extreme heat events. We find that
   climate change and population growth reinforce with one another to drive
   substantial increases in future exposure to heat extremes, which are
   poised to become more frequent, longer, and more intense. Exposure to
   events analogous to historic high-mortality extreme heat waves increases
   by 3.5-6 folds. Widespread implementation of cool roofs can offset a
   substantial fraction (51\%-100\%) of the increased heat exposure and
   associated building energy demand owing to climate change in urbanized
   regions.},

Title = {Learning from risk reduction pilot projects for enhancing long-term
   adaptation governance: The case of Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {93-103},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In Mauritius island in the Indian Ocean, as in most low-lying coastal
   areas and Small Island Developing States in particular, coastal risks
   affect community livelihood, economic prosperity and the degradation of
   natural ecosystems. Risks of coastal erosion and marine flooding result
   both from climate-related ocean changes and anthropogenic drivers such
   as inappropriate coastal development and structural protection measures.
   Poor development planning and lack of coordination between public and
   private actors have increased the exposure of human assets along the
   Mauritius coastline. To reduce these risks, the government leads risk
   reduction activities in coastal zones, functioning on a centralized
   top-down governance approach. In recent years, this governance framework
   has been evolving by opening up participatory channels and exploring a
   long-term adaptation perspective. Progress is driven by international
   engagements and demonstration projects to embrace soft measures,
   nature-based options and integrated solutions. We review a selection of
   pilot projects undertaken by the government that illustrate flexibility
   in a `learning by doing' model. However, we find that certain governance
   arrangements do not allow to draw the most from ad hoc projects because
   they do not feed into a long-term comprehensive plan. We consider the
   role of evidence and risk assessments, learning processes and
   coordination mechanisms as key governance mechanisms required for a
   robust and evolving national coastal risk reduction and adaptation
   policy framework.},

Volume = {111},

Abstract = {Understanding public perceptions of climate is critical for developing
   an effective strategy to mitigate the effects of human activity on the
   natural environment and reduce human vulnerability to the impacts of
   climate change. While recent climate assessments document change among
   various physical systems (e. g., increased temperature, sea level rise,
   shrinking glaciers), environmental perceptions are relatively
   under-researched despite the fact that there is growing skepticism and
   disconnect between climate science and public opinion. This study
   utilizes a socio-ecological research framework to investigate how public
   perceptions compared with environmental conditions in one urban center.
   Specifically, air temperature during an extreme heat event was examined
   as one characteristic of environmental conditions by relating
   simulations from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) atmospheric
   model with self-reported perceptions of regional and neighborhood
   temperatures from a social survey of Phoenix, AZ (USA) metropolitan area
   residents. Results indicate that: 1) human exposure to high temperatures
   varies substantially throughout metropolitan Phoenix; 2) public
   perceptions of temperature are more strongly correlated with proximate
   environmental conditions than with distal conditions; and 3) perceptions
   of temperature are related to social characteristics and situational
   variables. The social constructionist paradigm explains public
   perceptions at the regional scale, while experience governs attitude
   formation at the neighborhood scale.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {This paper considers the needed adaptation and mitigation agenda for
   cities in India - where the urban population is likely to grow by around
   500 million over the next 50 years. It considers the likely changes that
   climate change will bring in temperature, precipitation and extreme
   rainfall, drought, river and inland flooding, storms/storm
   surges/coastal flooding, sea-level rise and environmental health risks,
   and who within urban populations are most at risk. It notes the
   importance for urban areas of an effective rural adaptation agenda
   especially in maintaining the productivity and functioning of rural
   systems. It highlights the importance of today's infrastructure
   investments, taking into account climate changes, given the long
   lifespan of most infrastructure, and the importance of urban management
   engaging with changing risk profiles. One important part of this is the
   need to connect official adaptation initiatives to the much-improved
   natural hazard risk assessment, management and mitigation capacity that
   responded to major disasters. The paper ends by describing a possible
   urban climate change adaptation framework, including changes needed at
   the national, state, city and neighbourhood levels, and linkages to
   mitigation.},

Title = {Climate Change Induced Coastline Change Adjacent to Small Tidal Inlets},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The many thousands of small tidal inlets (STIs), and their adjacent
   coastlines, are almost certain to be affected by climate change in
   multiple ways, due to their behaviour being closely linked to both
   oceanic and terrestrial drivers such as riverflow, sea level, and ocean
   waves, all which are projected to change over the 21(st) century.
   Development of risk informed adaptation strategies for these highly
   utilized and inhabited inlet-interrupted coast zones requires
   projections of both alongshore average coastline recession and
   alongshore variability in coastline position along the coast under
   future forcing conditions, the latter being an aspect that has not
   received much attention to date. Here, a combination of a process-based
   morphodynamic model (Delft3D) and the reduced complexity coastline model
   (SMIC), concurrently forced with tides, waves, riverflows, and sea level
   rise, is used to investigate both of these phenomena at STI-interrupted
   coasts. The models are here applied to schematised conditions
   representing two systems in Sri Lanka, representing two of the three
   main Types of STIs: Negombo lagoon - permanently open, locationally
   stable inlet (Type 1), and Kalutara lagoon - permanently open,
   alongshore migrating inlet (Type 2). Results indicate that, under a high
   emissions climate scenario following RCP 8.5, by end-century, the
   coastline adjacent to the Type 1 STI may experience an alongshore
   average recession as large as 200 m, and that the alongshore variability
   in coastline position may be up to twice that at present. The Type 2 STI
   is projected to experience an alongshore average coastline recession of
   about 120 m, and up to a 75\% increase in alongshore variability in
   coastline position by end-century, relative to the present. Thus, both
   the alongshore average coastline recession and the increase in the
   alongshore variability in coastline position are greater at the Type 1
   STI, compared to at the Type 2 STI. These findings highlight the
   importance of accounting for both alongshore average coastline recession
   and future changes in alongshore variability in coastline position when
   assessing coastal hazards and risk on inlet-interrupted coasts to
   adequately inform climate adaptation strategies.},

   Strategies},
Journal = {TOXICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) was deployed to
   investigate the temporal variability of non-refractory particulate
   matter (NR-PM1) in the coastal city of Galway, Ireland, from February to
   July 2016. Source apportionment of the organic aerosol (OA) was
   performed using the newly developed rolling PMF strategy and was
   compared with the conventional seasonal PMF. Primary OA (POA) factors
   apportioned by rolling and seasonal PMF were similar. POA factors of
   hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), peat, wood, and coal were associated with
   domestic heating, and with an increased contribution to the OA mass in
   winter. Even in summer, sporadic heating events occurred with similar
   diurnal patterns to that in winter. Two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors were
   resolved, including more-oxygenated OOA and less-oxygenated OOA (i.e.,
   MO-OOA and LO-OOA, accordingly) which were found to be the dominant OA
   factors during summer. On average, MO-OOA accounted for 62\% of OA and
   was associated with long-range transport in summer. In summer, compared
   to rolling PMF, the conventional seasonal PMF over-estimated LO-OOA by
   nearly 100\% while it underestimated MO-OOA by 30\%. The results from
   this study show residential heating and long-range transport alternately
   dominate the submicron aerosol concentrations in this coastal city,
   requiring different mitigation strategies in different seasons.},

Title = {Sea breeze effect mapping for mitigating summer urban warming: For
   making urban environmental climatemap of Yokohama and its surrounding
   area},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {529-550},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Temperatures in urban area rise; therefore, it is necessary to consider
   the mitigation of urban warming. Considering that, in coastal areas such
   as Yokohama, an effective mitigation could be based on sea breeze
   patterns during summer daytime, this study aims at analyzing the
   relationship between temperature distributions and sea breeze fronts.
   Eventually, the target of this paper could be the creation of an Urban
   Environmental Climate Map (UECM) showing mitigation measures for each
   zone. Firstly, fine weather days are extracted and the sea breeze
   blowing patterns are classified in the target area. Secondly, the wind
   and temperature distribution patterns are mapped using WRF. The results
   obtained enable the mapping of the sea breeze fronts and the analysis of
   the relationship between temperature distributions and sea breeze
   fronts. Finally, a spatial zoning is performed. The results are
   presented as follows: 1) Sea breeze blowing patterns are classified into
   three patterns; 2) Based on the numerical simulation results and the
   temperature data observed in coastal areas, southwest wind has a cooling
   effect; 3) The target area is classified into ``Sea breeze arrival
   zone{''} and others based on the presence of a see breeze; 4) An UECM
   showing proper mitigation measures is proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Adaptation to flood risks in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-73},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to present part of the research results in
   developing an adaptation process to cope with flood risk in coastal
   cities under the impact of climate change variability and rapid
   urbanization in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two main assessment tools applied in this
   research are rapid vulnerability assessment and tool for environmental
   assessment and management.
   Findings - Under the same natural conditions, people living in more
   urbanized districts suffer with more inundation and risks from polluted
   floodwater than those who live in less urbanized districts.
   Notwithstanding, people in lower urbanized districts are more vulnerable
   since they have a low capacity to cope with flood and pollution due to
   flood-prone living conditions, poverty and lack of awareness on the
   changing variability and water pollution. Gender analysis in this
   research has found that men and women play different roles in coping
   with hazards, and women suffer with more risks than men especially in
   term of health, sexual harassment, and increasing responsibility.
   Practical implications - The adaptation process should focus on
   integrating vulnerability assessment findings appropriately with the
   assessment tools and gender analysis in order to develop as well as
   implement adaptation measures effectively and efficiently. This
   adaptation process should also be applied for other countries having
   different contexts of development under different levels of projected
   climate change-related risks.
   Originality/value - This research contributes in developing the process
   on adaptation to possible hazards related to climate change, especially
   for coastal communities of Vietnam and developing countries where the
   urbanization process is increasing rapidly.},

Title = {``We can't do it on our own!{''} - Integrating stakeholder and
   scientific knowledge of future flood risk to inform climate change
   adaptation planning in a coastal region},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {50-57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Decision-makers face a particular challenge in planning for climate
   adaptation. The complexity of climate change's likely impacts, such as
   increased flooding, has widened the scope of information necessary to
   take action. This is particularly the case in valuable low-lying coastal
   regions, which host many competing interests, and where there is a
   growing need to draw from varied fields in the risk-based management of
   flooding. The rising scrutiny over science's ability to match
   expectations of policy actors has called for the integration of
   stakeholder and scientific knowledge domains. Focusing on the Broads -
   the United Kingdom's largest protected wetland - this study looked to
   assess future flood risk and consider potential adaptation responses in
   a collaborative approach. Interviews and surveys with local stakeholders
   accompanied the development of a hydraulic model in an iterative
   participatory design, centred on a scientist-stakeholder workshop.
   Knowledge and perspectives were shared on processes driving risk in the
   Broads, as well as on the implications of adaptation measures, allowing
   for their prioritisation. The research outcomes highlight not only the
   challenges that scientist-stakeholder integrated assessments of future
   flood risk face, but also their potential to lead to the production of
   useful information for decision-making.},

Abstract = {In semi-arid environments, aperiodic rainfall pulses determine plant
   production and resource availability for higher trophic levels, creating
   strong bottom-up regulation. The influence of climatic factors on
   population vital rates often shapes the dynamics of small mammal
   populations in such resource-restricted environments. Using a 21-year
   biannual capture-recapture dataset (1993 to 2014), we examined the
   impacts of climatic factors on the population dynamics of the brush
   mouse (Peromyscus boylii) in semi-arid oak woodland of coastal-central
   California. We applied Pradel's temporal symmetry model to estimate
   capture probability (p), apparent survival (phi), recruitment (f), and
   realized population growth rate (lambda) of the brush mouse and examined
   the effects of temperature, rainfall, and El Nino on these demographic
   parameters. The population was stable during the study period with a
   monthly realized population growth rate of 0.993 +/- SE 0.032, but
   growth varied over time from 0.680 +/- 0.054 to 1.450 +/- 0.083. Monthly
   survival estimates averaged 0.789 +/- 0.005 and monthly recruitment
   estimates averaged 0.175 +/- 0.038. Survival probability and realized
   population growth rate were positively correlated with rainfall and
   negatively correlated with temperature. In contrast, recruitment was
   negatively correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with
   temperature. Brush mice maintained their population through multiple
   coping strategies, with high recruitment during warmer and drier periods
   and higher survival during cooler and wetter conditions. Although
   climatic change in coastal-central California will likely favor
   recruitment over survival, varying strategies may serve as a mechanism
   by which brush mice maintain resilience in the face of climate change.
   Our results indicate that rainfall and temperature are both important
   drivers of brush mouse population dynamics and will play a significant
   role in predicting the future viability of brush mice under a changing
   climate.},

Abstract = {The Marine Management Plan for the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage
   Site, Japan, provides a case study for adaptive marine ecosystem
   management and co-management of coastal fisheries. Shiretoko was the
   third World Natural Heritage Site registered in Japan and earned this
   title because of its (i) formation of seasonal sea ice at some of the
   lowest latitudes in the world, (ii) high biodiversity, and (iii) many
   globally threatened species. The natural resource management plan of the
   Shiretoko site is characterized by transparency and consensus building,
   because (i) UNESCO and IUCN require that the plan be sustainable and
   (ii) the Government of Japan has guaranteed local fisheries that there
   will be no additional regulations included in the plan. The Marine
   Management Plan describes which species and factors are monitored, how
   these data are evaluated, and how the benchmarks specified by ecosystem
   management are determined. The plan will provide a valuable example for
   the establishment of ``environment-friendly fisheries{''} in Japan and
   other countries, because it includes voluntary activities by resource
   users that are suitable for use in a local context, flexible to
   ecological/social fluctuations, and efficiently implemented through
   increased legitimacy and compliance. This approach is appropriate for
   coastal communities where a large number of small-scale fishers catch a
   variety of species using various types of gear. We develop a method to
   evaluate fisheries integrity by-catch and yield data. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {This study presents the reversal nature in rainfall over heavy rainfall
   zone (HRZ; more than 80\% of the long period average (LPA) of the Indian
   summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR)) and low rainfall zone (LRZ; less than
   40\% of ISMR-LPA) in India. The India Meteorological Department (IMD)
   high-resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) dataset is used from 1901
   to 2016. The single and multiple change-point detection techniques are
   used to find the change in rainfall patterns over both regions. Further,
   the study period is divided into two halves P1 (1901-1958) and P2
   (1959-2016) to examine the change in rainfall patterns in the recent and
   past periods. In P2, the rainfall pattern gets reversed, and ISMR has
   shown a significant increasing (decreasing) trend over the LRZ (HRZ).
   The increasing/decreasing number of moderate- and high-intensity
   rainfall events is one of the causes for this reversal pattern.
   Additionally, the number of dry days is increased over the HRZ and
   decreased over the LRZ. This study further confirms that the ``dry
   becomes drier and wet becomes wetter{''} paradigm is not solely
   acceptable for India. The present study provides information about
   changes in dry days and ISMR variability in the context of climate
   change, which will be useful to agricultural risk management, water
   resources, drought monitoring, model developers, and policy planner on
   the adaptation strategies for climate change.},

Title = {Diagnosing Transient Response to CO2 Forcing in Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean
   Model Experiments Using a Climate Model Emulator},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {A climate model emulator that mimics an ensemble of state-of-the-art
   coupled climate models has been used for probabilistic climate
   projections. To emulate and compare the latest and previous multimodel
   ensembles, this study establishes a new method to diagnose a set of
   parameters of effective radiative forcing, feedback, and impulse
   response functions by fitting a minimal emulator to time series of
   individual models in response to step- and ramp-shaped CO2 forcing up to
   a quadrupling concentration level. The diagnosed CO2 forcing is scaled
   down to a doubling level, leading to an unbiased estimate of equilibrium
   climate sensitivity. The average climate sensitivity of the latest
   ensemble is 18\% and 13\% greater than that of the previous ensemble for
   equilibrium and transient states. Although these increases are subject
   to data availability, the latter smaller rate is significant and is
   consistent with the relationship between feedback strength and response
   timescales.
   Plain Language Summary Pathways of climate change mitigation are based
   on probabilistic warming projections by a simple emulator that mimics an
   ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models. To gain insights into the
   latest multimodel ensemble, this study establishes a new method to
   analyze a set of key parameters to emulate individual models in terms of
   the global temperature and energy balance in response to changes in the
   atmospheric CO2 concentration. This method properly estimates the level
   of CO2 forcing, proportional to global warming, whereas a commonly used
   conventional method overestimates forcing levels for most mitigation
   pathways. On average, a common warming measure to a doubled CO2
   concentration in the latest multimodel ensemble is 18\% and 13\% greater
   than that in the previous ensemble for a final and transient responses,
   respectively. The latter smaller change can be explained from a
   fundamental characteristic in a simplified forcing-response framework.
   Although the differences between the two ensembles are subject to data
   availability, the difference between the final and transient responses
   is significant and has implications for mitigation pathways during this
   century.},

Abstract = {Climate resilience is an important mix of climate mitigation and climate
   adaptation designed to minimize current and future disruption while
   promoting opportunity. Given the importance of the regional and local
   arena for consideration of impacts of climate change trends and needs
   for climate action, climate resilience in one community, Duluth,
   Minnesota, is considered. At the core of this project is the climate
   resilience question: what can we currently be doing in our communities
   to prepare for projected climate change while simultaneously improving
   life for current residents and visitors? Given the growing importance of
   outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism in Duluth, the role this
   sector may be able to play in climate resilience is considered. Using
   action research methodology, the research process of adjusting,
   presenting, and conducting follow-up from a National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration Climate Adaptation for Coastal Communities
   workshop is presented. The study takes a unique look at one workshop
   outcome, a Duluth Parks and Recreation planning tool. Specifically, a
   resilience checklist is presented as a useful sample outcome of the
   overall process. Beyond the study community, the role of outdoor
   recreation to serve climate resilience is explored and affirmed.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The city of Turku is located in southwest Finland, in Northern Europe.
   Founded in 1229, it is the country's oldest city. It is situated around
   the Aura River, which flows into the Baltic Sea, making it an ideal
   location for its 184,000 inhabitants and 20,000 enterprises. In June
   2018, the city unveiled an ambitious climate plan to be carbon neutral
   by 2029. This plan was prepared according to the common model of the
   European Union (EU) (SECAP, Sustainable energy and climate action plan)
   with key milestones for years 2021, 2025, and 2029. It focuses on both
   adaptation and mitigation strategies with six measures outlined as
   necessary to meet the targets, two of which directly target citizen
   outreach and engagement. These two measures focus on mobilizing
   communities as partners in the climate plan and on raising awareness of
   climate change. Given its significance to the plan, this paper examines
   stakeholder engagement in the City of Turku's climate policies from a
   governance perspective. It asks the question, how does stakeholder
   participation materialize in the City of Turku's carbon neutral planning
   process? It aims to give a snapshot of baseline stakeholder
   participation in the city's carbon neutral aspirations. It has found
   that whilst the plan contains ambitions for stakeholder participation,
   it is not fully implemented. It recommends a citizen facilitated public
   participation steering group that aims to inspire citizens towards
   taking action and engaging in the decision-making process for a carbon
   neutral 2029.},

Title = {Social Resilience and Commercial Fishers' Responses to Management
   Changes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Understanding how social resilience influences resource users' responses
   to policy change is important for ensuring the sustainability of
   social-ecological systems and resource-dependent communities. We use the
   conceptualization and operationalization of social resilience proposed
   by Marshall and Marshall (2007) to investigate how resilience level
   influenced commercial fishers' perceptions about and adaptation to the
   2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We conducted
   face-to-face interviews with 114 commercial and charter fishers to
   measure their social resilience level and their responses and adaptation
   strategies to the 2004 zoning plan. Fishers with higher resilience were
   more likely to believe that the zoning plan was necessary, more likely
   to be supportive of the plan, and more likely to have adapted their
   fishing business and fishing activity to the plan than were fishers with
   lower social resilience. High-resilience fishers were also less likely
   to perceive negative impacts of the plan on their fishing business, less
   likely to have negative attitudes toward the consultation process used
   to develop and implement the plan, and less likely to have applied for
   financial compensation under the structural adjustment program. Results
   confirm the utility of the social resilience construct for identifying
   fishers who are likely to be vulnerable to changes, and those who are
   struggling to cope with change events. We conclude that managing for
   social resilience in the GBR would aid in the design and implementation
   of policies that minimize the impacts on resource users and lead to more
   inclusive and sustainable management, but that further research is
   necessary to better understand social resilience, how it can be fostered
   and sustained, and how it can be effectively incorporated into
   management.},

Abstract = {The preceding chapters have laid out the range of challenges of coastal
   simulation to support future coastal management, with a particular focus
   on understanding erosion, flood and habitat changes and their links to
   coastal management. The detailed case study in Norfolk places the theory
   and generic principles in a real-world management context that is
   particularly relevant to the UK, while international case studies (Chap.
   13) have introduced a range of alternative challenges and perspectives.
   The Tyndall Centre's coastal programme has highlighted how the
   management of the coastline needs to reflect the connectivity between
   the various geomorphological features, natural processes, engineered
   structures and socio-economic drivers. Moreover, it is crucial to
   understand the trade-offs that result from different management
   strategies. In the Norfolk case, the analysis strengthens the argument
   for a change in the widespread historic management approach of ``hold
   the line{''} towards allowing as much of the coastline as possible to
   return to a more natural and dynamic configuration. However, this is
   challenging for coastal governance, raising questions about how to
   address the concerns of directly and indirectly affected landowners and
   householders on the eroding coast.
   Given the large uncertainties in projections of future sea-level rise
   and other relevant climate factors, and the extent to which this
   influences the effectiveness of different management strategies, an
   adaptive (or learning) strategy that is regularly reviewed in the light
   of new information and an evolving governance/society context is most
   appropriate. To this end, the Tyndall Coastal Simulator approach of
   coupling visualisation tools with simulation models provides a powerful
   tool for analysing present and future trajectories of coastal evolution.
   This has been shown to motivate and engage policy makers and
   stakeholders in an on-going dialogue about the management choices ahead.
   This Chapter reviews the key contributions of the Tyndall Coastal
   Simulator in the context of UK coastal management, and how coastal
   management and policy formulation may be informed by the evidence and
   engagement philosophy it encapsulates. The overall approach is distilled
   for wider application and a set of key issues that are important to
   consider are identified. The notion of living with uncertainty and the
   need for adaptive management is a core issue. How the future tools and
   process of UK coastal management might evolve in the light of the
   Tyndall Coastal Simulator results is examined, including incremental and
   more radical developments.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-59},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Environmental change has stressed wildlife co-management systems in the
   Arctic because parameters are changing more rapidly than traditional
   scientific monitoring can accommodate. Co-management systems have also
   been criticized for not fully integrating harvesters into the local
   management of resources. These two problems can be approached through
   the use of spatially-defined human social units termed community
   clusters, which are based on the demographic or ecological units being
   managed. An examination of polar bear management in Nunavut Territory,
   Canada, shows that community clusters provide a forum to collect and
   analyse traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) over a geographic area
   that mirrors the management unit, providing detailed information of
   local conditions. This case study also provides examples of how
   instituting community clusters at a governance level provides harvesters
   with social space in which to develop their roles as managers, along the
   continuum from being powerless spectators to active, adaptive
   co-managers. Five steps for enhancing co-management systems through the
   inclusion of community clusters and their knowledge are: (1) the
   acceptance of TEK, science, the precautionary principle and the right of
   harvesters not to be constrained by overly-conservative management
   decisions; (2) data collection involving TEK and science, and a
   collaboration between the two; (3) institutionalization of community
   clusters for data collection; (4) institutionalization of community
   clusters in the management process; and (5) grass-roots initiatives to
   take advantage of the social space provided by the community cluster
   approach, in order to adapt the management to local conditions, and to

Abstract = {A study of substantial anthropogenic related pollution in the Coastal
   Samut Prakam Province (Thailand) was carried out focusing on the Bang Pu
   Nature Reserve (remnant mangrove wetland) using a remote sensing
   (geospatial) technique. Statistical regression models were developed
   between biochemical parameters of sample point and related reflectance
   data obtained from satellite imagery (Landsat TM). Change detection
   showed a significant increase in various water bodies over a period of a
   decade and significant increase in analyzed pollutant levels. The paper
   highlights the advantages of baseline data obtained and its significance
   towards a holistic approach to mitigating coastal pollution combining
   sustainable conservation and enhanced nature education through a
   significant ecosystem bio-diversification. Within the framework of the
   approach a buffering zone based on a constructed freshwater-fed wetland
   is to be introduced to serve as an effective pollution mitigating area
   serving the local community which is in serious need of such an
   environmental vehicle.},

Title = {Effects of climate change on key soil characteristics and strategy to
   enhance climate resilience of smallholder farming: an analysis of a
   pomegranate-field in a coastal Tunisian oasis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {79},

Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Climate change may affect soil fertility because it can alter various
   soil physicochemical characteristics through different mechanisms.
   Currently, a better understanding of its effect on soil physicochemical
   characteristics is required for sustainable soil management. Therefore,
   the main purposes of this study were to assess the effect of climate
   change on key soil physicochemical characteristics (i.e., soil moisture,
   organic carbon content, and macro-nutrients) and to develop a suitable
   soil management strategy to enhance climate resilience of smallholder
   farming in a Tunisian oasis, called Gabes Oasis. An investigation
   methodology was developed based on future climate projection and
   simulation of climate change effects on key soil physicochemical
   characteristics from 2019 to 2050 using the HP1 model. The HP1 model was
   calibrated and validated based on intensive field measurements over four
   years (from January 2015 to December 2018) in a pomegranate-field in
   Gabes Oasis. The results showed that the HP1 model could simulate soil
   physicochemical characteristics under the baseline scenario. Compared to
   the no climate change scenario, significant effects of climate change
   (i.e., RCP8.5, RCP6.0, and RCP4.5 scenarios) on the investigated key
   soil characteristics were predicted by 2050. Among the investigated soil
   characteristics, it was predicted that soil organic carbon content was
   most critically affected. By 2050, it is expected that this content will
   decrease by 14\% for RCP4.5 scenario, 16\% for RCP6.0 scenario, and 23\%
   for RCP8.5 scenario. Finally, it is recommended to apply the following
   cow manure amount to enhance soil characteristics resistance to future
   climate change: 3748 kg ha(-1) year(-1). However, more experiments on
   fields are necessary to investigate the sustainability of the proposed
   level of cow manure.},

Title = {The health benefits of greening strategies to cool urban environments-A
   heat health impact method},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {207},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Green infrastructure has the potential to cool urban environments and
   reduce the health burden due to heatwaves. This study develops a new
   method to quantify the benefits of urban heat mitigation technologies on
   human heat balance and population mortality. The Heat Health Impact
   (HHI) method is based on the state-ofthe-art, multi-parameter model,
   Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI).A proof-of-concept exercise
   applied the HHI method to Sydney, Australia (population = 5.7 million).
   All available weather stations (10) were selected for full spatial
   coverage of the Sydney region (12,367 km2), and average hourly UTCI was
   calculated from meteorological observations spanning the entire year
   2017. In the baseline analysis, average daily UTCI values were
   calculated for each of the 10 observation sites, and then spatially
   interpolated across the entire Sydney region for Feb 9, 2017, a
   representative heatwave day for Sydney. Three different greening
   intervention scenarios were investigated, and daily average change in
   UTCI (Delta UTCI) was calculated under each by comparison with the
   baseline scenario; this Delta UTCI was named Urban Cooling Effect (UCE).
   We implemented a health impact assessment methodology to estimate the
   change in attributable mortality due to each greening scenario for the
   Sydney GMR population for the representative heatwave day. Urban
   greening infrastructure scenarios reduced daily average UTCI between
   -0.2 and -1.7 degrees C on the heatwave day, with the health impact
   assessment indicating heat attributable deaths reducing up to 11.7 per
   day across the Sydney GMR compared to the baseline scenario. Our results
   highlight the health benefits of greening infrastructure to cool urban
   environments.},

   environment},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {133-145},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Australian government produces an independent report on the state of
   the Australian environment every five years. Based on 123 assessments of
   key pressures, key components of the marine environment, and the
   effectiveness of management responses to those pressures, the 2016
   assessment identified that the overall state of the Australian marine
   environment can be regarded as good. However, the historical impacts of
   a number of pressures (e.g. commercial and recreational fishing) and
   ongoing pressures caused by activities currently inadequately managed
   (e.g. climate change and marine debris) have, and are continuing to,
   deteriorate its state. As a result, the outlook for the marine
   environment can be regarded as mixed. Addressing the challenges facing
   the marine environment will require a coordinated, collaborative and
   dedicated effort across jurisdictions and sectors. A number of
   improvements to the assessment framework were implemented for the 2016
   report, the most substantial being the development of clear and
   repeatable processes for information synthesis and assessment. This
   improved transparency and supported the robustness of conclusions made.
   Improved communication of uncertainties associated with assessments, and
   comparability with assessments in previous reports has furthered the
   quality of the report and laid the foundation for improvements going
   forward. Processes that will continue to improve assessments include
   identifying key indicators that can be reliably and effectively
   monitored, improving data provision processes, enhancing assessment
   frameworks and reporting processes to ensure that approaches are
   integrated and support the delivery of tangible and practical risk
   mitigation and adaptation pathways.},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {62-69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The anthropogenic developments have been causing a warming phenomenon of
   city centres called urban heat islands (UHI). The effect is made worse
   by the urban canopy characteristics of concrete, facade glazing and
   asphalt surfaces of building and road structures. Buildings would absorb
   shortwave radiation and store heat during daytime, and release heat into
   atmosphere at night, thus increasing the ambient temperature. The wide
   spread use of HVAC air-conditioners in the densely urbanised areas, as
   well as increasing commercial developments and massive rise in
   automobile traffics are also important contributing factors, which can
   lead to formation of ozone and smog. Urban temperatures can be up to
   5-12? warmer than the surrounding countryside under extreme
   meteorological conditions of calm and clear anticyclonic weather. High
   temperatures in cities can exacerbate energy demand for building air
   conditioning, therefore higher emission of CO2 contributing further to
   green house warming. There are a number of UHI mitigation strategies
   including increasing the surface reflectivity and vegetation density in
   urban areas. This can be achieved by greening the urban environment by
   planting trees and vegetation; incorporating better roof designs such as
   cool roofs, greenroofs, reflective roofs and cool pavements. The purpose
   of this paper is to provide a review of UHI effects in city centres and
   examine the mitigation strategies and the thermal benefits of
   greenroofs.},

Abstract = {Sunshade geoengineering - the installation of reflective mirrors between
   the Earth and the Sun to reduce incoming solar radiation, has been
   proposed as a mitigative measure to counteract anthropogenic global
   warming. Although the popular conception is that geoengineering can
   re-establish a `natural' pre-industrial climate, such a scheme would
   itself inevitably lead to climate change, due to the different temporal
   and spatial forcing of increased CO(2) compared to reduced solar
   radiation. We investigate the magnitude and nature of this climate
   change for the first time within a fully coupled General Circulation
   Model. We find significant cooling of the tropics, warming of high
   latitudes and related sea ice reduction, a reduction in intensity of the
   hydrological cycle, reduced ENSO variability, and an increase in
   Atlantic overturning. However, the changes are small relative to those
   associated with an unmitigated rise in CO(2) emissions. Other problems
   such as ocean acidification remain unsolved by sunshade geoengineering.},

Title = {Salt Mitigation Strategies of Solar-Driven Interfacial Desalination},
Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {8},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Solar-driven interfacial desalination (SDID), which is based on
   localized heating and interfacial evaporation, provides an opportunity
   for developing environmentally friendly and cost-effective seawater
   thermal desalination. However, localized heating and rapidly generated
   interfacial steam may cause salt to accumulate on the evaporator's
   surface and block the channel of steam evaporation. Salt accumulation
   inevitably reduces the light absorption and service period of the solar
   absorber, resulting in a significant decrease in evaporation efficiency
   over time. Salt accumulation makes it difficult to produce SDID devices
   with high energy efficiency and long-term stability for large-scale use
   in remote poverty-stricken areas. Therefore, the exploration of novel
   and effective strategies for addressing salt accumulation through both
   material design and structural engineering has attracted more attention
   in recent years. This review presents an overview of the
   state-of-the-art advancements in salt-resistant photothermal evaporation
   and discusses the critical issues for achieving salt mitigation SDID,
   focusing on the classification of salt mitigation strategies based on
   photothermal evaporation configurations, the basic mechanism of salt
   mitigation, and the architectural design of photothermal materials.

Abstract = {Climate researchers use carbon dioxide emission scenarios to explore
   alternative climate futures and potential impacts, as well as
   implications of mitigation and adaptation policies. Often, these
   scenarios are published without formal probabilistic interpretations,
   given the deep uncertainty related to future development. However, users
   often seek such information, a likely range or relative probabilities.
   Without further specifications, users sometimes pick a small subset of
   emission scenarios and/or assume that all scenarios are equally likely.
   Here, we present probabilistic judgments of experts assessing the
   distribution of 2100 emissions under a business-as-usual and a policy
   scenario. We obtain the judgments through a method that relies only on
   pairwise comparisons of various ranges of emissions. There is wide
   variability between individual experts, but they clearly do not assign
   equal probabilities for the total range of future emissions. We contrast
   these judgments with the emission projection ranges derived from the
   shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and a recent multi-model
   comparison producing probabilistic emission scenarios. Differences on
   long-term emission probabilities between expert estimates and
   model-based calculations may result from various factors including model
   restrictions, a coverage of a wider set of factors by experts, but also
   group think and inability to appreciate long-term processes.},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts are functioning as risk multipliers to problems
   which are already apparent and affect cultural heritage sites. Sea Level
   Rise and increased storm events can damage structures that were not
   designed to withstand prolonged structural pressure, erosion, and
   immersion. Risks affecting coastal cultural heritage may stem from
   exposure to one or more hazards and it is important to facilitate a
   holistic understanding of factors driving them. Wave energy and
   overtopping of coastal structures represents a potential hazard for
   people, property and infrastructure. Especially when the coastal
   structure is a monument or landmark, mitigation measures and monitoring
   are needed. Depending on the level of acceptable risk and required
   degree of certainty related to wave overtopping, coastal engineers rely
   on predictions from semi-empirical desktop methods and numerical models
   for answers. Moreover, the anticipated increase in extreme events due to
   climatic change make protection and prevention action even more
   necessary. In this work the combination of risk assessment analysis
   related to increasing sea level and storm frequency, wave numerical
   modelling, breakwater design and economic sustainability is presented.
   As a case study, the Venetian Coastal walls of the city of Heraklion are
   considered. Numerical modelling results were generally found to be
   consistent with overtopping wave measurements. For the analysis of the
   wind regime in the near and far future, climatic modelling has been
   used. Climatic modelling results indicate that for the coastal area of
   Heraklion the wind speed and directions are expected to change in the
   near and far future, with an increase in wind speeds but also an
   increase in the frequency of the wind directions that effect the
   monuments the most. Based on the results of the measurements and
   numerical modelling, mitigation actions were proposed that include,
   increasing the submerged armouring of the Venetian City walls and the
   use of natural based solutions for low slope areas in order to reduce
   wave energy, run up and overtopping, reconstruction of the natural
   environment, so that the monument can be made accessible for longer
   periods of time.},

Abstract = {The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) principally due to the
   burning of fossil fuels is a key driver of anthropogenic climate change.
   Mitigation strategies include improved efficiency, using renewable
   energy, and capture and long-term sequestration of CO2. Most
   sequestration research considers CO2 injection into deep saline aquifers
   or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. Unconventional suggestions include
   CO2 storage in the porous volcanic lavas of uppermost oceanic crust.
   Here we test the feasibility of injecting CO2 into deep-sea basalts and
   identify sites where CO2 should be both physically and gravitationally
   trapped. We use global databases to estimate pressure and temperature,
   hence density of CO2 and seawater at the sediment-basement interface. At
   previously suggested sites on the Juan de Fuca Plate and in the eastern
   equatorial Pacific Ocean, CO2 is gravitationally unstable. However, we
   identify five sediment-covered regions where CO2 is denser than
   seawater, each sufficient for several centuries of anthropogenic CO2
   emissions.},

Title = {The effect of an urban park on the microclimate in its vicinity: a case
   study for Antwerp, Belgium},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {E303-E322},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {An urban park can exhibit a cooling effect not only in the park itself,
   but also in its wake with respect to the prevailing wind. This study
   investigates the cooling potential of an urban park in Antwerp, Belgium
   focusing on two parameters: (1) intensity of the cooling effect,
   indicating the maximum reduction in air temperature and (2) range of the
   cooling effect, indicating the maximum horizontal distance where a
   minimum of 0.1 degrees C cooling effect is present. Computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed using the three-dimensional
   unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Coupled simulations
   of wind flow and heat transfer consider all the conductive, convective
   and radiative heat transfer processes but not the long-wave radiation
   heat exchange between buildings, trees and ground. The vegetation model
   used in this study is evaluated with experimental data from an earlier
   study. Moreover, the simulated air temperatures inside the Antwerp city
   center are compared with available measurement data. Following the
   fairly-good predictions from CFD simulations, results from the following
   cases are compared: (1) base case with the park, (2) a case with an open
   square instead of the park, and (3) a case with representative buildings
   instead of the park. The results indicate a maximum daytime intensity
   and range of the cooling effect of 3.4 degrees C and 498m at 1500LST
   (UTC + 2, Central European Summer Time). Further analysis shows that the
   cooling effect is more profound closer to the ground. Apart from the
   daytime cooling effect, the park investigated has the potential to lower
   wind velocities, resulting in increased air temperatures during the
   night-time (at 0000LST) by 0.9 degrees C, although this number might be
   slightly different given the neglect of long-wave radiation heat
   exchange between buildings, trees and ground.},

Title = {21st Century reform in Australian coastal policy and legislation},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {27-32},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent coastal legislative and policy reform in Australia reflects the
   changing focus of coastal management studies in the international
   scientific literature indicating a move towards systems perspectives,
   cross-boundary management strategies and an integration of marine and
   terrestrial environments. Significant global and national reports on
   integrated coastal management and climate change set the stage for a
   21st Century wave of coastal reform in Australia. Given the absence of
   Australian national coastal legislation or coastal policy the reforms
   were initiated by a number of state governments such as in New South
   Wales and Victoria where new pieces of state-based coastal legislation
   came into law in 2018. This paper examines new coastal legislation,
   policies, manuals, and government documents and the rationale and
   triggers behind these reforms. These are discussed in the context of
   Australian governance structures and the international coastal
   management literature. The paper concludes that the latest wave of
   coastal reform in Australia represents a non-uniform stateled push for a
   more integrated approach to coastal management including, adaptation to
   climate change, sustainable development, a systems-based approach to
   coastal processes and inclusion of both marine and terrestrial
   environments.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation frameworks: an evaluation of plans for coastal
   Suffolk, UK},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2511-2524},
Abstract = {This paper asserts that three principal frameworks for climate change
   adaptation can be recognised in the literature: scenarioled (SL),
   vulnerability-led (VL) and decision-centric (DC) frameworks. A criterion
   is developed to differentiate these frameworks in recent adaptation
   projects. The criterion features six key hallmarks as follows: (1) use
   of climate model information; (2) analysis of metrics/units; (3)
   socio-economic knowledge; (4) stakeholder engagement; (5) adaptation of
   implementation mechanisms; (6) tier of adaptation implementation. The
   paper then tests the validity of this approach using adaptation projects
   on the Suffolk coast, UK. Fourteen adaptation plans were identified in
   an online survey. They were analysed in relation to the hallmarks
   outlined above and assigned to an adaptation framework.
   The results show that while some adaptation plans are primarily SL, VL
   or DC, the majority are hybrid, showing a mixture of DC/VL and DC/SL
   characteristics. Interestingly, the SL/VL combination is not observed,
   perhaps because the DC framework is intermediate and attempts to
   overcome weaknesses of both SL and VL approaches. The majority (57 \%)
   of adaptation projects generated a risk assessment or advice notes.
   Further development of this type of framework analysis would allow
   better guidance on approaches for organisations when implementing
   climate change adaptation initiatives, and other similar proactive
   long-term planning.},

Title = {Future Meteorological Droughts in Ecuador: Decreasing Trends and
   Associated Spatio-Temporal Features Derived From CMIP5 Models},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Droughts are one of the most spatially extensive disasters that are
   faced by societies. Despite the urgency to define mitigation strategies,
   little research has been done regarding droughts related to climate
   change. The challenges are due to the complexity of droughts and to
   future precipitation uncertainty from Global Climate Models (GCMs). It
   is well-known that climate change will have more impact on developing
   countries. This is the case for Ecuador, which also has the additional
   challenges of lacking meteorological drought studies covering its three
   main regions: Coast, Highlands, and Amazon, and of having an intricate
   orography. Thus, this study assesses the spatio-temporal characteristics
   of present and future droughts in Ecuador under Representative
   Concentrations Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. The 10 km dynamically
   downscaled products (DGCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5
   (CMIP5) was used. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for
   droughts was calculated pixel-wise for present time 1981-2005 and for
   future time 2041-2070. The results showed a slightly decreasing trend
   for future droughts for the whole country, with a larger reduction for
   moderate droughts, followed by severe and extreme drought events. In the
   Coast and Highland regions, the intra-annual analysis showed a reduction
   of moderate and severe future droughts for RCP 4.5 and for RCP 8.5
   throughout the year. Extreme droughts showed small and statistically
   non-significant decreases. In the Amazon region, moderate droughts
   showed increases from May to October, and decreases for the rest of the
   year. Additionally, severe drought increases are expected from May to
   December, and decreases from January to April. Finally, extreme drought
   increases are expected from January to April, with larger increases in
   October and November. Thus, in the Amazon, the rainy period showed a
   decreasing trend of droughts, following the wetter in wet- and drier in
   dry paradigm. Climate change causes decision-making process and calls
   for adaptation strategies being more challenging. In this context, our
   study has contributed to better mapping the space-time evolution of
   future drought risk in Ecuador, thus providing valuable information for
   water management and decision making as Ecuador faces climate change.},

Abstract = {Productivity and the associated generation of biomass are two definitive
   aspects of Large Marine Ecosystems. Knowing the historic, prevailing
   conditions (the baseline) in terms of these two major indicators allows
   countries that are aiming to manage impacts and resource utilisation
   within the LMES to monitor them for change and to adapt their management
   regimes to such changes. The Agulhas and the Somali Current LMEs are
   western boundary currents that flow along the eastern coastline of
   Africa. Recent studies, supported by the Global Environment Facility and
   implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme, have assisted
   the countries within and bordering these LMEs to capture such baseline
   date and to develop a transboundary monitoring and associated management
   response mechanisms through a Strategic Action Programme for sustainable
   management of the western Indian Ocean Large Marine Ecosystems. This
   paper highlights some of the findings from the transboundary baseline
   assessment and discusses how these findings and subsequent monitoring of
   changes can be used to support adaptive management decisions by the
   countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a unified adaptive energy management scheme (EMS) is
   proposed for renewable-interfaced hybrid energy storage system (HESS)
   under grid connected/islanded conditions. A second harmonic based phased
   locked loop is employed for effective synchronization/resynchronization
   of the microgrid system under contingency conditions. The operation and
   management of the microgrid system under both these modes are
   accomplished by an efficient adaptive power management algorithm. A
   quantitative analysis on the HESS performance is provided in order to
   investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Load curtailment
   and off-maximum power point tracking features are also accommodated in
   the proposed scheme. This approach address seamless transfer between the
   various sub-modes of the system along with additional services such as
   power quality enhancement and effective power dispatch between various
   sources. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by both
   simulation and experimental investigations.},

Title = {Firms as drivers of integrative adaptive regional development in the
   context of environmental hazards in developing countries and emerging
   economies - A conceptual framework},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1522-1541},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many industrial sites in developing countries and emerging economies
   face increasing exposure to environmental hazards, e.g. in coastal
   locations, while being situated within the territory of state
   authorities which lack in capacity to provide adaptation solutions. It
   is therefore relevant to ask, whether and how firms engage in
   adaptation, both individually and collectively, in order to reduce
   business disruptions, enhance their competitiveness and shape regional
   development. However, the literature has made little efforts to address
   these questions conceptually and empirically. The paper therefore
   develops a heuristic conceptual framework for deciphering the
   decision-making of firms exposed to environmental hazards and the role
   that they might play for shaping larger risk governance and eventually
   regional adaptation. In doing so, the paper builds on both an
   explorative empirical study in Jakarta and Semarang and the assessment
   of different literatures of relevance to the topic. The proposed
   framework argues that firms potentially fulfill a twofold role in
   shaping integrative adaptive regional development when exposed to
   environmental hazards. First, firms seek to enhance their own
   competitiveness through adjustments which are determined by their
   routines, risk behavior and the institutional setting. Second, firms act
   as stakeholders within broader collective adaptation. In conclusion, the
   framework suggests that firms' (in-)actions can shift the trajectories
   of regional development into different directions, along a gradient from
   collapse, resistance, resilience to transformation. The framework can be
   used to guide empirical analysis and inspire policy making and practice
   of integrated adaptation governance, especially in rapidly changing
   developing countries and emerging economies.},

Abstract = {The coastal region of Bangladesh contributes to about one fifth of the
   country's landmass and one seventh of the total population. Once the
   region was diverse and rich in natural resources with huge forest
   vegetation, fishes, crops, poultry, livestock and wildlife, but at
   present, the whole region is at the verge of serious degradation due to
   human interventions and climate change. The study was carried out in
   Batiaghata upazila under Khulna district. Long term climatic data showed
   that there is an increasing trend of both maximum and minimum
   temperatures. On the other hand, although the annual rainfall has been
   increased in recent years but monthly distribution of rainfall is not
   even and it showed that the monsoon rainfall was increased by 56\%,
   while dry season rainfall decreased by 60\%. Changes in temperature and
   rainfall patterns are accelerating flood, salinity and drought hazards,
   which are depleting both resources and environments. Increasing trend of
   cyclonic storms as well as tidal surges would be more and more
   vulnerable to climatic extremities in the coastal region. Due to
   intrusion of saline water for brackish water shrimp farming and
   increasing prolong drought, soil and water salinity have been increased
   remarkably, which adversely affecting both floral and faunal resources
   in the region. Increased soil and water salinity hampered soil fertility
   status and it was observed that around 27.36\% soils organic matter has
   been depleted compared to base value of 1999. Suitable coping and
   adaptation measures should be taken immediately to restore the coastal
   ecosystem for sustaining agricultural production and development.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {This study explores the significant role of indigenous traditional
   ecological knowledge (ITEK) in weather forecast prediction and fishing
   related activities in the coastal villages of Tamil Nadu. In total, 33
   rural coastal villages were studied for different uses of ecological
   indicators in seasonal predictions based on oceanographic parameters,
   hydro-geological, astrophysical, meteorological and biological
   conditions. We focused on oral dialects from traditional fishing
   practitioners, local community leaders and fishers as efficient
   respondents to carry out the study. In addition, we also attempted to
   develop a template of seasonal ecological calendar based on ecological
   indicators of Tamil Nadu coastline. This conceptualisation can also be
   absorbed on a synoptic scale as an integration framework of ITEK and
   scientific innovations. On the other perspective, it is so factual that
   adaptation of ITEKs in the current decades is in verge of extinction due
   to several factors such as modernization, technological advancements and
   waning intergenerational knowledge transmissions. In the face of losing
   ITEKs, it is crucial to integrate ITEKs in the scientific seasonal
   forecasting of environmental changes and climatic events to facilitate
   better decision making policies on adaptation and mitigation strategies.
   It is highly essential to build the concept of conservation and
   documentation of ITEK to solve the climate crisis and effective decision
   making. In the recent years, the approach of integrating biophysical and
   social sciences on understanding earth science is an emerging concept to
   enhance climate knowledge. Application and integration of ITEKs with
   scientific ecological modelling systems possess tremendous potential to
   develop accurate scientific forecasts and reliable future predictions.},

Abstract = {This study investigates intended visitation behavior of tourists toward
   Rekawa wetland under anticipated climate change (CC) scenarios. An
   interview-based contingent visitation survey was conducted with 365
   foreign and domestic tourists to estimate the effects of CC on future
   visitation. Based on two IPCC scenarios using two direct and three
   indirect climatic factors, we composed a CC environmental index. The
   results show a decline in number of trips equal to 43 per cent and 53
   per cent under scenarios 1 and 2 respectively, but the difference is not
   significant. Foreign and domestic tourists differ significantly with
   regard to socio-demographic characteristics and beliefs about CC effects
   at Rekawa. Controlling for such differences, we demonstrate that foreign
   tourists are less likely than domestic tourists to reduce future
   visitation to Rekawa due to CC impacts. Still, the future of ecotourism
   at Rekawa wetland is at risk if adaptation measures are not taken to
   meet CC impacts.},

Title = {Seaweed farms provide refugia from ocean acidification},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {776},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Seaweed farming has been proposed as a strategy for adaptation to ocean
   acidification, but evidence is largely lacking. Changes of pH and carbon
   system parameters in surface waters of three seaweed farms along a
   latitudinal range in China were compared, on the weeks preceding
   harvesting, with those of the surrounding seawaters. Results confirmed
   that seaweed farming is efficient in buffering acidification, with
   Saccharina japonica showing the highest capacity of 0.10 pH increase
   within the aquaculture area, followed by Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis
   (Delta pH = 0.04) and Porphyra haitanensis (Delta pH = 0.03). The ranges
   of pH variability within seaweed farms spanned 0.14-0.30 unit during the
   monitoring, showing intense fluctuations which may also help marine
   organisms adapt to enhanced pH temporal variations in the future ocean.
   Deficit in pCO(2) in waters in seaweed farms relative to control waters
   averaged 58.7 +/- 15.9 mu atm, ranging from 27.3 to 113.9 mu atm across
   farms. However, Delta pH did not significantly differ between day and
   night. Dissolved oxygen and Omega(arag) were also elevated in surface
   waters at all seaweed farms, which are benefit for the survival of
   calcifying organisms. Seaweed farming, which unlike natural seaweed
   forests, is scalable and is not dependent on suitable substrate or light
   availability, could serve as a low-cost adaptation strategy to ocean
   acidification and deoxygenation and provide important refugia from ocean
   acidification. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in
   different climate zones in order to analyze the efficacy of UHI
   mitigation strategies. A base case urban canopy model was developed
   using statistical urban district information for Houston, Texas. The
   Urban Weather Generator (UWG) was employed to simulate the UHI effect
   during the hottest week of the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY3). Two
   case studies were conducted to represent the impacts of UHIs on the
   different climate zones. First, a case study was conducted to compare
   the UHI effect in various climate conditions. We controlled the urban
   morphology to estimate the effects of the climate zones on UHIs, but the
   UHI intensity outcomes still considerably differed from one another,
   ranging from 1.25 degrees C to 4.35 degrees C. Second, UHI mitigation
   strategies such as roof vegetation, trees, and grass coverage ratio were
   tested to measure their sensitivity in different climate conditions. The
   results show that green roofs have a marginal effect on UHI mitigation
   in high-rise urban morphology, while increases in grass and tree
   coverage ratios were effective, especially in hot climates. The results
   also indicate that the strategies employed should consider the climate's
   characteristics in order to encourage a more sustainable built
   environment},

Title = {Regime shifts, resilience and recovery of a cod stock},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {402},
Pages = {239-253},
Abstract = {In the North and Baltic seas Atlantic cod Gadus morhua stocks collapsed
   as part or one of the major factors inducing large-scale ecosystem
   regime shifts. Determining the relative contribution of overfishing and
   climate variability in causing these shifts has proven difficult. While
   facing similar climatic conditions, the Sound (i.e. a narrow strait
   located between the North and Baltic seas) differs from its neighbouring
   areas in the magnitude of fishing pressure as it is subjected to a local
   trawl fishing ban since 1932. By means of 3 independent multivariate
   analyses, we investigated the state and development of the Sound
   ecosystem, specifically testing for the occurrence of regime shifts and
   their potential drivers. By comparing the ecosystem development of the
   Sound with the neighbouring North and Baltic seas, we were able to
   demonstrate the positive effect of the trawl fishing ban on the
   resilience of the local cod stock to environmental change. The recovery
   and healthy condition of the Sound cod stock illustrate the need for
   adaptive marine management strategies that maximize ecosystem
   resilience.},

Abstract = {The self-thinning rule is fundamental in regulating maximum stocking and

   lanceolata Lamb.) Hook.) is the most important tree species and widely
   distributed across subtropical China. Yet, our understanding of how the
   self-thinning line of Chinese fir relates to climate is limited.
   Longitudinal data from 48 plots distributed in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi,
   and Sichuan provinces were used to describe self-thinning for Chinese
   fir in relation to climate through first-order autoregressive AR1)) and
   nonlinear mixed effects NLME) models. Results showed that self-thinning
   lines had steeper slopes for Chinese fir growing in areas with larger
   annual precipitation and summer mean maximum temperature but flatter
   slopes with higher mean annual temperature, degree-days below 0 degrees
   C, and winter mean minimum temperature. Winter mean minimum temperature
   was the dominant climatic factor in shaping self-thinning lines, which
   suggests that temperature was the key climate driver that affects
   self-thinning of Chinese fir. In addition, differences of slopes for any
   two of the four sites were significant, except between the Guangxi and
   Sichuan sites. Our results will be useful for both the silvicultural
   practices and mitigation strategies of Chinese fir under climate change

Title = {Environmental Sustainability and Supply Resilience of Cobalt},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cobalt (Co) is an essential metal for the development of
   energy-transition technologies, decarbonising transportation, achieving
   several sustainable development goals, and facilitating a future net
   zero transition. However, the supply of Co is prone to severe
   fluctuation, disruption, and price instabilities. This review aims to
   identify the future evolution of Co supply through technologically
   resilient and environmentally sustainable pathways. The work shows that
   advances in both primary and secondary sources, Co mining methods and
   recycling systems are yet to be fully optimised. Moreover, responsible
   sourcing from both large mines and small artisanal mines will be
   necessary for a resilient Co supply. Regulatory approaches may increase
   transparency, support local mining communities, and improve secondary Co
   recovery. Novel Co supply options, such as deep-sea mining and
   bio-mining of tailings, are associated with major techno-economic and
   environmental issues. However, a circular economy, keeping Co in the
   economic loop for as long as possible, is yet to be optimised at both
   regional and global scales. To achieve environmental sustainability of
   Co, economic incentives, regulatory push, and improved public perception
   are required to drive product innovation and design for circularity.
   Although the complexity of Co recycling, due to lack of standardisation
   of design and chemistry in batteries, is an impediment, a sustainable
   net zero transition using Co will only be possible if a reliable primary
   supply and a circular secondary supply are established.},

Title = {The impacts of environmental and socio-economic stressors on small scale
   fisheries and livelihoods of fishers in Ghana},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Small-scale coastal fisheries are exposed to many stressors, such as
   poor governance, lack of alternative employment, overfishing and
   diseases. Stressors, in this context, constitute environmental and
   socio-economic changes or events at local, national or global levels
   making the fisheries sector or fishers vulnerable. Climate change is
   expected to compound the consequences of these stressors on fisheries
   and livelihoods. Identifying and understanding the effects of important
   stressors are imperative for building and organising appropriate
   capacity to adapt and, ultimately, for successful adaptation. However,
   how climate-related and non-climate stressors jointly affect small-scale
   fisheries is still to be fully explored. In this paper, we use case
   studies of three coastal communities in,the Western Region of Ghana to
   gain insights into how multiple stressors combine to affect small-scale
   fisheries. The findings show that multiple stressors combine in complex
   ways, affecting fisheries-based livelihoods and the coastal landscape,
   vegetation and infrastructure. This suggests that any single stressor is
   just a part of a set of stressors that jointly affect small-scale
   coastal fisheries. This study proposes that the effects of
   climate-related stressors are better comprehended when analysed in light
   of the synergetic effect of multiple stressors. It has the potential to
   guide policy-makers and managers in designing and implementing improved
   strategies to enhance adaptive capacity in response to climate change.
   Moreover, this knowledge can present an opportunity and justification
   for solving other inherent developmental problems through climate change
   adaptation policies and actions.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise due to climate change poses a serious threat to human
   populations in coastal areas. In planning possible countermeasures, it
   is important to consider the potential economic risks and the cost of
   any proposed adaptation. This paper examines the cost effectiveness of
   adaptation measures that combine mangrove afforestation (green
   infrastructure) and dike construction (gray infrastructure) in areas
   considered to be at risk of inundation. Based on data for 112 countries
   and regions where mangrove forests are present along the coastline, the
   global benefit/cost ratio for the combination of dikes and mangrove is
   approximately 1.5 times higher than the ratio for dike-only protection.
   It was found that this type of multiple protection scheme can reduce the
   number of dikes required and the overall cost of adaptation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article explores the role of contextual neighborhood-level
   considerations in community resilience planning in coastal urban
   locations. A comparative case study analysis was conducted in three
   different locations in the City of Hampton, Virginia, that all share a
   common challenge of coastal flooding but have distinctly different
   neighborhood-level circumstances that shape their flood impacts and
   resilience building options. The research approach utilizes a
   co-production of knowledge and descriptive statistics to identify the
   overall flood risk and socioeconomic attributes of each locality that
   may influence broader citywide resilience investments within the realm
   of three overarching options: protection, accommodation, and relocation.
   It then applies a geospatial network analysis to determine which study
   neighborhoods will have significantly reduced access to critical
   facilities such as emergency services, medical facilities, and schools
   due to accelerated sea level rise as one of the key coastal hazards in
   this low-lying region. The results show that each case study location
   has its own unique contextual circumstances that define its preferences
   for different resilience strategies regardless of the actual flood risk.
   The results also highlight the importance of holistic assessment of
   granular conditions that play a critical role in prioritization of
   resource allocation and interventions in coastal municipalities.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {579-593},
Abstract = {Though humans have been fishing for food since they first created tools
   to hunt, modern food systems are predominately terrestrial focused and
   fish are frequently overlooked. Yet, within the global food system, fish
   play an important role in meeting current and future food needs. Capture
   fisheries are the last large-scale ``wild{''} food, and aquaculture is
   the fastest growing food production sector in the world. Currently,
   capture fisheries and aquaculture provide 4.3 billion people with at
   least 15\% of their animal protein. In addition to providing protein and
   calories, fish are important sources of critical vitamins and vital
   nutrients that are difficult to acquire through other food sources. As
   the climate changes, human populations will continue to grow, cultural
   tastes will evolve, and fish populations will respond. Sustainable
   fisheries and aquaculture are poised to fill demand for food not met by
   terrestrial food systems. Climate change and other global changes will
   increase, decrease, or modify many wild fish populations and aquaculture
   systems. Understanding the knowledge gaps around these implications for
   global change on fish production is critical. Applied research and
   adaptive management techniques can assist with the necessary evolution
   of sustainable food systems to include a stronger emphasis on fish and
   other aquatic organisms.},

Abstract = {Climate change is altering the distribution of foundation species, with
   potential effects on organisms that inhabit these environments and
   changes to valuable ecosystem functions. In the Gulf of Mexico, black
   mangroves (Avicennia germinans) are expanding northward into salt
   marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora (hereafter Spartina). Salt
   marshes are essential habitats for many organisms, including
   ecologically and economically important species such as blue crabs
   (Callinectes sapidus) and Penaeid shrimp (e.g., Penaeus aztecus), which
   may be affected by vegetation changes. Black mangroves occupied higher
   tidal elevations than Spartina, and Spartina was present only at its
   lowest tidal elevations in sites when mangroves were established. We
   compared nekton and infaunal communities within monoculture stands of
   Spartina that were bordered by mangroves to nearby areas where mangroves
   had not yet become established. Nekton and infaunal communities were
   significantly different in Spartina stands bordered by mangroves, even
   though salinity and temperature were not different. Overall abundance
   and biomass of nekton and infauna was significantly higher in marshes
   without mangroves, although crabs and fish were more abundant in
   mangrove areas. Black mangrove expansion as well as other ongoing
   vegetation shifts will continue in a warming climate. Understanding how
   these changes affect associated species is necessary for management,
   mitigation, and conservation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Climate change is resulting in heatwaves that are more frequent, severe,
   and longer lasting, which is projected to double-to-triple the
   heat-related mortality in Boston, MA if adequate climate change
   mitigation and adaptation strategies are not implemented. A case-only
   analysis was used to examine subject and small-area neighborhood
   characteristics that modified the association between hot days and
   mortality. Deaths of Boston, Massachusetts residents that occurred from
   2000-2015 were analyzed in relation to the daily temperature and heat
   index during the warm season as part of the case-only analysis. The
   modification by small-area (census tract, CT) social, and environmental
   (natural and built) factors was assessed. At-home mortality on hot days
   was driven by both social and environmental factors, differentially
   across the City of Boston census tracts, with a greater proportion of
   low-to-no income individuals or those with limited English proficiency
   being more highly represented among those who died during the study
   period; but small-area built environment features, like street trees and
   enhanced energy efficiency, were able to reduce the relative odds of
   death within and outside the home. At temperatures below current local
   thresholds used for heat warnings and advisories, there was increased
   relative odds of death from substance abuse and assault-related
   altercations. Geographic weighted regression analyses were used to
   examine these relationships spatially within a subset of at-home deaths
   with high-resolution temperature and humidity data. This revealed
   spatially heterogeneous associations between at-home mortality and
   social and environmental vulnerability factors.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to compare the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt Delta in Europe and
   the Taihu Basin part of the Yangtze River Delta in China from a
   long-term historical perspective. Urbanized deltas are among the most
   prosperous and populated regions in the world, but also the most
   vulnerable. To cope with growing uncertainty, their systematic
   comparison has become instrumental in building mutual learning on the
   theory and practice of spatial planning and water resource management in
   such vulnerable contexts. Based on a systematic comparative mapping
   approach of Delta Urbanism with critical review of policies, this
   research highlights important similarities between these two deltas in
   terms of physical characteristics, dense occupation, and management
   history evolving from a decentralized polder-based system to a
   centralized control model, and a recent adoption of integrated and
   adaptive water management strategies. On the other hand, the comparison
   reveals distinct management focuses in current delta plans, as well as
   contrasting approaches to public participation and historical hydraulic
   landscapes. It is found from this comparative study that, beyond the
   socio-cultural specificities that can explain the distinct management
   practice of each region, the systematic use of mapping as a
   visualization and communication tool would facilitate integrative and
   adaptive delta management.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion is a complex and increasingly important problem, largely
   due to its effects and management strategies. The current context of
   climate change, together with centuries of human occupation of
   shorelines, adds pressure for the development of sustainable coastal
   management policies, the success of which crucially depends on the
   consideration of all stakeholders' perspectives. This research
   investigates users' preferences over alternative options of coastal
   erosion management. Through the implementation of a discrete choice
   experiment, respondents' preferences regarding management alternatives
   are elicited, and their willingness to pay for alternatives' attributes
   is estimated. The results show that respondents prefer some
   interventions to mitigate the problem rather than no action, and prefer
   lighter intervention (palisades, gangways) to heavy infrastructures
   (rockfills, seawalls, groynes). Moreover, the results show the presence
   of preference heterogeneity and thus the need to use more flexible and
   complex models. Based on the results obtained, it is possible to drive
   some policy implications. First, the do-nothing option is not viable
   from the population's standpoint; second, although some type of coastal
   erosion protection is demanded by the general population, the preferred
   approach is for light forms, contrary to the policy adopted in the last
   century, and still overwhelmingly present in the territory. Lastly,
   given the considerable heterogeneity in respondents' preferences,
   careful consideration of the welfare impact of coastal interventions by
   population segments is required.},

Abstract = {Australian communities are lobbying governments to improve regulation of
   the Coal Seam Gas (CSG), a fast growing industry. This article examines
   the effect of CSG extraction on agriculture, water resources and
   ecosystems in Queensland where CSG development is most intense.
   Supporters of the industry view Queensland's regulatory framework as
   best-practice'. Whilst policy documents adopt an adaptive management'
   framework, legislation provides an enabling environment for industry,
   allowing unlimited volumes of groundwater to be extracted as a
   by-product. In an important agricultural region, the Darling Downs,
   irrigators who access groundwater in the same area as the CSG mining are
   experiencing water quality and quantity problems. Regulation provides
   limited make-good' arrangements for individuals if groundwater wells
   suffer impact. While potential impacts on individual wells and farmers
   are locally significant, there is limited recognition of cumulative risk
   management of CSG development at the regional scale. Contrasting two
   risk assessment approaches, the authors suggest a more appropriate
   pre-emptive regulatory framework for a stronger focus on cumulative risk
   management to satisfactorily address sustainable water management,
   irrigated agriculture and development issues. Lessons may assist other
   countries grappling with managing impacts on agriculture and the
   environment.},

Title = {Barriers and opportunities for beneficial reuse of sediment to support
   coastal resilience},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {195},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {As urbanization and climate change alter sediment fluxes, relative sea
   level, and coastal erosion around the world, management of sediment as a
   resource is increasingly important. Sediment is needed to enhance marsh
   accretion rates, raise the grade elevation of development, and build up
   beaches and dunes. Beneficial reuse of sediment refers to the
   repurposing of local sources of sediment for these applications,
   material typically available from dredging or sediment capture
   infrastructure, and represents a more sustainable approach compared to
   the status-quo involving transport to and from distant locations.
   However, in many locations, beneficial reuse remains a concept or is
   constrained to small-scale applications. In this paper, we draw on
   interviews with coastal sediment managers and regulators in Southern
   California to identify barriers to beneficial reuse and opportunities to
   overcome them. Interviewees reported numerous regulatory, technical,
   psychological, financial, and inter- organizational barriers in their
   watersheds and regions. By highlighting these barriers, we aim to
   identify systemic changes that would make beneficial reuse a realistic
   and accessible option for Southern California and elsewhere. Most
   prominently, a more flexible regulatory framework that allows sediment
   management practices to adapt over time, pilot studies to understand how
   beneficial reuse works in various settings, and educational programs for
   regulators and the public could make beneficial reuse a more widespread
   approach.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts, such as deforestation, soil erosion, and carbon
   dioxide emissions, have a negative influence over global warming due to
   the increase of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The sustainable forest
   management is a way to mitigate climate change owing to the carbon
   storage capacity of forests. This study highlights the priority of
   forest management according to the integrated assessment of carbon
   storage under anthropogenic impacts in the administrative units of
   Ecuador. In the obtained map, the provinces Guayas, Esmeraldas, and
   Manabi showed the highest values of 25, 22.85 and 19.9, respectively,
   followed by two Amazon provinces, Morona Santiago and Sucumbios.
   Therefore, we concluded that deforestation, soil erosion, and carbon
   dioxide emissions were more pronounced on the coast mainly due to
   agriculture and livestock activities and the forests in these provinces
   must have priority management. This analysis is useful for planning
   environmental practices in order to increase carbon storage as a
   strategy of mitigation for global warming.},

Title = {Energy-efficient mitigation measures for improving indoor thermal
   comfort during heat waves},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {278},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Urban areas are increasingly impacted by the urban heat island effect,
   especially during heat waves. In the context of improving energy
   efficiency in buildings, passive and energy-efficient cooling methods
   are needed for reducing indoor heat stress and lowering building energy
   consumption during heat waves. In this study, a whole building
   simulation model that includes both moisture and heat transport in wall
   envelopes and indoor environment is developed. An analytical solution
   and two test cases are used to validate the developed model. The
   developed model is applied to study indoor thermal conditions in urban
   areas in Zurich, Switzerland in a hot summer. The results show that
   indoor temperature could not be accurately simulated when moisture
   transport in the wall envelopes is neglected. Due to the urban heat
   island effect, night ventilation is not sufficient to cool down the
   indoor environment during the heat wave in the urban area. The potential
   of precooling before the heat wave and moisture-desorption cooling from
   hygroscopic materials have been studied to reduce indoor heat stress in
   the urban area. The average operative temperature during the heat wave
   can be reduced by 0.43 degrees C by precooling before the start of the
   heat wave, whereas desorption cooling from hygroscopic materials could
   reduce the average operative temperature during heat waves by 1.31
   degrees C. A combination of these two mitigation measures could lead to
   enhanced passive cooling effect. There is a large potential of using
   desorption of hygroscopic material to reduce heat stress during
   heatwaves, while minimizing energy consumption of buildings.},

Abstract = {This thematic issue on Asian Large Marine Ecosystems focuses attention
   on a major geographic area of the world where the goods and services of
   13 Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are serving the needs of three billion
   people inhabiting the region. The stressors affecting the sustainable
   development of the Asian LMEs are impacting the economies of the
   bordering countries from overfishing, pollution, nutrient
   overenrichment, habitat degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate
   change. The papers in this issue represent a cross-section of assessment
   studies underway by marine scientists, policy specialists, and resource
   managers in the region engaged in a movement to introduce
   ecosystem-based management practices for mitigating stressors on LMEs.
   This movement is supported, in part, by an independent international
   financial entity, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which exists to
   help meet the objectives of international environmental conventions and
   agreements. The movement towards ecosystem-based management is supported
   by the GEF to advance a United Nations effort to assist economically
   developing nations in the Asian region and in other regions around the

Abstract = {The Port of Los Angeles has developed a Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan
   to address the impacts of sea level rise. Mean sea levels have risen
   four inches in the Los Angeles area over the last century. With global
   sea levels projected to continue to rise, public and private shoreline
   assets will become more vulnerable to an increase in the frequency and
   magnitude of coastal flood events. This plan identifies the areas of the
   nation's leading seaport that are projected to be exposed to sea level
   rise by years 2030, 2050, and 2100, provides an overview of the port's
   asset vulnerabilities, and presents a suite of strategies to both adapt
   over time and become more resilient to sea level rise. Port assets are
   categorized as follows: cargo wharves and miscellaneous operations,
   critical facilities, transportation (rail/roads), community assets, and
   natural habitats. This paper provides an overview of the methodology
   taken to develop the adaptation plan including: determining sea level
   rise projections, completing the asset inventory, developing sea level
   rise maps, a vulnerability assessment, development of adaptation
   strategies, cost impacts, and identification of implementation
   priorities.},

Title = {Challenges for local adaptation when governance scales overlap. Evidence

Abstract = {In coastal areas around the world, actors are responding to multiple
   global changes by implementing adaptation plans, often confined within a
   single-focal perspective with few explanations of targeted changes and
   cross-scale interactions. To better anticipate the raising coordination
   issues and the potential feedbacks generated by adaptation in these
   complex social-ecological systems where governance scales overlap, we
   used the robustness framework (Anderies et al. 2004; Anderies 2015). We
   analyzed a case study along the Languedoc coastline in southern France,
   where governance is organized in multiple jurisdictions which we
   considered as interlinked adaptation situations. We identified three
   interacting changes impacting adaptation: demographic growth, climate
   change, and large-scale political changes, such as decentralization. We
   used the examples of land-use planning and coastal management to
   illustrate the major coordination challenges facing the implementation
   of adaptation plans in coastal areas by various intertwined communities.
   In the example of land-use planning, adaptation is impacted by
   miscoordination between multiple sectors that all rely on a shared
   resource, land, thus putting more pressure on the decision-makers to
   make explicit trade-offs between multiple issues. Coastal management
   illustrated how emerging adaptation strategies created new
   interdependencies in the system and how these were hardly considered due
   to confusion in the devolution of responsibility between multiple
   jurisdictions. In both examples, using coupled and evolving robustness
   diagrams was helpful in revealing renewed fragilities, foreseeing
   consequences of adaptation in inter-related decisional contexts, and
   promoting collective action to redefine the boundaries of adaptation
   situations and their coordination to cope with converging changes along
   coastlines.},

Title = {Risk of extreme events in delta environment: A case study of the
   Mahanadi delta},

Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is considered as one of the greatest
   environmental, social and economic threats to the future world. Low
   lying deltas all over the world are increasingly subjected to
   multidimensional risk of sea level rise, cyclone, surges and
   salinisation. The life and livelihood of the communities of such deltas
   are endangered due to climate change acting as risk multiplier. The
   Mahanadi delta in the state of Odisha, India is one of the such populous
   deltas with estimated 8 million population in 2011 with a density of 613
   persons/km(2). Over the past decades, it experienced major climatic
   threats in the form of cyclone, surge inundation and flooding with
   variable intensities and impacts along and across the coast. The present
   research assessed the risk of climatic extreme events and their
   variability in the delta, with an intention of mitigation or adaptation
   to possible impacts in specific region. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
   data and daily rainfall data were used to extract flood inundation.
   Tropical Cyclone Risk Model (TCRM) along with surge decay function was
   used to estimate cyclonic wind speed and surge inundation and risk
   indices were computed using fuzzy logic based approach. The result shows
   that in the coastal districts, risk of severe cyclones rank above the
   heavy floods. Agriculture, the main livelihood of these districts (71\%)
   is impacted adversely making the delta community vulnerable to such
   extreme events. Kendrapara followed by Bhadrak and Jagasinghpur
   districts appear to be most risk prone segment in the delta making the
   northern part comparatively more risk prone where focused mitigation and
   adaptation actions are needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Integrated Modeling to Evaluate Climate Change Impacts on Coupled
   Social-Ecological Systems in Alaska},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {The Alaska Climate Integrated Modeling (ACLIM) project represents a
   comprehensive, multi-year, interdisciplinary effort to characterize and
   project climate-driven changes to the eastern Bering Sea (EBS)
   ecosystem, from physics to fishing communities. Results from the ACLIM
   project are being used to understand how different regional fisheries
   management approaches can help promote adaptation to climate-driven
   changes to sustain fish and shellfish populations and to inform managers
   and fishery dependent communities of the risks associated with different
   future climate scenarios. The project relies on iterative communications
   and outreaches with managers and fishery-dependent communities that have
   informed the selection of fishing scenarios. This iterative approach
   ensures that the research team focuses on policy relevant scenarios that
   explore realistic adaptation options for managers and communities.
   Within each iterative cycle, the interdisciplinary research team
   continues to improve: methods for downscaling climate models,
   climate-enhanced biological models, socio-economic modeling, and
   management strategy evaluation (MSE) within a common analytical
   framework. The evolving nature of the ACLIM framework ensures improved
   understanding of system responses and feedbacks are considered within
   the projections and that the fishing scenarios continue to reflect the
   management objectives of the regional fisheries management bodies. The
   multi-model approach used for projection of biological responses,
   facilitates the quantification of the relative contributions of climate
   forcing scenario, fishing scenario, parameter, and structural
   uncertainty with and between models. Ensemble means and variance within
   and between models inform risk assessments under different future
   scenarios. The first phase of projections of climate conditions to the
   end of the 21st century is complete, including projections of catch for
   core species under baseline (status quo) fishing conditions and two
   alternative fishing scenarios are discussed. The ACLIM modeling
   framework serves as a guide for multidisciplinary integrated climate
   impact and adaptation decision making in other large marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to examine the issues of environment and
   climate change policy gaps and their impacts on the natural resources
   and ecosystems in southwest coastal Bangladesh. The effects of the
   increasing human activities as well as natural disasters due to the
   environment and climate change are analysed. The policy options as a
   response to mitigation, adaptation and possible human suffering as
   consequences are explored through discourse analysis.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study applied focus group
   discussions, workshop and field visits to collect the data and
   information to explore environment and climate change policy-related
   problems.
   Findings - It was found that there is a need for major policy reform to
   guide development interventions to reverse salinity, waterlogging,
   migration and groundwater recharging problems for sustainable
   environmental and ecosystem management in the region.
   Originality/value - The paper then underscores the need for governments
   at all levels to adequately fund geo-information-based development
   interventions as adequate and proactive responses to environmental
   management and development to combat future environmental and climate
   change problems in the region.},

Abstract = {Nature-based solutions are rapidly gaining interest in the face of
   global change and increasing flood risks. While assessments of flood
   risk mitigation by coastal ecosystems are mainly restricted to local
   scales, our study assesses the contribution of salt marshes and
   mangroves to nature-based storm surge mitigation in 11 large deltas
   around the world. We present a relatively simple GIS model that, based
   on globally available input data, provides an estimation of the tidal
   wetland's capacity of risk mitigation at a regional scale. It shows the
   high potential of nature-based solutions, as tidal wetlands, to provide
   storm surge mitigation to more than 80\% of the flood-exposed land area
   for 4 of the 11 deltas and to more than 70\% of the flood-exposed
   population for 3 deltas. The magnitude of the nature-based mitigation,
   estimated as the length of the storm surge pathway crossing through
   tidal wetlands, was found to be significantly correlated to the total
   wetland area within a delta. This highlights the importance of
   conserving extensive continuous tidal wetlands as a nature-based
   approach to mitigate flood risks. Our analysis further reveals that
   deltas with limited historical wetland reclamation and therefore large
   remaining wetlands, such as the Mississippi, the Niger, and part of the
   Ganges-Brahmaputra deltas, benefit from investing in the conservation of
   their vast wetlands, while deltas with extensive historical wetland
   reclamation, such as the Yangtze and Rhine deltas, may improve the
   sustainability of flood protection programs by combining existing hard
   engineering with new nature-based solutions through restoration of
   former wetlands.},

Title = {Adaptation to climate change: A study on regional urban water management
   and planning practice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {355},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Advancing knowledge on how climate change impacts on water resources is
   considered a priority in the academic world. This paper studies the
   strategies adopted by urban water professionals in the tropical region
   of Queensland, Australia to minimise the impacts of climate change on
   the regional urban water supply network. In the recent past, the dry
   tropical urban region of Queensland has faced a climate-induced water
   crisis (2014-2018). This article investigates the urban water
   distribution authorities' planning and operational practices as part of
   climate change adaptation in the study region. Water professionals from
   the local urban water authorities were interviewed using a comprehensive
   range of questionnaires. Although the impacts of climate change on
   different water supply sources have been investigated in many parts of
   Queensland, the adaptation measures taken by the local authorities
   appear to be random and unplanned. Holistic implementation of climate
   change adaptation is rare and at its infancy stage due to the lack of
   quantifiable implementation frameworks or an audit process. The result
   shows resource constraints and lack of government support are the two
   major barriers to climate change adaptation in the water sector. Some
   water practitioners believe that the local urban water authorities have
   done a reasonable job on climate change adaptations in bits and pieces
   considering a wide range of local challenges such as lack of support
   from stakeholders, limited resources, and technology. Some other
   participants believe that too much attention on climate change will
   cause a noticeable problem in economic activities unless concerns from
   all stakeholders receive equal attention and are addressed. This is an
   important point and deserves proper acknowledgement to overcome relevant
   political and community barriers to climate change adaptation. The study
   concludes with a critical discussion on various strands of climate
   change adaptation to address the long-term regional urban water supply
   security challenges.},

Title = {Understanding the vulnerability of migrants in Shanghai to typhoons},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {60},

Pages = {1189-1210},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {China has experienced considerable migration from inland to coastal
   areas since the reforms of 1978, with migrants becoming an important
   population in many coastal cities. Compared with non-migrants (long-term
   residents), migrant vulnerability to typhoons is considered high due to
   limited access to job opportunities, social security, information, and
   other resources; however, there is no research on vulnerability of this
   population sector to natural hazards. This initial study analysed the
   perceptions and personal experiences of migrants living in Shanghai of
   typhoon hazards. During May 2010, empirical data were collected using an
   online questionnaire and face-face interviews. Response data indicated
   that risk knowledge of migrants was significantly lower than among
   non-migrants; differing risk perceptions between the groups were
   consistent with levels of personal typhoon experience; statistically
   significant differences in hazard knowledge within the sample also
   related to education and occupation; a variety of strategies to cope
   with typhoon hazards was being applied by residential committees; and
   that migrants were not generally recognised as a vulnerable group
   requiring special consideration in hazard risk management. To reduce the
   vulnerability of migrants to typhoons, we recommend expanding the range
   of accessible communication technologies distributing warning
   information; organising more educational and training programmes, at
   government and corporate level, to increase community awareness of
   natural hazards; encouraging local residential committees to promote
   social networks and engagement for migrants; and providing corporate
   incentives to develop insurances specifically for migrant needs. Further
   research is necessary to assess the differences in vulnerability between
   different types of migrants.},

Abstract = {Societal Impact StatementEcosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is
   increasingly being used to reduce the impacts of climate change on
   vulnerable people and landscapes. The international EbA South project
   implemented EbA interventions across three countries (Mauritania, Nepal,
   the Seychelles), piloting the restoration of mountain, desert and
   coastal ecosystems to enhance the climate resilience of local
   communities. The experiences of the EbA South project across these
   distinct ecosystems and socio-economic environments provide unique
   insights into the adaptive management invariably required within EbA
   initiatives. This analysis also provides lessons on how to share
   knowledge among different stakeholders and countries to advance
   South-South cooperation.
   SummaryClimate change is having an increasingly negative impact on the
   world's most vulnerable societies. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) uses
   biodiversity and ecosystem services to help local communities adapt to
   the adverse impacts of climate change. This approach, which has the
   potential to be implemented across a wide range of ecosystem types and
   scales, is increasingly being adopted by governments and international
   donors within climate change adaptation initiatives. The objective of
   the EbA South project was to enhance the climate resilience of
   communities in Mauritania, Nepal, and the Seychelles by building
   institutional capacity, mobilizing knowledge and transferring EbA
   technologies based on China's experience in successfully implementing
   restoration. The project implemented EbA interventions in the drylands
   of Mauritania, Himalayan forests in Nepal, and the coastal zone of the
   Seychelles. All interventions were carefully monitored by researchers to
   generate scientific evidence of the impacts of EbA. Here, we provide
   implementers of EbA with the major lessons learned from the EbA South
   project, namely: (a) quantifying the full suite of ecosystem goods and
   services generated through EbA at a landscape scale; (b) budgeting in
   advance for management of time-consuming complexities related to
   socioeconomics and ecology such as land-use conflict, ineffective
   government structures, disagreements regarding intervention options, and
   challenging environmental conditions; (c) undertaking long-term research
   for adaptive management and documenting the project's successes; (d)
   providing platforms for effective communication and collaboration among
   stakeholders with different first languages; and (e) regularly adjusting
   exit strategies for maintenance of the EbA landscapes after closure of
   the project.},

Abstract = {This work analyses coastal erosion causes, impacts and management
   strategies in two sandstone cliffs in SW Spain: El Almirante (EA) and
   Fuente del Gallo (FG). Five sets of aerial photographs spanning the last
   50 years were used, combined with detailed field inspection. Retreat
   rate of the cliff top in EA is 0.8-1.6 m/yr, increasing over the last
   decade to 4 m/yr at some points. This poses a serious risk for
   infrastructure located on the cliff top, and cliff recession leaves an
   outstanding palaeontological site exposed to wave attack. Erosion rates
   in FG are lower, but there is a significant risk to beach visitors due
   to mass movements involved in cliff retreat. Interventions to mitigate
   erosion impacts in EA have consisted in tetrapod deployment and concrete
   fencing, while in FG stabilization measures include removal of unstable
   blocks, soil nailing, draining tubes, seeding, a riprap and beach
   nourishments. However, these measures have only had a limited success,
   as the main causes for cliff erosion are related to marine and subaerial
   processes enhanced by rainfall and cliff fractures. Undermining of the
   cliff base by waves in FG and in eastern EA triggers rock falls, which
   are easily dismantled by waves, resulting in a rapidly retreating cliff
   face. In central EA rotational slides are responsible for cliff top
   recession, favoured by a plastic substratum of marls. Future projections
   of shoreline position indicate a likely increase in potential damage
   generated by erosion in both sites, leading to the need for adopting
   alternative mitigation measures.},

Title = {Island biodiversity hotspots are getting hotter: vulnerability of tree
   species to climate change in New Caledonia},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {201},
Pages = {111-119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Future patterns of biodiversity have been extensively explored to design
   conservation strategies in large continental hotspots. However, little
   research has focused on island hotspots, although limited opportunities
   to migrate and the inherent characteristics of island species are likely
   to cause sensitivity to rapid environmental changes. This study
   addresses the question of how climate change could affect species
   richness in New Caledonia, the world's smallest biodiversity hotspot. An
   individual species distribution model was built for 469 native tree
   species and projected according to nine climate change scenarios.
   Results indicated that the range size of 87-96\% of species will have
   declined by 2070, 52-84\% will lose at least half of their current
   range, and 0-15\% will become extinct. Surprisingly, these predictions
   did not significantly exceed those for larger biodiversity hotspots.
   Underlying reasons may include an oceanic buffering effect that
   attenuates increases in air temperature, and the complex topography that
   generates micro-refugia. Major losses in local species richness were
   predicted to occur on ultramafic substrates and at mid-elevation. Loss
   on ultramafic substrates may stem from the number of
   ultramafic-specialist species that will lack a suitable climate on this
   specific substrate, while substrate-ubiquitous species are more likely
   to find refugia. Loss at mid-elevation could mirror a shift in optimum
   temperature-precipitation value, whose role in shaping the current
   pattern of diversity may have been overestimated by the models.
   Hopefully, these results will encourage further research to define the
   right mitigation and adaptation strategies on oceanic islands, where
   extinctions would contribute disproportionally to global biodiversity
   decline. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose Climate change poses diverse, often fundamental, challenges to
   livelihoods of island peoples. The purpose of this study is to
   demonstrate that these challenges must be better understood before
   effective and sustainable adaptation is possible.
   Design/methodology/approach Understanding past livelihood impacts from
   climate change can help design and operationalize future interventions.
   In addition, globalization has had uneven effects on island
   countries/jurisdictions, producing situations especially in
   archipelagoes where there are significant differences between core and
   peripheral communities. This approach overcomes the problems that have
   characterized many recent interventions for climate-change adaptation in
   island contexts which have resulted in uneven and at best only marginal
   livelihood improvements in preparedness for future climate change.
   Findings Island contexts have a range of unique vulnerability and
   resilience characteristics that help explain recent and proposed
   responses to climate change. These include the sensitivity of coastal
   fringes to climate-environmental changes: and in island societies, the
   comparatively high degrees of social coherence, closeness to nature and
   spirituality that are uncommon in western contexts.
   Research limitations/implications Enhanced understanding of island
   environmental and social contexts, as well as insights from past climate
   impacts and peripherality, all contribute to more effective and
   sustainable future interventions for adaptation.
   Originality/value The need for more effective and sustainable adaptation
   in island contexts is becoming ever more exigent as the pace of
   twenty-first-century climate change increases.},

Title = {Information sharing and emergency response coordination},
Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {130},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In recent years there has been an increase in commercial activities in
   the Arctic, including maritime traffic. This increase has led to
   economic development but may increase the risk of unwanted incidents.
   Concerns have been raised regarding the emergency response capacity of
   states to respond to maritime incidents effectively. Efforts from
   several agencies and also from neighboring countries may be needed. The
   coordination of such operations is facilitated by established incident
   command systems that define managerial roles, responsibilities, and
   information flows between individuals and organizations participating in
   rescue-work in large-scale crises. However, because of contextual
   challenges in the Arctic, the tactical and operational management-levels
   may have to adapt and improvise both their organizational structure and
   tasks to function efficiently.
   This paper has focused on how the different managerial roles influence
   information sharing between the participants in a complex rescue
   operation. The study is based on an in-depth case-study of a rescue
   operation in the waters around Svalbard, that is, the high Arctic. We
   demonstrate how information-sharing, coordination mechanisms, and
   managerial roles may need to be adapted during rescue operations to
   handle volatile operational conditions. The implications of our findings
   for the planning of mass rescue operations are reflected upon, in
   particular, the need for adaptive approaches to emergency response.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Long-lasting heatwaves have seriously threatened human health. Exploring
   the distribution of heat vulnerability is important for urban risk
   management. A model of heat vulnerability coupled with physical and
   social conditions based on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation was
   established in Chongqing, a mountainous megacity in China, and 11
   indicators were adopted to assess heat vulnerability. Heat perception
   evaluated by social media data is used to validate heat vulnerability.
   Four primary outcomes emerged. First, integration of high physical and
   low social heat vulnerabilities was found in central areas, while low
   physical and high social heat vulnerabilities were concentrated in
   suburban areas. Second, the spatial distribution of heat vulnerability
   is consistent with that of heat perception. Third, high social exposure,
   high physical and social sensitivity, and low physical adaptation led to
   high heat vulnerability in central areas, while high heat vulnerability
   in suburban areas was primarily caused by high physical exposure and low
   social adaptation. Finally, due to the barriers of mountains and rivers,
   both physical and social heat vulnerabilities form unique decentralized
   patterns following urbanization. According to the finding of heat
   vulnerability, mitigative and adaptive strategies (e.g. hierarchical
   layouts, green measures, and vulnerable health databases) are proposed
   to improve climate resilience.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {97},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-120},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The necessity of an effective risk management in urban coastal zone
   increases, while the climate change creates unpredictable natural
   hazards. It is therefore very important to develop and implement
   analytical tools able to assist decision-makers to reveal vulnerable
   areas and prioritize relevant mitigation and adaptation measures. This
   article focuses on the applicability of the Coastal City Flooding
   Vulnerability Index (CCFVI) in zones of coastal cities belonging to the
   same country and incorporating industrial activities. It targets at
   investigating the capacity of the CCFVI to adequately take account of
   the impact of the industrial characteristics that are developed in the
   study areas on their vulnerability to coastal flooding. The results
   reveal the reduced discriminative capacity of the ``administrative and
   institutional{''} subsystem in a centrally planned governance model like
   the one followed in Greece. They furthermore indicate the need for
   adding a separate indicators' subsystem, which will be able to measure
   the special features of the case study. Specifically, the industrial
   activity in the urban domain could severely impact the vulnerability of
   the area and should therefore be considered in designing the risk
   management plans for these areas. Moreover, the importance of weighting
   the indicators used in the vulnerability index calculation is
   emphasized.},

   importance of evidence-based conservation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {161-166},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Increased coastal development and rising sea levels as a result of
   continuing climate-change put coastal regions at risk from flooding and
   inundation. A common mitigation response is the construction and upgrade
   of hard coastal protection structures, such as breakwaters, seawalls,
   and groynes. The alteration of the coast, together with the introduction
   of novel materials into coastal waters can negatively impact adjacent
   habitats and associated organisms. The implementation of management
   plans that involve scientists, as well as a variety of other
   stakeholders offer an opportunity to minimise adverse effects to
   biodiversity or even enhance it, while still protecting infrastructure
   and people. This study examines the management of an Australian
   breakwater upgrade and the progressive design finding process, including
   stakeholder engagement, determination of assessment criteria, and
   environmental impact assessment. In the course of the latter, scientific
   research led to the rediscovery of a presumed extinct algal species,
   Nereia lophocladia, which created an additional challenge and
   temporarily halted the upgrade. To accommodate this, the breakwater
   design solution was modified to avoid any impacts on the algal
   population and, in order to maximise the species' survival, novel
   ecological engineering approaches were proposed as mitigation
   strategies. Our case study underpins the value of evidence-based
   conservation and cooperation among stakeholders as important tools for
   minimising ecological impacts from coastal infrastructure upgrades.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Climate change will worsen the high levels of urban vulnerability in
   Latin American cities due to specific environmental stressors. Some
   impacts of climate change, such as high temperatures in urban
   environments, have not yet been addressed through adaptation strategies,
   which are based on poorly supported data. These impacts remain outside
   the scope of urban planning. New spatially explicit approaches that
   identify highly vulnerable urban areas and include specific adaptation
   requirements are needed in current urban planning practices to cope with
   heat hazards. In this paper, a heat vulnerability index is proposed for
   Santiago, Chile. The index was created using a GIS-based spatial
   information system and was constructed from spatially explicit indexes
   for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity levels derived from
   remote sensing data and socio-economic information assessed via
   principal component analysis (PCA). The objective of this study is to
   determine the levels of heat vulnerability at local scales by providing
   insights into these indexes at the intra city scale. The results reveal
   a spatial pattern of heat vulnerability with strong variations among
   individual spatial indexes. While exposure and adaptive capacities
   depict a clear spatial pattern, sensitivity follows a complex spatial
   distribution. These conditions change when examining PCA results,
   showing that sensitivity is more robust than exposure and adaptive
   capacity. These indexes can be used both for urban planning purposes and
   for proposing specific policies and measures that can help minimize heat
   hazards in highly dynamic urban areas. The proposed methodology can be
   applied to other Latin American cities to support policy making.},

Abstract = {Slivers of land amidst the world's third largest barrier reef, the
   Florida Keys provide unique insights on the emerging challenges
   associated with adaptation to global climate change. While political
   will and public awareness are gradually shifting on the imposing risks,
   analysis of survey responses from experts and decision makers serving
   the Florida Keys (federal, state and local personnel) reveals
   insufficient resources, limited direction and leadership, and lack of
   institutional frameworks to facilitate the adaptation process. Against
   this backdrop, we investigate experts and decision makers' interest in
   an array of adaptation measures including their willingness to support a
   proposed `Community Adaptation Fund' (CAF) to mobilize resources and lay
   the foundation for adaptation initiatives in the Florida Keys. We also
   explore potential funding sources for establishing the proposed CAF, and
   test the feasibility of a diverse set of financing mechanisms. We
   discuss implications of our findings in the context of enhancing
   adaptive capacity in the Florida Keys and beyond.},

Title = {Intraspecific hybridization as a mitigation strategy of ocean
   acidification in marine bivalve noble scallop Chlamys nobilis},

Abstract = {bivalves. Hybridization is one of the important methods to improve
   environmental tolerance of animals and plants. In this study, we
   explored the feasibility of intraspecific hybridization as an OA
   mitigation strategy in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis (ecologically and
   economically important bivalve species). The results of this study
   revealed that exposure of C. nobilis to OA condition significantly
   reduced the hatching rate, survival rate, growth rate (shell height,
   shell length, shell width and shell weight), and total carotenoid
   content (TCC), as well as increased the deformity rate of C. nobilis
   larvae. Interestingly, under both ambient water and OA condition, the
   intraspecific hybridization of C. nobilis exhibited heterosis in terms
   of hatching rate, survival rate and growth rate (excepted for growth in
   shell length under OA). Transcriptome sequencing of C. nobilis (inbreed
   and hybrid under ambient and OA conditions) identified four main
   differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction,
   biological process maintenances, nucleic acid binding and
   post-translational modification. In addition, the expression of these
   four genes in hybrid C. nobilis was significantly higher than that in
   inbreed C. nobilis. In conclusion, hybrid C. nobilis showed heterosis in
   growth rate and survival rate under both ambient water and acidified
   seawater condition, which may be the result of enhanced expression of
   genes related to signal transduction, DNA replication and
   post-translational modification.},

Journal = {WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {337-348},
Abstract = {Like many irrigation schemes in Central Asia, the one in Khorezm faces a
   two-fold challenge: on the one side, the severe problems inherited from
   the past need to be remedied and on the other side, the rising
   supply-demand gap driven by sharpening competition for water and climate
   change must be dealt with. Located in the lower part of the Amu Darya
   basin, Khorezm irrigation and drainage scheme is particularly vulnerable
   to supply-demand gaps. Promising solutions towards adaptation comprise
   modified strategies of land and water use towards higher efficiency and
   flexibility in combination with measures to lessen the constraints of
   the system itself, which was initially designed for the management of a
   few, large and uniform production units and not for many diverse and
   small units. Solutions consist of flexible, modeling-based approaches,
   re-arranging institutional settings and establishing economic incentive
   systems. Flexible modeling allows an integrated use of surface and
   groundwater resources avoiding or minimizing the impact of water stress
   on yield. Institutional settings strengthen the position of water users
   via improved participation and transparency of processes in Water
   Consumers Associations (WCAs). Economic measures support sustainable
   resource use strategies and improve the functioning of WCAs. The
   findings could be extrapolated to other regions of Central Asia with
   similar conditions and challenges.},

Abstract = {For many marine species and habitats, climate change and overfishing
   present a double threat. To manage marine resources effectively, it is
   necessary to adapt management to changes in the physical environment.
   Simple relationships between environmental conditions and fish abundance
   have long been used in both fisheries and fishery management. In many
   cases, however, physical, biological, and human variables feed back on
   each other. For these systems, associations between variables can change
   as the system evolves in time. This can obscure relationships between
   population dynamics and environmental variability, undermining our
   ability to forecast changes in populations tied to physical processes.
   Here we present a methodology for identifying physical forcing variables
   based on nonlinear forecasting and show how the method provides a
   predictive understanding of the influence of physical forcing on Pacific
   sardine.},

Journal = {DISASTERS},
Abstract = {This paper contains transdisciplinary reflections from both scientists
   and local NGO (nongovernmental organisation) managers on the
   international small island tourism destination of Gili Trawangan,
   Indonesia. These viewpoints centre on the impacts of, as well as the
   short- and long-term adaptation strategies and sustainability
   opportunities associated with, two disasters that occurred in rapid
   succession: the earthquakes that struck Lombok in 2018; and the COVID-19
   pandemic that began in 2020. A brief review of the governance challenges
   facing Gili Trawangan sets up the analysis of the findings and the
   presentation of new empirical insights into how the island's communities
   have dealt with two unique disaster scenarios over the past three years.
   The paper draws on a community resilience framework premised on social
   capital and collective action theories to position the island's ability
   to transition towards sustainable tourism in the wake of the COVID-19
   pandemic. It concludes by laying out sustainability opportunities going
   forward.},

Abstract = {Human activities and climate change have profound effects on marine
   ecosystems, leading to changes in ecosystem functionality and even
   reduced resilience. Hence, a systematic assessment of the marine
   ecosystem resilience and the drivers of resilience is needed. This study
   provides an approach to help measure the resilience of reduction marine
   ecosystems by calculating early warning signs of marine net primary
   productivity, while introducing fishing activities and environmental
   data in the study area to evaluate the factors affecting marine
   ecosystem resilience. The results showed that in 36.29\% of the Chinese
   exclusive economic zone, resilience was likely to be significantly
   decreased. There was a non-linear relationship between fishing
   activities and indicators of resilience reduction, with pixels with
   high-intensity fishing activities being more susceptible to resilience
   reduction. Fishing regulations are urgently needed in areas where marine
   ecosystem resilience may be reducing. Effective management and
   protection of marine ecosystems require assessment of the spatial
   overlap between marine ecosystems states and human activities. This
   study provides a scientific basis for sustainable management of
   social-ecological systems by comparing high-precision fishing data to
   marine environmental data, thereby analysing marine ecosystem resilience
   through the use of early warning indicators.},

   Learning Perspective},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {Climate change is acting to reallocate biomes, shift the distribution of
   species, and alter community assemblages in Alaska. Predictions
   regarding how these changes will affect the biodiversity and
   interspecific relationships of small mammals are necessary to
   pro-actively inform conservation planning. We used a set of online
   occurrence records and machine learning methods to create bioclimatic
   envelope models for 17 species of small mammals (rodents and shrews)
   across Alaska. Models formed the basis for sets of species-specific
   distribution maps for 2010 and were projected forward using the IPCC
   (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) A2 scenario to predict
   distributions of the same species for 2100. We found that distributions
   of cold-climate, northern, and interior small mammal species experienced
   large decreases in area while shifting northward, upward in elevation,
   and inland across the state. In contrast, many southern and continental
   species expanded throughout Alaska, and also moved down-slope and toward
   the coast. Statewide community assemblages remained constant for 15 of
   the 17 species, but distributional shifts resulted in novel species
   assemblages in several regions. Overall biodiversity patterns were
   similar for both time frames, but followed general species distribution
   movement trends. Biodiversity losses occurred in the Yukon-Kuskokwim
   Delta and Seward Peninsula while the Beaufort Coastal Plain and western
   Brooks Range experienced modest gains in species richness as
   distributions shifted to form novel assemblages. Quantitative species
   distribution and biodiversity change projections should help land
   managers to develop adaptive strategies for conserving dispersal
   corridors, small mammal biodiversity, and ecosystem functionality into
   the future.},

Abstract = {Drybeans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are an important subsistence crop in
   Central America. Future climate change may threaten drybean production
   and jeopardize smallholder farmers' food security. We estimated yield
   changes in drybeans due to changing climate in these countries using
   downscaled data from global circulation models (GCMs) in El Salvador,
   Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. We generated daily weather data,
   which we used in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer
   (DSSAT) drybean submodel. We compared different cultivars, soils, and
   fertilizer options in three planting seasons. We analyzed the simulated
   yields to spatially classify high-impact spots of climate change across
   the four countries. The results show a corridor of reduced yields from
   Lake Nicaragua to central Honduras (10-38 \% decrease). Yields increased
   in the Guatemalan highlands, towards the Atlantic coast, and in southern
   Nicaragua (10-41 \% increase). Some farmers will be able to adapt to
   climate change, but others will have to change crops, which will require
   external support. Research institutions will need to devise technologies
   that allow farmers to adapt and provide policy makers with feasible
   strategies to implement them.},

Title = {A tale of two reef systems: Local conditions, disturbances, coral life
   histories, and the climate catastrophe},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Coral reefs have evolved over millennia to survive disturbances. Yet, in
   just a few decades chronic local pressures and the climate catastrophe
   have accelerated so quickly that most coral reefs are now threatened.
   Rising ocean temperatures and recurrent bleaching pose the biggest
   threat, affecting even remote and well-managed reefs on global scales.
   We illustrate how coral bleaching is altering reefs by contrasting the
   dynamics of adjacent reef systems over more than two decades. Both reef
   systems sit near the edge of northwest Australia's continental shelf,
   have escaped chronic local pressures and are regularly affected by
   tropical storms and cyclones. The Scott reef system has experienced
   multiple bleaching events, including mass bleaching in 1998 and 2016,
   from which it is unlikely to fully recover. The Rowley Shoals has
   maintained a high cover and diversity of corals and has not yet been
   impacted by mass bleaching. We show how the dynamics of both reef
   systems were driven by a combination of local environment, exposure to
   disturbances and coral life history traits, and consider future shifts
   in community structure with ongoing climate change. We then demonstrate
   how applying knowledge of community dynamics at local scales can aid
   management strategies to slow the degradation of coral reefs until
   carbon emissions and other human impacts are properly managed.},

Abstract = {Cities, recognized as one of the roughest surfaces, significantly reduce
   wind velocity. This leads to a greater concentration of pollution and
   increased temperature in urban areas. A proper urban design may promote
   the air flow and mitigate these negative phenomena. This paper describes
   a novel approach to detect and analyze the potential urban ventilation
   corridors. The concept is based on the morphometric analyses, where
   roughness parameters (such as roughness length and displacement height),
   as well as porosity are investigated as opposed to previous studies.
   Commonly available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data enable more
   detailed terrain study, as the topography and obstacle features (type,
   dimensions, and porosity) might be investigated. In comparison to the
   previous studies and long adapted practices, this approach takes
   advantage of all information incorporated in LiDAR data to deliver even
   more accurate results. The comparison of the detected corridors, with
   the officially designed corridors in our study area in Warsaw, suggests
   inaccuracies in their extent (only 40\% of their areas might still be
   functioning) and calls for an evaluation. The results deliver areas that
   may be recognized as urban ventilation corridors and serve as air
   regeneration and ventilation system. They may also be used for
   developing new solutions for continuously evolving cities.},

   adaptation and mitigation planning},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {19-31},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper investigates climate change adaptation and mitigation
   planning responses of New Zealand communities, using an online survey of
   local elected representatives. Climate change is affecting New Zealand
   through changes in precipitation patterns, increases in temperature,
   changes to the frequency and duration of droughts, sea level rise, and
   the increased occurrence of extreme events. These impacts highlight the
   vulnerability of key economic activities, communities, and
   infrastructure. As environmental and socioeconomic vulnerability varies
   with place, local level climate change policies are important tools to
   increase resilience when faced with a changing climate. The research
   survey, targeted towards local elected representatives, unpacks local
   scale climate change planning efforts across the country, as well as
   decision-maker perceptions of barriers and motivations in the area of
   climate change planning. Findings suggest that increasing local-scale
   responses hinges on public perception of the urgency of climate change,
   which is heavily influenced by national priorities. Furthermore, support
   for national level responses is limited by a collective view of climate
   change as an issue of an uncertain future, rather than one of present
   concern. Thus, the inclination to act at the local level is to some
   extent undermined by slow national action.},

Title = {Large-scale shift in the structure of a kelp forest ecosystem co-occurs
   with an epizootic and marine heatwave},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Climate change is responsible for increased frequency, intensity, and
   duration of extreme events, such as marine heatwaves (MHWs). Within
   eastern boundary current systems, MHWs have profound impacts on
   temperature-nutrient dynamics that drive primary productivity. Bull kelp
   (Nereocystis luetkeana) forests, a vital nearshore habitat, experienced
   unprecedented losses along 350km of coastline in northern California
   beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2019. These losses have had
   devastating consequences to northern California communities, economies,
   and fisheries. Using a suite of in situ and satellite-derived data, we
   demonstrate that the abrupt ecosystem shift initiated by a multi-year
   MHW was preceded by declines in keystone predator population densities.
   We show strong evidence that northern California kelp forests, while
   temporally dynamic, were historically resilient to fluctuating
   environmental conditions, even in the absence of key top predators, but
   that a series of coupled environmental and biological shifts between
   2014 and 2016 resulted in the formation of a persistent, altered
   ecosystem state with low primary productivity. Based on our findings, we
   recommend the implementation of ecosystem-based and adaptive management
   strategies, such as (1) monitoring the status of key ecosystem
   attributes: kelp distribution and abundance, and densities of sea
   urchins and their predators, (2) developing management responses to
   threshold levels of these attributes, and (3) creating quantitative
   restoration suitability indices for informing kelp restoration efforts.
   Meredith McPherson et al. use a 34-year time series of satellite and in
   situ derived data to study bull kelp forests of northern California and
   demonstrate the ecosystem shifts following a marine heatwave event
   between 2014 and 2016. The results show that increased herbivory by sea
   urchins due to the loss of a predator reduced bull kelp forest
   resistance to fluctuating environmental conditions and point to the
   importance of ecosystem-based and adaptive management strategies.},

Abstract = {A new regional climate projection ensemble has been created for the
   Australasia region as part of the World Climate Research Programs
   Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The
   CORDEX-Australasia ensemble is the largest regional climate projection
   ensemble ever created for the region. It is a 20-member ensemble made by
   6 regional climate models downscaling 11 global climate models. Overall
   the ensemble produces a good representation of recent climate.
   Consistent biases within the ensemble include an underestimation of the
   diurnal temperature range and an underestimation of precipitation across
   much of southern Australia. Under a high emissions scenario projected
   temperature changes by the end of the twenty-first century reach similar
   to 5 K in the interior of Australia with smaller increases found toward
   the coast. Projected precipitation changes are towards drying,
   particularly in the most populated areas of the southwest and southeast
   of the continent. The projected precipitation change is very seasonal
   with summer projected to see little change leaning toward an increase.
   These results provide a foundation enabling future studies of regional
   climate changes, climate change impacts, and adaptation options for
   Australia.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture is replacing capture fisheries in supplying the world with
   dietary protein. Although disease is a major threat to aquaculture
   production, the underlying global epidemiological patterns are unknown.
   We analysed disease outbreak severity across different latitudes in a
   diverse range of aquaculture systems. Disease at lower latitudes
   progresses more rapidly and results in higher cumulative mortality, in
   particular at early stages of development and in shellfish. Tropical
   countries suffer proportionally greater losses in aquaculture during
   disease outbreaks and have less time to mitigate losses. Synthesis and
   applications. Disease can present a major problem for food production
   and security in equatorial regions where fish and shellfish provide a
   major source of dietary protein. As the incidences of some infectious
   diseases may increase with climate change, adaptation strategies must
   consider global patterns in disease vulnerability of aquaculture and
   develop options to minimize impacts on food production.},

Title = {Building Coral Reef Resilience Through Spatial Herbivore Management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {Coral reef managers currently face the challenge of mitigating global
   stressors by enhancing local ecological resilience in a changing
   climate. Effective herbivore management is one tool that managers can
   use in order to maintain resilience in the midst of severe and frequent
   bleaching events. One recommended approach is to establish networks of
   herbivore management areas (HMAs), which prohibit the take of
   herbivorous reef fishes. However, there is a need to develop design
   principles to guide planning and implementation of these HMAs as a
   resilience-building tool. We refine available guidance from fully
   protected marine protected area (MPA) networks and developed a set of 11
   biophysical design principles specifically for HMAs. We then provide a
   case study of how to apply these principles using the main Hawaiian
   Islands. We address site-specific considerations in terms of protecting
   habitats, including ecologically critical areas, incorporating
   connectivity, and addressing climate and local threats. This synthesis
   integrates core marine spatial planning concepts with resilience-based
   management and provides actionable guidance on the design of HMAs. When
   combined with social considerations, these principles will support
   spatial planning in Hawaii and could guide the future design of HMA
   networks globally.},

   Mytilus galloprovincialis},
Journal = {ISCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Predicting the potential for species adaption to climate change is
   challenged by the need to identify the physiological mechanisms that
   underpin species vulnerability. Here, we investigated the sensitivity to
   ocean acidification in marine mussels during early development, and
   specifically the trochophore stage. Using RNA and DNA sequencing and in
   situ RNA hybridization, we identified developmental processes associated
   with abnormal development and rapid adaptation to low pH. Trochophores
   exposed to low pH seawater exhibited 43 differentially expressed genes.
   Gene annotation and in situ hybridization of differentially expressed
   genes point to pH sensitivity of (1) shell field development and (2)
   cellular stress response. Five genes within these two processes
   exhibited shifts in allele frequencies indicative of a potential for
   rapid adaptation. This case study contributes direct evidence that
   protecting species' existing genetic diversity is a critical management
   action to facilitate species resilience to climate change.},

Title = {Modelling the interference of underground structures with groundwater
   flow and remedial solutions in Milan},
Journal = {ENGINEERING GEOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {272},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Underground structures and infrastructures within urban areas cause
   disturbance to the groundwater flow. Groundwater abstraction in Milan
   decreased of more than 30\% since the 1970s generating a groundwater
   rebound which caused submergence and flooding of multiple underground
   structures and infrastructures. In order to evaluate the impact of
   underground structures on the groundwater flow in the Milan city area, a
   detailed analysis based on a groundwater flow model was carried out. The
   3D FEM groundwater flow model was calibrated against high resolution
   monitoring data and used to evaluate both the disturbance induced by
   underground structures and their sequence of construction, and to verify
   the performance of mitigation strategies. Major modifications of
   groundwater head distribution are observed when structures transversally
   cut the groundwater flow, resulting in the fragmentation of the
   groundwater flow pathways and leading to changes in groundwater head
   from about +/- 0.05 m, at a regional scale, to about +/- 0.45 in
   relative proximity (few hundred metres) of underground structures. The
   effectiveness of a traditional-grey (i.e. a drainage tunnel) and a
   blue-green infrastructure (i.e. water extraction wells combined with
   heat pump systems) mitigation scenarios is discussed. Blue-green
   infrastructures result the most effective and efficient mitigation
   solutions with direct impact on sustainability and environmental
   conditions.},

Title = {Assessing barriers to adaptation to climate change in coastal Tanzania:
   Does where you live matter?},
Journal = {POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {231-263},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research on barriers to climate change adaptation has, hitherto,
   disproportionately focused on institutional barriers. Despite the
   critical importance of personal barriers in shaping the adaptive
   response of humanity to climate change and variability, the literature
   on the subject is rather nascent. This study is premised on the
   hypothesis that place-specific characteristics (where you live) and
   compositional (both biosocial and sociocultural) factors may be salient
   to differentials in adaptation to climate change in coastal areas of
   developing countries. This is because adaptation to climate change is
   inherently local. Using cross-sectional survey data on 1,253 individuals
   (606 males and 647 females), barriers to adaptation to climate change
   were observed to vary with place, indicating that there is inequality in
   barriers to adaptation. In the multivariate models, the place-specific
   differences in barriers to adaptation were robust and remained
   statistically significant even when socio-demographic (compositional)
   variables were controlled. Observed differences in barriers to
   adaptation to climate change in coastal Tanzania mainly reflect strong
   place-specific disparities among groups indicating the need for
   adaptation policies that are responsive to processes of
   socio-institutional learning in a specific context, involving multiple
   people that have a stake in the present and the future of that place.
   These people are making complex, multifaceted choices about managing and
   adapting to climate-related risks and opportunities, often in the face
   of resource constraints and competing agendas.},

Abstract = {Coastal risk reduction strategies world-wide face multiple challenges:
   rising sea-levels, more frequent flooding, greater exposure and
   increasingly threatened natural coastal habitats. Over the last three to
   four decades, a body of evidence has been growing that indicates that
   coastal habitats can be managed alongside artificial defences to reduce
   the risk of flooding. Many countries are moving towards approaches that
   use more natural and nature-based approaches for risk reduction. If
   executed effectively, such approaches can serve to conserve natural
   habitats, reduce risk from low-magnitude flood events and storms, and
   reduce exposure. Wide-spread implementation of such approaches remains
   absent due, in part, to uncertainty around the appropriate engineering,
   economic, habitat management and policy measures. The ``Science for
   Nature and People{''} (SNAP) Coastal Defenses project is a global
   collaboration of researchers from engineering, ecological, economic and
   policy disciplines to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of
   habitats in coastal risk reduction and provide guidelines to inform
   their appropriate use. This paper presents initial results from a
   systematic global review of the wave attenuation function of coastal
   habitats. The synthesis focuses on wave reduction by coastal habitats
   and reviews 68 field and field-based studies across mangroves, marshes,
   reefs and wetlands. An online, interactive database of examples of the
   use and effectiveness of natural habitats in risk reduction is also
   presented.},

Title = {Defining Coral Bleaching as a Microbial Dysbiosis within the Coral
   Holobiont},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coral microbiomes are critical to holobiont health and functioning, but
   the stability of host-microbial interactions is fragile, easily shifting
   from eubiosis to dysbiosis. The heat-induced breakdown of the symbiosis
   between the host and its dinoflagellate algae (that is,
   ``bleaching{''}), is one of the most devastating outcomes for reef
   ecosystems. Yet, bleaching tolerance has been observed in some coral
   species. This review provides an overview of the holobiont's diversity,
   explores coral thermal tolerance in relation to their associated
   microorganisms, discusses the hypothesis of adaptive dysbiosis as a
   mechanism of environmental adaptation, mentions potential solutions to
   mitigate bleaching, and suggests new research avenues. More
   specifically, we define coral bleaching as the succession of three
   holobiont stages, where the microbiota can (i) maintain essential
   functions for holobiont homeostasis during stress and/or (ii) act as a
   buffer to mitigate bleaching by favoring the recruitment of thermally
   tolerant Symbiodiniaceae species (adaptive dysbiosis), and where (iii)
   environmental stressors exceed the buffering capacity of both microbial
   and dinoflagellate partners leading to coral death.},

Title = {Using the systemic-resilience thinking approach to enhance participatory

Abstract = {Community participation is at the heart of environmental governance as
   it facilitates and promotes a sense of ownership in a society's decision
   making and social development issues. This paper, using both primary and
   secondary data collected through methods inspired by participatory
   research, set out to discuss a methodological approach aimed at
   understanding how common pool natural resources are managed by
   multi-actors and stakeholders in a developing country context in an
   effort to promote inclusive land reform-led outdoor tourism. It combines
   two `soft-systems' schools of thought, systemic thinking and resilience
   thinking, to analyse the effectiveness and efficiency of collaborative
   management of natural resources in tribal communities established
   through land reform processes in South Africa. It is argued in the paper
   that the two schools of thought can play key roles in identifying and
   informing the development of appropriate intervening measures and
   strategies that can contribute towards the adoption of effective and
   sustainable systems of community natural resource management and bring
   about more meaningful community development through community-based
   tourism. These observations have been made within the broader and
   contemporary arguments of sustainable environmental management and
   community development.
   Management implications:
   The systemic-resilience approach appears to be critical for increasing
   stakeholder participation in conservation endeavours aimed at outdoor
   recreational activities and tourism.
   The intervention approach in complex tribal communities is key for
   establishing accommodations that will enable developing action plans to
   enhance stakeholder participation in co-managing common pool natural
   resources earmarked for community-based ecotourism.
   The systemic-resilience approach promotes strong and genuine
   grassroot-grown community participation in environmental management
   decision making, thereby promoting stakeholder participation of
   interested actors in outdoor recreation and tourism.
   Systemic-resilience facilitates the attainment of social capital
   elements which are key to the successful co-management of natural
   resources, i.e. participation, transparency, reciprocity and effective
   communication.},

Title = {The complex relationship between asset wealth, adaptation, and
   diversification in tropical fisheries},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Marine small-scale fisheries are complex social and ecological systems
   that are currently pressurised by climate change, increasing demand for
   food, and expectation to sustain livelihoods. Species diversification
   and occupational diversification are often offered as adaptation
   strategies to increase the resilience of these fisheries to natural and
   economic shocks. However, little is known about the nature of species
   diversification within marine tropical fisheries. Based on 293
   interviews with artisanal fishers from six coastal communities located
   at the isles of Zanzibar, Pemba, Mafia, and Mainland Tanga in Tanzania -
   we assess if fishers with the highest level of species diversification
   are the most financially secure and able to adapt to changes in the
   fishing industry. By creating an Asset Wealth Index (AWI) based on a
   Multiple Correspondence Approach (MCA), we investigate the relative
   levels of adaptive capacity and fishery connectivity within the
   different regional wealth quartiles. We find that less wealthy fishers
   target fewer species, making them less able to absorb changes in
   management measures focused on species, area, and closures. Likewise,
   fishers with higher wealth scores and higher adaptive capacity are able
   to better absorb the short-term losses of fisheries closures when
   compared to those with lower wealth and adaptive scores reliant on
   higher levels of fishery connectivity.},

Title = {Overfishing reduces resilience of kelp beds to climate-driven

Abstract = {A key consideration in assessing impacts of climate change is the
   possibility of synergistic effects with other human-induced stressors.
   In the ocean realm, climate change and overfishing pose two of the
   greatest challenges to the structure and functioning of marine
   ecosystems. In eastern Tasmania, temperate coastal waters are warming at
   approximately four times the global ocean warming average, representing
   the fastest rate of warming in the Southern Hemisphere. This has driven
   range extension of the ecologically important long-spined sea urchin
   (Centrostephanus rodgersii), which has now commenced catastrophic
   overgrazing of productive Tasmanian kelp beds leading to loss of
   biodiversity and important rocky reef ecosystem services. Coincident
   with the overgrazing is heavy fishing of reef-based predators including
   the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii. By conducting experiments inside and
   outside Marine Protected Areas we show that fishing, by removing large
   predatory lobsters, has reduced the resilience of kelp beds against the
   climate-driven threat of the sea urchin and thus increased risk of
   catastrophic shift to widespread sea urchin barrens. This shows that
   interactions between multiple human-induced stressors can exacerbate
   nonlinear responses of ecosystems to climate change and limit the
   adaptive capacity of these systems. Management actions focused on
   reducing the risk of catastrophic phase shift in ecosystems are
   particularly urgent in the face of ongoing warming and unprecedented
   levels of predator removal from the world's oceans.},

Title = {Evaluating drivers of coastal relocation in Hurricane Sandy affected
   communities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {215-228},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The future viability of some coastal communities has been severely
   challenged by the recent major disasters, as well as other episodic and
   chronic coastal hazards. These events also instigated a dialogue on
   their long-term resilience, adaptation options, and the possibility of
   permanent relocation From high risk areas. Little is known how exposure
   to disaster, in combination with other contemporary coastal challenges,
   affects willingness to consider relocation on a household level in the
   highly-developed urban settlements. The main objective of this paper is
   to provide a bottom-up perspective on this dilemma via identification of
   demographic determinants and other disaster-related concerns that may
   influence support for relocation. More specifically, this study takes an
   interdisciplinary approach to examine the effects of pre-disaster
   socio-economic household characteristics, level of preparedness,
   disaster exposure, experience with recovery, community embeddedness, and
   resource loss on relocation decision making. The findings hereby reveal
   that the willingness to consider relocation is primarily influenced by
   the age of respondents, disaster exposure, level of experienced stress
   related to recovery, personal financial recovery concerns, future cost
   of living in high-risk area, concerns with increase in crime and future
   flooding, and disasterinduced resource loss. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Adaptive governance and the human dimensions of marine mammal
   management: Implications for policy in a changing North},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {466-476},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As climate change has driven dramatic changes in Northern sea ice
   regimes, marine mammals have gained iconic status around the world
   reflecting the perils of global warming. There is a tension between
   policies that have international support like a ban on seal hunting or
   whaling, and the adoption of adaptive, flexible rules that are likely to
   work in Northern places. Whereas most wildlife policy focuses on
   biological information to inform policy strategy, this analysis focuses
   on the ``human dimensions{''} of Northern marine mammal management. This
   research examines ways in which human relationships and modes of
   governance affect conservation success. Standard analyses of risk to
   animal populations focused on direct sources of take are inadequate to
   address multi-causal, complex problems such as climate-induced habitat
   loss or increased industrialization of the Arctic Ocean. Early
   conservation policy strategies focusing on the moratorium of take have
   eliminated or reduced such practices as commercialized hunting and high
   levels of fisheries bycatch, but may be less relevant in an era in which
   habitats and climate changes are key drivers of population dynamics.
   This paper argues that effective adaptive policy requires new ways of
   learning about and governing human interactions with marine mammals.
   Through an exploration of marine mammal management in three Northern
   regions (Alaska, Nunavut, and the Finnish Baltic Sea coast), the paper
   analyzes the extent to which these marine mammal management regimes are
   practicing adaptive governance, that is, building cross-scale (local to
   international) understanding while allowing actors at the local scale
   the flexibility to direct the creation of rules that are ecologically
   robust and likely to succeed. Lessons are taken from these examples and
   used to propose selected policy and research recommendations for the
   marine mammal policy community. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Geospatiality of climate change perceptions on coastal regions: A
   systematic bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},

Abstract = {Climate change requires joint actions between government and local
   actors. Understanding the perception of people and communities is
   critical for designing climate change adaptation strategies. Those most
   affected by climate change are populations in coastal regions that face
   extreme weather events and sea-level increases. In this article,
   geospatial perception of climate change is identified, and the research
   parameters are quantified. In addition to investigating the correlations
   of hotspots on the topic of climate change perception with a focus on
   coastal communities, Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to
   examine the research interactions. A total of 27,138 articles sources
   from Google Scholar and Scopus were analyzed. A systematic method was
   used for data processing combining bibliometric analysis and machine
   learning. Publication trends were analyzed in English, Spanish and
   Portuguese. Publications in English (87\%) were selected for network and
   data mining analysis. Most of the research was conducted in the USA,
   followed by India and China. The main research methods were identified
   through correlation networks. In many cases, social studies of
   perception are related to climatic methods and vegetation analysis
   supported by GIS. The analysis of keywords identified ten research
   topics: adaptation, risk, community, local, impact, livelihood, farmer,
   household, strategy, and variability. ``Adaptation{''} is in the core of
   the correlation network of all keywords. The interdisciplinary analysis
   between social and environmental factors, suggest improvements are
   needed for research in this field. A single method cannot address
   understanding of a phenomenon as complicated as the socio-environmental.
   This study provides valuable information for future research by
   clarifying the current context of perception work carried out in the
   coastal regions; and identifying the tools best suited for carrying out
   this type of research.},

Title = {Towards sustainable management of kelp forests: An analysis of adaptive
   governance in developing regimes for wild kelp harvesting in Scotland
   and Norway},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Kelp forests are highly productive habitats which support important
   marine species and ecosystem services including coastal protection and
   carbon storage. Demand is increasing for commercial products from wild
   and cultivated kelp, however questions remain on how harvesting of wild
   kelp can be managed and governed in a sustainable and adaptive way. This
   paper analyses and contrasts the institutional arrangements for wild
   kelp harvesting in Scotland and Norway by examining three recent
   governance processes through document analysis and participant
   observation. We investigate to what extent the regimes display three
   foundational aspects of adaptive governance: local governance and
   participation; the use of knowledge; and legal adaptive capacity.
   Industrial harvesting has been underway for decades in Norway but is not
   yet practiced in Scotland, although kelp availability and traditional
   usage are similar. In Scotland, following extensive public objection in
   response to proposed industrial harvesting, a legal restriction was
   adopted in 2019 that prohibits industrial harvesting of whole plants,
   and the regulatory regime remains under review. In Norway, governance of
   kelp harvesting is designed to be adaptive and inclusive through
   periodic review of regional harvesting regulations, yet has not been
   adjusted despite contestation from stakeholders. In both cases, adaptive
   governance processes are indicated but are not influential on outcomes.
   Our paper reveals several obstacles to knowledge-based adaptive
   governance in practice. First, it is insufficient to create the
   processes of engagement and participation - these must be empowered to
   influence governance and remain legitimate. In both cases, the regimes
   remain hierarchical and dominated by central agencies, even though
   structures for local governance are available. Second, integrating
   scientific and local knowledge was shown to be difficult, and mechanisms
   to debate and negotiate risks and benefits were lacking. In each case,
   diverging perspectives on kelp harvesting were sustained even though
   final outcomes were reached, and consensus was elusive. Third, adaptive
   capacity of applicable legal instruments is of crucial importance, with
   differences apparent in capacity to enable on-going revision (as in
   Norway) and limit future change (in Scotland). Poor co-ordination
   between legal instruments also leads to complications between actors
   with different mandates and policy objectives. Recommendations are made
   for an adaptive approach to protect and manage kelp as a critical
   habitat.},

Title = {Climate change and the future for coral reef fishes},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {261-285},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change will impact coral-reef fishes through effects on
   individual performance, trophic linkages, recruitment dynamics,
   population connectivity and other ecosystem processes. The most
   immediate impacts will be a loss of diversity and changes to fish
   community composition as a result of coral bleaching. Coral-dependent
   fishes suffer the most rapid population declines as coral is lost;
   however, many other species will exhibit long-term declines due to loss
   of settlement habitat and erosion of habitat structural complexity.
   Increased ocean temperature will affect the physiological performance
   and behaviour of coral reef fishes, especially during their early life
   history. Small temperature increases might favour larval development,
   but this could be counteracted by negative effects on adult
   reproduction. Already variable recruitment will become even more
   unpredictable. This will make optimal harvest strategies for coral reef
   fisheries more difficult to determine and populations more susceptible
   to overfishing. A substantial number of species could exhibit range
   shifts, with implications for extinction risk of small-range species
   near the margins of reef development. There are critical gaps in our
   knowledge of how climate change will affect tropical marine fishes.
   Predictions are often based on temperate examples, which may be
   inappropriate for tropical species. Improved projections of how ocean
   currents and primary productivity will change are needed to better
   predict how reef fish population dynamics and connectivity patterns will
   change. Finally, the potential for adaptation to climate change needs
   more attention. Many coral reef fishes have geographical ranges spanning
   a wide temperature gradient and some have short generation times. These
   characteristics are conducive to acclimation or local adaptation to
   climate change and provide hope that the more resilient species will
   persist if immediate action is taken to stabilize Earth's climate.},

Title = {The ecosystem resilience approach to control the invasive alien species
   Australian swamp stonecrop (Crassula helmsii)},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {The invasive Australian swamp stonecrop (Crassula helmsii) threatens
   species characteristic of shallow soft water lakes and pools, among
   others, in Europe. Anthropogenic disturbances, including restoration
   actions, of these ecosystems cause open niches in their littoral zones
   and allow C. helmsii to form dominant stands, especially under nutrient
   enrichment. Eradication of this invasive alien, amphibious, and clonal
   plant is, however, difficult and costly once a large population has
   established. For this reason, we here explore an ecosystem resilience
   approach (ERA) to control this invasive alien species. This approach
   includes suppressing the species by facilitating the occurrence and
   expansion of native vegetation. This requires a setback of C. helmsii's
   abundance by actively reducing its biomass, and the rehabilitation of
   optimal environmental conditions for native species. Our ERA study in
   four nature areas reveals that the introduction of native species makes
   the ecosystem more resilient against alien invasions, as shown by a
   lower abundance of this invasive plant species. Therefore, we state that
   ERA can effectively be applied in practice to decrease the invasibility
   of ecosystems by C. helmsii. Effectiveness, costs and benefits, and
   recommendations for application in practice are discussed. Overall, we
   argue that incorporating ERA in nature and water management will provide
   sustainable solutions in terms of biodiversity as well as more
   cost-effective applications for invasive alien species prevention and
   control.},

Title = {The maintenance of prefabricated green roofs for preserving cooling
   performance: A field measurement in the subtropical city of Hangzhou,
   China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban temperature increase is a critical problem for many cities. Green
   roofing is an approach to mitigating urban temperature increase, while
   the maintenance of the green roof for stable cooling potential has been
   less studied. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the cooling
   performance of prefabricated green roof for maintenance purposes.
   Focusing on the cooling and humidifying performance of the green roof,
   this study is to understand the influence of (i) vegetation species,
   (ii) weather condition and (iii) watering. This study was experimentally
   performed in the subtropical city of Hangzhou, China in the summer
   season, with three local vegetation species including Pomegranate,
   Bermuda grass and Sedum lineare. Results indicate that under sunny
   conditions, the Pomegranate roof was favourable with the best diurnal
   cooling and humidifying effects, the Bermuda grass roof could be
   acceptable while the Sedum lineare roof is not suggested. In comparison,
   all green roofs could maintain diurnal cooling and humidifying effects
   under cloudy conditions. Watering is critical to green roof cooling and
   humidifying effects. Without watering, all green roofs could elevate air
   temperature and dry surrounding environment and could die. The
   Pomegranate should be watered before 15:00 under sunny condition, while
   both Bermuda grass and Sedum lineare roofs should be watered before
   noon. Moreover, nocturnal watering makes slight differences to green
   roof cooling and humidifying effects. Overall, this study helps
   understand the green roof cooling and humidifying effects and it can
   instruct green roof management and maintenance.},

Title = {Evaluation and promotion strategy of resilience of urban water supply
   system under flood and drought disasters},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {With global climate change and the rapid urbanization, urban flood and
   drought disasters are frequent and urban water supply systems are facing
   a sea of serious challenges. It is crucial to assess the resilience of
   urban water supply systems and develop corresponding disaster mitigation
   and improvement strategies. Urban water supply systems include many
   subsystems, but existing researches generally focus on a single
   subsystem. Therefore, this paper proposes a correlation analysis method
   and a factor analysis method for the resilience evaluation index system
   of urban water supply systems by combining each subsystem and applying
   grey system theory. The method can reflect the four dimensions of the
   water supply process (water source, water plant, supply and distribution
   network and users) and the five dimensions of the urban management
   system (society, natural environment, economy, physics and
   organization). Taking Qingdao as an example, a multi-level integrated
   evaluation model based on a cloud model is applied to simulate and
   analyze the resilience of Qingdao's water supply system. As a result,
   decision support is provided for planning and building resilience
   systems for urban water systems in the short and long term, based on
   four main factors.},

Abstract = {Achieving good performance with a parallel genetic algorithm requires
   properly configuring control parameters such as mutation rate, crossover
   rate, and population size. We consider the problem of setting control
   parameter values in a standard, island-model distributed genetic
   algorithm. As an alternative to tuning parameters by hand or using a
   self-adaptive approach, we propose a very simple strategy which
   statically assigns random control parameter values to each processor.
   Experiments on benchmark problems show that this simple approach can
   yield results which are competitive with homogeneous distributed genetic
   algorithm using parameters tuned specifically for each of the
   benchmarks.},

Title = {Early Warning Systems: Lost in Translation or Late by Definition? A
   FORIN Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-331},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Early warning systems (EWSs) are widely considered to be one of the most
   important mechanisms to prevent disasters around the globe. But as
   disasters continue to affect countries where EWSs have already been
   implemented, the striking disaster consequences have led us to reflect
   on the focus, architecture, and function of the warning systems. Since
   the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami there has been a rapid rise in the
   promotion and use of EWSs to minimize disaster losses and damage.
   However, few researchers have addressed the question of their
   acceptability as an adaptive measure to the existing exposure
   conditions. EWSs are far more linked to emergency response and
   humanitarian crises and accepted technological interventions as
   solutions than they are to explicitly advance integrated analysis,
   disaster risk reduction, and policy making. A major flaw of EWSs is that
   the term ``early{''} has been essentially used in reference to the speed
   of hazard onset, founded on a physicalist perspective that has
   encouraged a considerable dependence on technology. In this article we
   address the need for a clear understanding of the root causes and risk
   drivers of disaster risk creation, as advanced in the FORIN (forensic
   investigation of disasters) approach, as a prerequisite for the
   development of more articulated EWSs that could contribute to disaster
   risk reduction through policy making and practice, based on integrated
   and transdisciplinary management, in the interest of sustainable
   development, and human welfare and well-being.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {The climate change focus in Australia has shifted from mitigation to
   adaptation with an emphasis on place-specific case studies. The Barwon
   Estuary Complex (BEC) on the Bellarine Peninsula, central Victoria, was
   the focus of this place-specific study in which 37 local stakeholders
   were consulted through a series of semi-structured interviews on the
   impacts of climate change on their coastal community. Overall there was
   uniformity in stakeholder perceptions of the climate change impacts and
   vulnerabilities pertaining to the BEC. In contrast, discussion on
   adaptation drew a diversity of responses. While 53 per cent of
   stakeholders indicated a need to limit the use of hard structures, and
   rather plan around a changing estuarine environment, opinion amongst the
   community group was divided. Some believed `retreat is the only option'
   whilst others felt `there won't be much leaving'. The present level of
   confusion around adaptation highlights the imperative of commencing
   discussions now to allow sufficient time to develop strategies which are
   both environmentally and socially responsible. This is important as
   ultimately it will be the community that will determine whether
   adaptation strategies are adopted or met with resistance.},

Title = {Evaluating the Potential of Landsat Satellite Data to Monitor the
   Effectiveness of Measures to Mitigate Urban Heat Islands: A Case Study
   for Stuttgart (Germany)},
Journal = {URBAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) effect is a serious health risk for people
   living in cities and thus calls for effective mitigation strategies in
   urban areas. Satellite data enable monitoring of the surface urban heat
   island (SUHI) over large areas at high spatial resolution. Here we
   analysed SUHI in the city of Stuttgart (Germany) based on land surface
   temperature (LST) data from Landsat at 30 m resolution. The overall SUHI
   in Stuttgart decreased by 1.4 degrees C between the investigated time
   periods 2004-2008 and 2016-2020, while the absolute LST increased by 2.5
   degrees C. We identified local hotspots of strong warming and cooling in
   Stuttgart through the change in SUHI and categorised them based on the
   predominant land cover change occurring at the hotspot using the
   Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat as well as
   visual information on land cover changes from Google Earth Pro. The
   establishment of green roofs, as well as albedo changes, are
   predominantly responsible for cooling spots, while warming spots are
   mostly associated with the sealing of surfaces. This highlights that
   vegetation has a dominant influence on SUHI development in Stuttgart.
   Combining satellite-based LST data with visual information thus provides
   an effective method to identify local warming and cooling hotspots,
   which allows monitoring of the success of city policies against heat
   stress and guides future policy.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variations in female size at maturity of a Southern
   Rock Lobster (Jasus edwardsii) population: A likely response to climate
   change},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {The size at which sexual maturity is reached is a key population
   parameter used to guide the setting of minimum legal size limits in
   fisheries. Understanding spatial and temporal variations in size at
   maturity is fundamental to management because the relationship between
   size at maturity and minimum legal size limits affects the fraction of
   the mature population biomass that is harvested, and resulting egg
   production, larval settlement and recruitment. This study measured the
   size at maturity of female Southern Rock Lobster (Jasus edwardsii)
   across South Australia between 1991 and 2015 in relation to known
   oceanographic characteristics, surface and subsurface temperature data,
   and relative changes in lobster abundance. There was pronounced north to
   south spatial variation in estimates of size at maturity. Larger average
   size at maturity was recorded in warmer north-western areas of the
   fishery relative to the cooler waters of the south-east. Estimates of
   size at maturity also differed over 25 years across the fishery.
   However, the nature of temporal responses varied spatially, and were
   more consistent with variations in surface and subsurface water
   temperature at local-scales than changes in lobster density. In the
   well-mixed waters of the northwestern, western and south-eastern parts
   of the fishery, relatively high rates of increase in sea-surface
   temperature and size at maturity were recorded since 1991, indicating
   that size at maturity may be responding to ocean warming associated with
   global climate change. In more central parts of the fishery, contrasting
   temporal signals in sea-surface temperature (positive) and bottom
   temperature (negative) indicated increases in upwelling strength over
   the study period, and formation of a bottom cold pool below a warm
   surface layer, with corresponding decreases in size at maturity
   recorded. The spatio-temporal changes in size at maturity measured in
   this study highlight the need for oceanographic information to be
   integrated into future stock assessment models to enhance harvest
   strategy development, allow timely adaptive management decisions and
   increase the resilience of fisheries to the impacts of climate change.},

Title = {Global warming may lower thermal barriers against invasive species in
   freshwater ecosystems - A study from Lake Constance},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {645},
Pages = {44-50},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {European freshwater ecosystems are increasingly invaded by exotic animal
   and plant species. Apart from increased connectivity between previously
   separated watersheds, the increasing temperature of the hydrosystems
   favors the spread of exotic species. The freshwater fauna of Central
   Europe is still shaped by the cold-adapted animal assemblages resulting
   from the last glaciation. It is less diverse, and the species are
   putatively less performant competitors, compared to the warm-adapted,
   species-rich fauna of the Ponto-Caspian realm, from which many current
   aquatic invaders are coming. Our study analyses potential mechanisms
   explaining the coexistence between one of the most impacting aquatic
   invaders of the past decades, the `killer shrimp' Dikerogammarus
   villosus and the previously dominating amphipod Gammarus roeselii in
   Lake Constance, using laboratory predation experiments and field
   surveys. Our results indicate two key drivers for coexistence: low
   winter temperatures and the substrate structure of the alga Chara sp. At
   temperatures below 6 degrees C, the predation pressure on G. roeselii
   was strongly reduced; G. roeselii can therefore disperse throughout the
   littoral in winter, avoiding predation by D. villosus. Artificial
   heating of a section of the lake shore, however, resulted in local
   extinction of G. roeselii by D. villosus. The macroalga Chara sp.
   completely inhibited predation by D. villosus on G. roeselii. Climate
   change scenarios indicate that global warming might destroy this thermal
   refuge during winter until 2085. For the survival of G. roeselii it will
   then be crucial, which part of the Chara population will maintain
   epigeic plant parts during winter. The complex interplay between thermal
   and physical refuges for native species in the context of climate change
   and changing trophic status of freshwater systems, as disentangled by
   our study, shows that ecosystem management and restoration strategies
   need to better consider multiple stressors (and their rather complex
   mitigation strategies). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   be described as preliminary or groundwork, with a particular focus on
   documenting stakeholder perspectives on climate change and attitudes
   towards adaptation, and modelling or scenario planning in the coastal
   zone, agriculture, and health sectors. Where concrete adaptations are
   reported, they are usually in the agricultural sector and are most
   common in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia's food basket. The
   findings of the review advance our understanding of adaptation to
   climate change as a process and the need to consider different stages in
   the process when tracking adaptation.},

Title = {Assessment on the vulnerability of Korean aquaculture to climate change},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {111-122},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We assess the vulnerability to climate change of Korean aquaculture
   based on predicted changes in seawater temperature and salinity in
   adjacent sea areas of the Korean Peninsula according to representative
   concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. Unlike previous studies that
   have been conducted mostly on a national scale, we classify 14 farming
   species in major production regions of the Republic of Korea, and assess
   their vulnerability for each region, using the indicator-based method
   and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's definition of
   vulnerability in order to overcome limitations in developing specific
   adaptation strategies within a country. First, for each exposure,
   sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, specific and proper indicators are
   selected. Subsequently, these indicators are estimated and weighted to
   analyze vulnerability to climate change. The results show that the
   absolute level of vulnerability is high in a long-term period of RCP8.5
   in which exposure becomes severe, whereas the relative vulnerability is
   similar among farming species and regions. Specifically, vulnerability
   is at the highest level in seaweed, such as laver and sea mustard, while
   fish, shrimp, and abalone are relatively less vulnerable to climate
   change.},

Title = {The race for space: Modelling the landward migration of coastal wetlands
   under sea level rise at regional scale},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {859},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Globally, sea-level rise (SLR) is a major environmental challenge for
   coastal ecosystems. Of particular concern are the impacts on intertidal
   wetlands, the loss of which would have detrimental consequences for both
   human and ecological communities. On the south-east Australian coast,
   case studies suggest that the future of intertidal wetlands will greatly
   depend on landward migration as surface accretion may not keep up with
   the predicted SLR in many estuaries. However, due to differences in
   geomorphological settings and land-use, estuaries vary in their capacity
   to accommodate lateral migration. Regional scale assessment of the
   lateral accommodation space is therefore critical for pre-emptive
   planning to conserve these valuable coastal ecosystems. In this study,
   we analysed wetland lateral accommodation space distribution within 110
   estuaries under three SLR scenarios and three land management options on
   the New South Wales coast, south-east Australia. From the wetland
   distribution predictions, we calculated and mapped the lateral
   accommodation space in each estuary associated with each sea level and
   land use scenario. We further investigated the relationships between
   wetland migration capacity, intertidal hypsometry represented by
   elevation skewness, and estuary type within a Bayesian analysis
   framework. Our results showed that while a few large riverine estuaries
   dominated the state's total accommodation space, saline wetlands were at
   risk of disappearing from most intermittently closed-open estuaries if
   they cannot vertically accrete at the pace of SLR. These distinct
   responses to SLR are due to different elevation distributions.
   Furthermore, our assessment of land use adaptation options suggested
   that the promotion of landward migration without impairing other
   important ecosystems could be achieved by making low intensity land uses
   available within several riverine estuaries and barrier (open entrance)
   estuaries. Through identifying migration opportunities and barriers, the
   findings of the study could support regional scale adaptation strategies
   to ensure the sustainability of wetland-associated ecosystem goods and
   services.},

Title = {Factors Affecting Climate-Smart Agriculture Practice Adaptation of
   Farming Households in Coastal Central Vietnam: The Case of Ninh Thuan
   Province},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Agriculture is a sector with a long tradition and an important
   contribution to economic growth in Vietnam, providing food security and
   generating revenue for the country's exports. However, agricultural
   activities in Vietnam are significantly affected by climate change. In
   Vietnam, the central coastal area in general and Ninh Thuan province in
   particular are the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. In that
   context, climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a good strategy to help
   local famers coping with climate change while securing food security.
   This study has two main objectives: to assess farmers' awareness on
   disasters and to analyze factors affecting the decision to apply CSA
   practices of farming households in Ninh Thuan. The study conducted focus
   group discussion, in-depth interview and survey of 436 households in 3
   districts of Ninh Thuan to collect data. Research results showed that
   local farmers have a high awareness of natural disasters trends and
   impacts on agricultural livelihoods. Facing with disasters in the
   context of climate change, farming households have applied some models
   of CSA such as minimal tillage, intercropping, crop rotation, crop
   transformation, and the use of plant varieties. Binary logit regression
   analysis indicated that age, education level, household income,
   membership of local associations, training attendance, and support
   policies were variables significantly influencing the farmers' decision
   to apply CSA. Challenges for CSA adoption include lack of capital,
   information, technical support and land ownership institutions in
   Vietnam. The study also made recommendations to promote CSA in Vietnam,
   including reforming the legal system, strengthening agricultural
   extension services, and providing technical and capital support to
   farmers.},

Title = {Investigating the potential for saltpan restoration for the provision of

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {436-446},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Saltpans are increasingly being abandoned around the world, leading to
   the loss of ecosystem services provided by these unique semi-natural
   wetlands. The desertion of a saltpan at the Swartkops Estuary, South
   Africa has left behind a large area of desiccated hypersaline sediment
   and a sharp decrease in waterbird abundance and diversity. Here, we
   explore the potential for restoring this saltpan's wetland function
   using stormwater inflow to support multiple ecosystem services and
   improve estuary health. Stormwater will be able to flow into the saltpan
   as a passive restoration approach that can maintain the site as a
   wetland habitat. This will contribute to improving the health of a
   nationally important, yet highly degraded, estuary by retaining 758 ML
   of stormwater to achieve full capacity, containing an estimated 2908 kg
   of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and 68 kg of dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen. Additional ecosystem services such as biodiversity
   maintenance, carbon storage and societal values can be expected.
   However, this would create a novel hypersaline stormwater wetland and a
   strategic adaptive management approach will be required. Management must
   be guided by monitoring, which should comprise collection of basic
   environmental data to establish a baseline condition, and against which,
   long term changes and responses resulting from stochastic events can be
   assessed and mitigated through the use of achievable ecological
   restoration targets.},

Abstract = {The rural populations of small island developing states in the Pacific
   region are amongst the most exposed to the harsh realities of climate
   change. Forest management, tree planting, and agroforestry are some of
   the most promising strategies to build local resilience while providing
   food and income security in these remote areas. In this paper, we
   outline the contextual reasons for why deforestation and forest
   degradation continues, and provide practice-based approaches for REDD +
   to address deforestation. Our transdisciplinary methods include the
   construction of seven land use models to compare business-as-usual
   scenarios with respective REDD + strategies across Vanuatu's five REDD +
   islands, combined with a case study of Vanuatu's first REDD + project.
   Close collaboration between international researchers, local government
   officials, and Ni-Vanuatu non-governmental organizations and communities
   allowed for information sharing across epistemologies, adding local,
   place-based knowledge to scientific inquiry, responding to calls for
   more `locally led' approaches to climate adaptation in Vanuatu.},

Title = {Estimating the effect of multiple environmental stressors on coral
   bleaching and mortality},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Coral cover has been declining in recent decades due to increased
   temperatures and environmental stressors. However, the extent to which
   different stressors contribute both individually and in concert to
   bleaching and mortality is still very uncertain. We develop and use a
   novel regression approach, using non-linear parametric models that
   control for unobserved time invariant effects to estimate the effects on
   coral bleaching and mortality due to temperature, solar radiation,
   depth, hurricanes and anthropogenic stressors using historical data from
   a large bleaching event in 2005 across the Caribbean. Two separate
   models are created, one to predict coral bleaching, and the other to
   predict near-term mortality. A large ensemble of supporting data is
   assembled to control for omitted variable bias and improve fit, and a
   significant improvement in fit is observed from univariate linear
   regression based on temperature alone. The results suggest that climate
   stressors (temperature and radiation) far outweighed direct
   anthropogenic stressors (using distance from shore and nearby human
   population density as a proxy for such stressors) in driving coral
   health outcomes during the 2005 event. Indeed, temperature was found to
   play a role similar to 4 times greater in both the bleaching and
   mortality response than population density across their observed ranges.
   The empirical models tested in this study have large advantages over
   ordinary-least squares-they offer unbiased estimates for censored data,
   correct for spatial correlation, and are capable of handling more
   complex relationships between dependent and independent variables. The
   models offer a framework for preparing for future warming events and
   climate change; guiding monitoring and attribution of other bleaching
   and mortality events regionally and around the globe; and informing
   adaptive management and conservation efforts.},

   sheet (WAIS) may be much less stable than previous believed, enabling a
   rapid disintegration. Here, we present a set of probabilistic sea-level
   projections that approximates the deeply uncertain WAIS contributions.
   The projections aim to inform robust decisions by clarifying the
   sensitivity to non-trivial or controversial assumptions. We show that
   the deeply uncertain WAIS contribution can dominate other uncertainties
   within decades. These deep uncertainties call for the development of
   robust adaptive strategies. These decision-making needs, in turn,
   require mission-oriented basic science, for example about potential
   signposts and the maximum rate of WAIS-induced sea-level changes.},

Title = {A method proposal for monitoring the microclimatic change in an urban
   area},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {46},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is known that changes in urban surface characteristics lead to
   different urban climates. The surrounding environment directly affects
   thermal comfort and human behavior. In this respect, for sustainable
   urban growth, the evaluation of urbanization together with climate
   change from past to present is also important for planning.
   The main aim of the study is to propose a retrospective GIS-based change
   detection method for the monitoring of urban climate change by using
   satellite images. Two regions with a diameter of 1 km where there are
   significant constructional changes in Istanbul were selected as the
   study areas. The comparisons were made through Landsat thermal images
   during summer between the years 2007 and 2017. The function of the model
   proposed in the study was tested by evaluating whether the expected
   climatic changes could be achieved against the constructional changes
   that took place in the region. The correlations between the regions that
   get extremely hot/cold and the constructional change areas were examined
   by the bivariate method. The results showed that the correlations could
   reach up to a high level when important changes occurred in the areas.},

Title = {Characterizing mauka-to-makai connections for aquatic ecosystem
   conservation on Maui, Hawai?i},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Mauka-to-makai (mountain to sea in the Hawaiian language) hydrologic
   connectivity - commonly referred to as ridge-to-reef - directly affects
   biogeochemical processes and socioecological functions across
   terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. The supply of freshwater to
   estuarine and nearshore environments in a ridge-to-reef system supports
   the food, water, and habitats utilized by marine fauna. In addition, the
   ecosystem services derived from this land-to-sea connectivity support
   social and cultural practices (hereafter referred to as sociocultural)
   including fishing, aquaculture, wetland agriculture, religious
   ceremonies, and recreational activities. To effectively guide island
   resource management, a better understanding of the linkages from
   ridge-to-reef across natural and social usages is critical, particularly
   in the context of climate change, with anticipated increasing
   temperature and shifting precipitation patterns. The objective of this
   study was to identify spatial linkages that promote multiple and diverse
   uses, following the ridge-to-reef concept, at an island-wide scale to
   identify regions of high conservation importance for aquatic resources.
   We selected the Island of Maui as a study representative of many Pacific
   islands. Diverse datasets, including agricultural lands within
   watersheds, wetland locations, presence of stream species, indicators of
   freshwater input from streams, coral cover, nearshore fish biomass,
   sociocultural data such as fishpond locations, wetland taro cultivation,
   beach recreation use, and lastly the dynamically downscaled Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP5) future climate projections
   scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 \& 8.5) were
   used to examine the spatial linkages through hydrological connectivity
   from land to the sea. Zonation spatial planning software was used to
   prioritize areas of high management and conservation value and to help
   inform aquatic resources management. The resulting prioritized areas
   included many minimally disturbed watersheds in east Maui and western
   nearshore and coastal zones that are adjacent to diverse coral reefs.
   These results are driven by the importance of fish biomass and coral
   reef distribution as well as traditional wetland taro cultivation and
   coastal access points for recreation. These results underline the
   importance of examining ridge-to-reef systems for aquatic resource
   management and including important social and cultural values in
   resource management upon planning adaptation strategies for climate
   change. Improving our understanding of diverse natural and
   socio-cultural influences on habitat conditions and their values in
   these areas provides an opportunity to strategically plan future
   management and conservation actions.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the shaping of Bangladesh's southern coastal region,
   often framed as the most climate vulnerable place in the world, as a
   zone of climate crisis. As rising waters threaten communities inhabiting
   the low-lying coastal islands scattered across the deltaic plain, many
   within the government and donor community have identified shrimp
   aquaculture as a principal adaptation strategy. Shrimp aquaculture is
   integral to the dynamics of what I call anticipatory ruination, a
   discursive and material process of social and ecological destruction in
   anticipation of real or perceived threats. I elaborate anticipatory
   ruination as a process that both responds to and produces Bangladesh's
   climate crisis. I use this concept to explore not only the dynamics
   taking place in Bangladesh's delta region, but also the ways in which
   climate crisis is constituted more broadly.},

Title = {The geology of Dunedin, New Zealand, and the management of geological
   hazards},
Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {23-40},
Abstract = {The city of Dunedin is located on the remains of a Miocene volcanic
   eruptive centre, which is underlain by Tertiary marine sediments and
   Late Cretaceous quartz gravel, sand and clay with some coal seams. These
   in turn rest on a basement of Jurassic schist. The geology and
   topography pose a number of geological hazards that must be considered
   in urban development. These include landslide, mine subsidence, ground
   shaking amplification and liquefaction, coastal erosion and tsunami.
   A number of research, policy and planning initiatives have been
   undertaken to assess and mitigate the effects of these hazards. A
   GIS-based Hazard Information System (for a part of the city) was
   developed to assist in identifying and mitigating hazards. Under
   legislation the Dunedin City Council (DCC) is obliged to keep a register
   of known hazards. In addition, a Lifelines project has been undertaken
   to identify hazards and related risks to emergency and utility services.
   These studies may be used by asset managers to prioritise mitigation
   measures for critical facilities as well as to avoid hazards. The DCC
   district plan includes policies to gather and maintain hazard
   information, encourage research into hazards, and control activities in
   areas that might be affected by hazards. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd

Title = {Spatiotemporal Prediction of Increasing Winter Perceived Temperature
   across a Sub-Tropical City for Sustainable Planning and Climate Change
   Mitigation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Climate variability has been documented as being key to influencing
   human wellbeing across cities as it is linked to mortality and illness
   due to changes in the perceived weather cycle. Many studies have
   investigated the impact of summer temperature on human health and have
   proposed mitigation strategies for summer heat waves. However,
   sub-tropical cities are still experiencing winter temperature
   variations. Increasing winter perceived temperature through the decades
   may soon affect city wellbeing, due to a larger temperature change
   between normal winter days and extreme cold events, which may cause
   higher health risk due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness.
   Therefore, winter perceived temperature should also be considered and
   integrated in urban sustainable planning. This study has integrated the
   increasing winter perceived temperature as a factor for developing
   spatiotemporal protocols for mitigating the adverse impact of climate
   change. Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite images and
   building data extracted from aerial photographs were used to simulate
   the adjusted wind chill equivalent temperature (AWCET) particularly for
   sub-tropical scenarios between 1990 and 2010 of the Kowloon Peninsula,
   Hong Kong. Compared with perceived temperature based on the
   representative station located at the headquarters of the Hong Kong
   Observatory, the temperature of half the study area in the Kowloon
   Peninsula has raised by 1.5 degrees C. The areas with less green space
   and less public open space in 2010 show higher relative temperatures.
   Socioeconomically deprived areas (e.g., areas with lower median monthly
   income) may suffer more from this scenario, but not all types of
   socioeconomic disparities are associated with poor sustainable planning.
   Based on our results and the no-one left behind guideline from the
   United Nations, climate change mitigation should be conducted by
   targeting socioeconomic neighborhoods more than just aging communities.},

Abstract = {The resilience of cities in response to natural disasters and long-term
   climate change has emerged as a focus of academic and policy attention.
   In particular, how to understand the interconnectedness of urban and
   natural systems is a key issue. This paper introduces an urban model
   that can be used to evaluate city resilience outcomes under different
   policy scenarios. The model is the Wellington Integrated Land
   Use-Transport-Environment Model (WILUTE). It considers the city (i.e.,
   Wellington) as a complex system characterized by interactions between a
   variety of internal urban processes (social, economic and physical) and
   the natural environment. It is focused on exploring the dynamic
   relations between human activities (the geographic distribution of
   housing and employment, infrastructure layout, traffic flows and energy
   consumption), environmental effects (carbon emissions, influences on
   local natural and ecological systems) and potential natural disasters
   (e.g., inundation due to sea level rise and storm events) faced under
   different policy scenarios. The model gives insights that are
   potentially useful for policy to enhance the city's resilience, by
   modelling outcomes, such as the potential for reduction in
   transportation energy use, and changes in the vulnerability of the

Title = {US container port resilience in a complex and dynamic world},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {The resilience of US container ports is increasingly challenged by
   disruptive and stressful events such as regulatory change, adverse
   weather, larger container ship sizes, changing patterns of trade and sea
   routes, and the still to be quantified effects of enlarging the
   capabilities and capacity of the Panama Canal. Port sustainability
   requires the port managers to be resilient in their practices, to
   maintain existing performance levels and to increase market share when
   opportunity presents. The primary question that this paper addresses is
   how US container ports might be affected by adverse events and how they
   undertake resilience processes when faced with complex problems and
   uncertain outcomes. The paper gathers insights from literature on
   complex adaptive systems to discuss how US container ports may adapt to
   changing circumstances through innovation and the emergent outputs of
   self-organised agents (components) of their port organisations. The
   paper suggests that by conceptualising ports as complex adaptive
   systems, port managers may be able to better understand the complexity
   of change and organisational dynamics and thus harness the phenomenon of
   self-organisation towards their strategic intent.},

Title = {Responses of water insecure coastal communities of Tanzania to climate
   change impacts. Is it incremental or transformative adaptation?},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Pages = {745-754},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges of the
   twenty-first century that requires significant responses. Its impacts
   have already been felt and projected to cause more impacts on sectors
   essential for economic development including freshwater resources.
   Although it is becoming clear that transformative adaptation is
   indispensable as climate change impacts increase, most adaptation
   strategies have largely been envisioned to be incremental with little
   attention to transformative adaptation. To fill part of such information
   gap, this paper assessed if responses of water insecure coastal
   communities of Tanzania are incremental or transformative. Simple random
   sampling procedure was used to obtain 97 households, while purposive
   sampling procedure was used to select key informants. Quantitative data
   were subjected to descriptive statistics, whereas qualitative data were
   analysed through content analysis. Results indicated that water security
   has decreased in the past 30 years. Most response strategies used by
   people in the area are incremental, weak and undesirable for effective
   as well as successful adaptation to climate change. This study
   recommends for development practitioners and other stakeholders to help
   local people institute transformative adaptation.},

Title = {Good governance and local level policy implementation for
   disaster-risk-reduction: actual, perceptual and contested perspectives
   in coastal communities in Bangladesh},
Journal = {DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {94-111},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Purpose Despite Bangladesh's great strides in formulating disaster
   management policies following the principles of good governance, the
   degree to which these policies have successfully been implemented at the
   local level remains largely unknown. The objectives of this study were
   two-fold: (1) to examine the roles and effectiveness of local-level
   governance and disaster management institutions, and (2) to identify
   barriers to the implementation of national policies and
   Disaster-Risk-Reduction (DRR) guidelines at the local community level.
   Design/methodology/approach Between January 2014 and June 2015 we
   carried out an empirical investigation in two coastal communities in
   Bangladesh. We employed a qualitative research and Case Study approach,
   using techniques from the Participatory Rural Appraisal toolbox to
   collect data from local community members as well as government and NGO
   officials. Findings Our study revealed that interactive disaster
   governance, decentralization of disaster management, and compliance by
   local-level institutions with good governance principles and national
   policy guidelines can be extremely effective in reducing disaster-loss
   and damages. According to coastal community members, the local
   governments have generally failed to uphold good governance principles,
   and triangulated data confirm that the region at large suffers from
   rampant corruption, political favoritism, lack of transparency and
   accountability and minimal inclusion of local inhabitants in
   decision-making - all of which have severely impeded the successful
   implementation of national disaster-management policies. Research
   limitations/implications While considerable research on good governance
   has been pursued, our understanding of good disaster governance and
   their criteria is still poor. In addition, although numerous national
   disaster management policy and good governance initiatives have been
   taken in Bangladesh, like many other developing countries, the nature
   and extent of their local level implementation are not well known. This
   study contributes to these research gaps, with identification of further
   research agenda in these areas. Practical implications The study focuses
   on good disaster governance and management issues and practices, their
   strengths and limitations in the context of cyclone and storm surges
   along coastal Bangladesh. It offers specific good disaster governance
   criteria for improving multi-level successful implementation. The paper
   deals with International Sendai Framework that called for enhancement of
   local level community resilience to disasters. Thus, it contributes to
   numerous policy and practice areas relating to good disaster governance.
   Social implications Good disaster governance would benefit not only from
   future disaster losses but also from improved prevention and mitigation
   of natural hazards impact, benefiting society at large. Improvement in
   knowledge and practice in disaster-risk-reduction through good
   governance and effective management would ensure local community
   development and human wellbeing at the national level. Originality/value
   The failure of local-level government institutions to effectively
   implement national disaster management and resilience-building policies
   is largely attributable to a lack of financial and human resources,
   rampant corruption, a lack of accountability and transparency and the
   exclusion of local inhabitants from decision-making processes. Our study
   identified the specific manifestations of these failures in coastal
   communities in Bangladesh.
   These results underscore the vital need to address the wide gap between
   national DRR goals and the on-the-ground realities of policy
   implementation to successfully enhance the country's resilience to
   climate change-induced disasters.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change has resulted in severe consequences of
   hydrometeorological phenomena. The municipality of Los Cabos, Mexico,
   has been the most affected in the state of Baja California Sur by these
   hazards due to its location on the southern tip of the peninsula, being
   exposed with approximately 192 km of coastline; it is an environmental
   heritage that has made the area a primary tourist attraction in Mexico,
   which has caused a rapid growth in population with little knowledge
   about cyclone activity. In addition, there is limited knowledge
   regarding social indicators that measure vulnerability due to tropical
   cyclones. Based on the above, the objective of this study was to capture
   community perceptions about vulnerability related to tropical cyclones
   and to compare the results with real impacts and their index of
   socioenvironmental vulnerability, which includes indicators of exposure,
   sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, to provide useful information to
   form strategies to mitigate risk. Data were collected through a
   questionnaire-survey in 335 randomly selected households; we applied a
   probability model to the perception analysis and calculated an index to
   categorize vulnerability. We found differences between perceptions and
   real affectations, with 64\% of households categorized as being highly
   vulnerable to tropical cyclones, and we detected a lower perception
   about damage suffered to their households. The variables related to
   knowledge and local or foreigner status were predictors of vulnerability
   perception. We included georeferenced data on flooding hazard maps as a
   strategy for adaptation.},

Title = {Adaptation to sea level rise: Learning from present examples of land
   subsidence},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {189},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Current climate change discourses have expressed fear that many coastal
   communities would be forced to relocate in the face of rising water
   levels. However, despite the frequency and intensity with which such
   messages are being broadcasted throughout the world's media, there is
   little actual evidence of any relocation actually taking place, even
   though there are a number of past examples of relative sea level rise
   due to earthquake induced subsidence or groundwater extraction. Thus, in
   order to better understand the consequences of future sea level rise the
   authors analysed four instances of land subsidence that have taken place
   in the 20th and early 21st centuries (namely, adaptation strategies
   around Tokyo and Jakarta, and the experience of islands on the Danajon
   bank in the Philippines, and Kepulauan Seribu close to Jakarta). In all
   cases the inhabitants of densely populated coastal areas remain in
   place, despite the challenge of living with higher water levels.
   Adaptation was done through a five-phase process, starting with the
   construction of rather weak seawalls, which is then followed by the
   placement of pumps to drain water. Eventually, as the economic and
   technical capacities of coastal settlements improved, better seawalls
   were built, which then led to the reclamation of new areas, the
   elevation of entire districts or the construction of super levees. Thus,
   while it is clear that sea level rise will pose an additional financial
   strain on urbanised coastal areas, the authors found no evidence that
   any major coastal settlements will surrender a significant portion of
   its land area to the sea, given the range of adaptation options
   available. Rather, the opposite is true, and evidence indicates that new
   lines of defence will be built further into the water, effectively
   meaning that humans will encroach on the sea.},

Title = {A multi-hazards coastal vulnerability index of the east coast of
   Peninsular Malaysia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Southeast Asia, an increase of 20 million people in the coastal zone
   have accentuated the infrastructure risk. In Malaysia, littoral erosion
   due to seasonal monsoons can critically affect the coastal population
   and the country lacks practical plans to attenuate coastal erosion. In
   this study, a systematic coastal vulnerability assessment that covers 10
   physical and 5 socio-economic variables has been conducted at 16
   districts from 4 states. The aim is to highlight the most vulnerable
   districts with respect to a potential catastrophic event. Multivariate
   statistical analyses facilitated realistic and meaningful
   interpretations for optimal coastal zone planning. We show that
   socioeconomic variables are extremely relevant in all states except in
   southern Terengganu because it faces a direct impact of monsoon waves.
   Gender composition was found to be the most dominant coastal
   vulnerability factor for two states: Kelantan and Terengganu (north) due
   to the abundance of women involved in coastal trade and commerce.
   Besides, agriculture indicates a primary concern in the district of
   Johor. The results were categorized from very low to very high of
   vulnerability. The northern states of the east coast of Peninsular
   Malaysia show very high to high vulnerability relative to the southern
   states, which reveal moderate to very low vulnerability. In statistical
   analysis, it is shown that there is a similarity of 81.25\% between
   Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) and Hierarchical Agglomerative Cluster
   Analysis (HACA). The authorities could utilize the findings of this
   study to forecast potential shoreline recession and establish adaptation
   measures to their coastal erosion adaptation plan.},

Title = {Temperature-driven changes in behavioural unpredictability and
   personality in the beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {13-27},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Unexplained behavioural inconsistency in individual animals, termed
   unpredictability, could account for more than 50\% of variance in some
   behaviours. Unpredictability is likely to be selectively beneficial as a
   predator mitigation strategy and thus should be of adaptive value.
   Between-individual differences in behavioural unpredictability and how
   it changes across environmental contexts may thus have important
   consequences for selection, particularly in the face of extreme
   environmental changes. Associations between unpredictability and other
   risk-mitigating behavioural traits such as boldness could further
   influence individual fitness and population health. In this study, we
   investigated patterns of unpredictability in Actinia equina individuals
   at high and low temperature extremes. We investigated two
   boldness-related behaviours, immersion response (tentacle extension with
   submergence) and startle response (tentacle extension after a fright).
   We took bursts of six repeated measures of each behaviour, one at 6
   degrees C and one at 21 degrees C in two crossed-over treatments, and
   two at 13 degrees C in a control treatment. Large sample sizes allowed
   us to use double-hierarchical linear mixed modelling to investigate
   between-individual variation in unpredictability and in the plasticity
   of unpredictability. Significant between-individual variation in
   unpredictability was present for both behaviours and was influenced by
   temperature. For the startle response, animals collected from less
   stochastic environments were more unpredictable at 21 degrees C than
   those from more stochastic environments. For the immersion response,
   animals were more unpredictable at 21 degrees C than at 6 degrees C;
   this difference was clearer in those individuals that started at the
   high, rather than the low, temperature. Unpredictability was further
   positively correlated with the mean level immersion response at both
   temperatures; intermediate and moderately shy individuals were more
   unpredictable than bold in both environments. Metabolic rate in A.
   equina increases as the temperature rises, so energetically taxing
   unpredictability, coupled with reductions in foraging associated with
   shyer behaviour, could prove selectively detrimental during heatwaves.

Title = {Caribou Distribution and Movements in a Northern Alaska Oilfield},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1483-1499},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As industrial development increases in the range of barren-ground
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) across the warming Arctic, the need
   to understand the responses of caribou to development and to assess the
   effectiveness of mitigation measures increase accordingly. The Central
   Arctic Herd (CAH) of caribou ranges across northern Alaska, USA, and the
   herd's summer range includes the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oilfields,
   where the herd has been exposed to oil development for >4 decades. We
   used location data from global positioning system (GPS) radio-collars
   deployed on female CAH caribou for 106 collar-years, recording locations
   every 2 hours during 2008-2019, to examine caribou distribution and
   movements during 7 different seasons of the year in relation to
   infrastructure in the Kuparuk oilfield, which is characterized by more
   design improvements and mitigation measures than the older Prudhoe Bay
   oilfield. We examined movement metrics in terms of distance to gravel
   infrastructure (roads and pads) and time before and after movements
   across infrastructure (crossings). We also employed integrated
   step-selection analysis to compare caribou movements with random
   movements. Caribou distribution was influenced by insect activity,
   distance to coast, landcover, and terrain ruggedness, and we found large
   seasonal differences in caribou responses to infrastructure. Consistent
   with previous research findings, avoidance of areas near roads and pads
   was strongest during the calving season and some caribou used roads and
   pads as insect-relief habitat when oestrid flies (warble fly
   {[}Hypoderma tarandi] and nose bot fly {[}Cephenemyia trompe]) were
   active. Caribou moved through the Kuparuk oilfield repeatedly during
   summer, averaging >2 road or pad crossings a day when harassment by
   mosquitoes (Aedes{[}Ochlerotatus] spp.) and oestrid flies were the
   predominant factors influencing caribou movements. Caribou moved faster
   while crossing roads and pads but showed little pattern in speed or turn
   angle with distance to roads and pads. These results demonstrate that
   the effects of petroleum development on a caribou herd with long-term
   exposure to industrial activity vary widely by season. Maternal caribou
   avoid active roads and pads during calving, but the incorporation of
   appropriate mitigation measures in oilfield design allows caribou to
   move through the Kuparuk oilfield during other snow-free seasons. (c)

Title = {Sources of Variation in the Efficiency of Adopting Management
   Innovation: The Role of Absorptive Capacity Routines, Managerial
   Attention and Organizational Legitimacy},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1343-1371},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Drawing on two in-depth case studies, this paper develops a conceptual
   model of how absorptive capacity routines and their underlying processes
   of evolution influence the efficiency of management innovation
   adaptation processes. The model highlights three important relations.
   First, although different configurations of absorptive capacity routines
   can lead to the successful implementation of the same management
   innovation - namely the reconfiguration of firms' value chains through
   sourcing of business services from offshore countries - the sequence of
   developing routines, their adequacy, and the interdependencies fit
   between routines partly explain how rapidly and seamlessly a firm is
   able to implement a management innovation. Second, we identify
   managerial attention and organizational legitimacy as two critical and
   interrelated sources of variation of the efficiency in the process of
   adopting and adapting management innovations. Finally, attention
   direction by a top-level internal change agent is more effective than
   local problemistic search to foster managerial attention and
   organizational legitimacy to both the management innovation to be
   adopted, and the need to develop and put into practice an appropriate
   set of absorptive capacity routines.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Since the 1980's, measures mitigating the impact of transboundary air
   pollution have been implemented successfully as evidenced in the
   1980-2014 record of atmospheric sulphur pollution over the NE-Atlantic,
   a key region for monitoring background northern-hemisphere pollution
   levels. The record reveals a 72-79\% reduction in annual-average
   airborne sulphur pollution (SO4 and SO2, respectively) over the 35-year
   period. The NE-Atlantic, as observed from the Mace Head research station
   on the Irish coast, can be considered clean for 64\% of the time during
   which sulphate dominates PM1 levels, contributing 42\% of the mass, and
   for the remainder of the time, under polluted conditions, a carbonaceous
   (organic matter and Black Carbon) aerosol prevails, contributing 60\% to
   90\% of the PM1 mass and exhibiting a trend whereby its contribution
   increases with increasing pollution levels. The carbonaceous aerosol is
   known to be diverse in source and nature and requires sophisticated air
   pollution policies underpinned by sophisticated characterisation and
   source apportionment capabilities to inform selective
   emissions-reduction strategies. Inauspiciously, however, this
   carbonaceous concoction is not measured in regulatory Air Quality
   networks.},

Abstract = {Adapting to climate change is contingent on an ability to adjust before
   opportunity is lost. Given that research funding to understand
   adaptation is limited, rapid return on investment is critical. For
   Australian marine environments, climate-change impacts are well
   documented and adaptation opportunities have been identified across
   aquaculture, fisheries, conservation and tourism sectors. Here, we have
   evaluated the recent Australian scientific literature to determine (1)
   the degree to which climate-change impacts and adaptation have been
   addressed across sectors, and, specifically, (2) the role of a major
   research program instituted in 2009 to address priority climate-change
   questions for these sectors, namely, Australia's ` National Climate
   Change Adaptation Research Plan for Marine Biodiversity and Resources'
   (MNARP). Although the number of priority questions addressed by the
   general scientific literature increased in the 2009-2015 period, there
   was a 92\% increase in the number of priority questions addressed during
   the peak of MNARP (2013-2014). MNARP research also addressed a greater
   range of priority questions than did the general scientific literature,
   which showed consistency in the questions and study systems examined.
   Overall, structured research planning focussed attention on key
   climate-change questions, which is a critical consideration for enacting
   adaptation in the face of rapid climate change.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The study focuses on interpreting climate-induced disaster vulnerability
   in quantifiable form, caused by tropical cyclones emerging in the Bay of
   Bengal along the Eastern coast of India. The case of Jagatsinghpur, one
   of the six coastal districts of the Indian state of Odisha, has been
   explored for this purpose at a sub-regional level. An inclusive
   methodology comprising obser-vation, structured questionnaire surveys,
   and documentation of past occurrences of cyclonic storms was adopted for
   the research. The selection of indicators was made at both regional and
   sub-regional (rural) levels. A two-step analysis was done using Coastal
   Vulnerability Index Model and RIDIT scoring to evaluate the
   vulnerability along the Jagatsinghpur coastline, and rank socio-economic
   vulnerability indicators based on the perception of local inhabitants of
   the selected Tarasahi village. The coast of Jagatsinghpur is not a
   stable one and is undergoing fast rates of erosion and accretion, with
   variation in vulnerability levels at different points along the
   coastline. By analyzing past disaster management trends and existing
   conditions, the research outcome provides valuable information that can
   support future disaster management and risk reduction policies, spanning
   both proactive and reactive approaches.},

Abstract = {In recent years, challenges of storms, land loss and sea level rise are
   getting more and more serious in the coastal areas. Since its founding
   in 2009, the Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) of Louisiana State
   University has been trying to use innovative approaches to foster
   resilient coastal communities and ecosystems. This interview focuses on
   CSS's way of building teams, transdisciplinary collaboration, and their
   practices on large-scale planning in coastal areas, etc. As is stated by
   Jeffery Carney, director of CSS, climate change is increasingly
   recognized as a huge factor in coastal community design and is affecting
   inland regions as well, which has become a global issue to be seriously
   concerned. Carney also suggests that it is the duty of landscape
   architects to put the complexities of the ecosystem into a human
   context. Only with the application of systems thinking and with
   collaboration with a diverse team, can we realize design and development
   in productive and responsible ways.},

Title = {Communicating Climate Change Oceanically: Sea Level Rise Information
   Increases Mitigation, Inundation, and Global Warming Acceptance},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Cognitive impediments and global warming's gradual pace, among other
   factors, have inhibited some people from detecting climate change's
   everyday effects. This results in global warming often being perceived
   as a non-urgent, non-personal, threat that inhibits larger-scale
   collective action combatting climate change and public will regarding
   such action. Extreme weather events that global warming causes or
   exacerbates (e.g., hurricanes, flooding, heat, and droughts), however,
   are memorable due to their high emotional, social, and economic costs.
   Sea level rise is an especially salient American issue, given recent
   heightened storm surges, and the large population-segment who live in or
   near coastal areas with dangerous flooding risks. In this experiment, we
   show that providing American participants with U.S.-specific information
   about the economic and/or geographic/cartological effects and risks of
   sea level rise results in (a) an increased acceptance of oceanic rise as
   a phenomenon that is concerning and caused by global warming, and (b) an
   increased acceptance, in general, of global warming's anthropogenic
   nature. Communicating sea level rise information also led to (c) a
   general decrease in nationalism and (d) changes in the perceived
   effectiveness of mitigation strategies for sea level rise-specifically
   (d1) a decrease in the perceived effectiveness of constructing sea walls
   /dikes and (d2) an increase in the perceived effectiveness of phasing
   out fossil fuel usage. Overall, we find that communicating striking
   information about this oceanic by-product of global warming is an
   effective way to motivate acceptance and engagement with the issue of
   climate change in a reasonably broad manner. The experimental findings
   replicate, extend, and dovetail with prior experiments by our
   laboratory, bringing up to six the number of brief interventions (i.e.,
   of roughly 5 or fewer minutes) that have been proven to increase
   people's science-normative beliefs about global warming. Our
   laboratory's website, HowGlobalWarmingWorks.org, offers samples of these
   materials, which additionally include surprising statistics, textual and
   video explanations of global warming's mechanism, and a contrast of
   Earth's temperature rise since the 1880's vs. the U.S. stock market rise
   since then.},

Title = {SWOT risk analysis towards sustainable aquifer management along the
   Eastern Mediterranean},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {279},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {This study examines the risks of seawater intrusion (SWI) in data scarce
   aquifers along the Eastern Mediterranean by quantifying the interaction
   of the main natural, anthropogenic and climatic drivers, while also
   considering varying abilities of implementing adaptation and mitigation
   measures. For this purpose, we conducted a semi quantitative Strengths,
   Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis representing a
   first attempt at integrating a complex physical process with multi
   layered influences in a SWOT analysis model that was tested at 26
   coastal aquifers with varying levels of SWI severity. The analysis
   results showed alarming signs of SWI at several eastern and southeastern
   aquifers, particularly those underlying densely populated centers (i.e.
   Beirut, Lebanon; Magoza, Cyprus; Gaza, Palestine and the Nile Delta,
   Egypt). The analysis also highlighted adaptive capabilities that appear
   to be strong in Cyprus, Israel and Turkey, emerging in Egypt, and weak
   in Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine. The risks exhibited a strong and
   statistically significant positive relationship with the reported status
   of SWI at the tested aquifers thus providing an effective
   decision-making tool towards the preliminary assessment of SWI in
   regions with data scarcity. The study concludes with proposing a
   framework for sustainable aquifer management in the East Med region with
   emphasis on controlling SWI risks.},

Abstract = {Determining the contribution of urbanization to extreme high-temperature
   events is essential to the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin,
   and Hebei (BTH). Based on the dynamic data of land-use change in every 5
   years, this study uses the coupled WRF-Building Effect
   Parameterization/Building Energy Model (BEP/BEM) at 1-km grid spacing to
   quantify the contribution of BTH urbanization to the intensity and
   frequency of hourly extreme high-temperature events in summer. From 1990
   to 2015, extreme events over Beijing and its south increased by similar
   to 1.5 degrees-2 degrees C in intensity and by 50-100 h in frequency,
   both of which were even higher in central Beijing and Shijiazhuang. The
   increases of multiyear average urbanization contribution ratios to the
   intensity and frequency reached 3.3\% and 51.6\% at the 99\% confidence
   level (p < 0.01) from 1990 to 2015, respectively. The corresponding
   contributions increased 1.8 and 1.2 times more significantly in the
   megacities (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang) than small and
   medium-sized cities. Therefore, the rapid urbanization has substantially
   enhanced the extreme high-temperature events in BTH. It is necessary to
   limit the urbanization growth rate and implement effective adaptation
   and mitigation strategies to sustain BTH development.},

Title = {SYSTEMIC APPROACH OF THE IMPACT INDUCED BY CLIMATE CHANGES ON
   HYDROTHERMIC FACTORS AT THE ROMANIAN BLACK SEA COAST},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {455-467},
Abstract = {Systemic global environmental changes are manifested in the whole Earth
   system and represent the global effects of anthropogenic activity on the
   environment. Global climate changes are included in these global
   environmental changes. The combined effects of climate change, extreme
   weather and human alterations of the environment are especially
   pronounced in the coastal zone where people and ecosystem goods and
   services are most concentrated and inputs of energy and matter from
   land, sea and air converge. These realities call for a more systemic and
   adaptive approach to resource management, environmental protection,
   coastal zone management, coastal engineering, an approach that considers
   the effects both of human activities and natural variability change in
   an ecosystem context. Implementing such an approach requires the
   capability to routinely and rapidly detect and predict changes in the
   state of the coastal environment. Identifying variations in hydrothermal
   Romanian Black Sea coastal area will be based on data about temperature,
   rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Period considered is
   1999-2008, and coastal stations Sulina, Constanta and Mangalia are
   analysed. Data used have hydrothermal character and provide information
   on water demand of the atmosphere, depending on the size of the
   temperature factor. Temporal variability of hydrothermal factors is
   presented with some statistical parameters. They are linked as
   indicators of central tendency and dispersion measurement. A model for
   estimating the distribution of intra-annual values for hydrothermal
   factors is proposed for the period analysed.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban green infrastructure (UGI) within sustainable stormwater
   management provides numerous benefits to urban residents, including
   urban heat island (UHI) mitigation. Cost-benefit analyses (CBA) for UGI
   have been conducted at neighborhood level with a focus on stormwater
   management, but valuations of reductions in heat-related
   hospitalizations and mortality are lacking. These benefits create
   significant social value; the quantification thereof is essential for
   urban planning in providing a scientific foundation for the inclusion of
   UGI in UHI mitigation strategies. This study assesses the potential of
   three UGI scenarios developed for an urban neighborhood in Berlin,
   Germany. First, climate data analyses were conducted to determine the
   cooling effects of tree drains, facade greening, and green roofs.
   Second, a CBA was performed for each scenario to value UHI mitigation by
   estimating the damage costs avoided in reduced heat-related
   hospitalizations and fatalities, using the net present value (NPV) and
   benefit-cost ratio (BCR) as indicators of economic feasibility. The
   results indicate heat mitigation capabilities of all three UGI types,
   with tree drains achieving the strongest cooling effects. Regarding
   economic feasibility, all scenarios achieve positive NPVs and BCRs above
   one. The findings confirm the potential of stormwater management in
   mitigating UHI and generating substantial social value.},

Title = {Institutional capacity-building for targeting sea-level rise in the
   climate adaptation of Swedish coastal zone management. Lessons from
   Coastby},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {265-273},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For coastal areas across the world, sea-level rise and problems of
   coastal erosion and coastal flooding are expected to increase over the
   next hundred years. At the same time political pressure for continued
   waterfront planning and development of coastal areas threatens to
   increase our societal vulnerability, and necessitating climate
   adaptation in coastal zone management. The institutional dimension has
   been identified as important for ensuring a more robust adaptation to
   both current climate variability and future climate change. In this
   paper, lessons regarding institutional constraints for climate
   adaptation are drawn from a Swedish case-study on local coastal zone
   management, illustrating the diverse and complex nature of institutional
   capacity-building. The aim of the paper is to illustrate critical
   factors that from an institutional perspective condition the capacity to
   achieve a more integrated, strategic and proactive climate adaptation
   and for turning ``rules on paper{''} to working practice, based on
   case-study experiences from Coastby. Following and expanding a framework
   for analysing institutional capacity-building we learnt that a selective
   few key actors had played a critical role in building a strong external
   networking capacity with a flip-side in terms of a weak internal
   coordinating capacity and lack of mutual ownership of coastal erosion
   between sectoral units e.g. risk-management, planning and environment.
   We also found a weak vertical administrative interplay and lack of
   formal coherent policy, procedures and regulations for managing coastal
   erosion between local, regional and national administrations. Further,
   tensions and trade-offs between policy-agendas, values and political
   priorities posed a barrier for capacity-building in coastal zone
   management which calls for processes to mediate conflicting priorities

Title = {Coastal development and risks of flooding in Morocco: The cases of
   Tahaddart and Saidia coasts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {164},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Coastal areas provide a large array of ecosystems services, contributing
   to the economic welfare of local communities. However, they are more and
   more submitted to both human pressures and natural forcing. Climate
   change creates additional risks and is expected to intensify the loss
   and degradation of coastal low lying-areas. The aim of this paper is to
   assess the risk of flooding due to sea-level rise and storm-surges for
   two Moroccan coasts: Tahaddart, a relatively underdeveloped coast and
   Saidia which has experienced intense urbanization over the last decade.
   Their risk assessment was compared to that carried out on the even more
   developed coast of Tetouan. The main findings of this study are: (i) the
   high level of risk that threatens these coasts is due to their low
   elevation and the value of the exposed assets; (ii) there is a positive
   relationship between the coastal risk and the build-up rate: the more a
   coastal area is artificialized, the more its risk index is high; and
   (iii) Coastal risk assessment is a useful tool that can help decision
   makers and coastal managers in the development of adaptation strategies
   and management plans to protect coastal ecosystems and make them
   resilient in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {Estuarine and shallow coastal systems (ESCS) are recognized as not only
   significant organic carbon reservoirs but also emitters of CO2 to the
   atmosphere through air-sea CO2 gas exchange, thus posing a dilemma on
   ESCS's role in climate change mitigation measures. However, some studies
   have shown that coastal waters take up atmospheric CO2 (C-atm), although
   the magnitude and determinants remain unclear. We argue that the
   phenomenon of net uptake of C-atm by ESCS is not unusual under a given
   set of terrestrial inputs and geophysical conditions. We assessed the
   key properties of systems that show the net C-atm uptake and found that
   they are often characteristic of human-dominated systems: (1) input of
   high terrestrial nutrients, (2) input of treated wastewater in which
   labile carbon is highly removed, and (3) presence of hypoxia. We propose
   that human-dominated ESCS are worthy of investigation as a contributor
   to climate change mitigation.},

Title = {Australian policies on water management and climate change: are they
   supporting the sustainable development goals and improved health and
   well-being?},
Journal = {GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {Background: Sustainable management of the natural environment is
   essential. Continued environmental degradation will lead to worsened
   health outcomes in countries and across generations. The Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for viewing the
   preservation of natural environments and the promotion of health,
   wellbeing and health equity as interconnected pursuits. Within the SDG
   framework the goals of promoting environmental sustainability and human
   health are unified through attention to the social determinants of
   health and health equity (SDH/HE). This paper presents findings from a
   document analysis of all Australian environment sector policies and
   selected legislation to examine whether and how current approaches
   support progress toward achieving SDG goals on water, climate change,
   and marine ecosystems (Goals 6, 13 and 14), and to consider implications
   for health and health equity.
   Results: Consideration of a broad range of SDH/HE was evident in the
   analysed documents. Related collaborations between environment and
   health sectors were identified, but the bulk of proposed actions on
   SDH/HE were initiated by the environment sector as part of its core
   business. Strengths of Australian policy in regard to SDGs 6, 13 and 14
   are reflected in recognition of the effects of climate change, a strong
   cohesive approach to marine park protection, and recognition of the need
   to protect existing water and sanitation systems from future threats.
   However, climate change strategies focus predominately on resilience,
   adaptation and heat related health effects, rather than on more
   comprehensive mitigation policies. The findings emphasise the importance
   of strengthened cross-sectoral action to address both the drivers and
   effects of environmental degradation. A lack of policy coherence between
   jurisdictions was also evident in several areas, compounded by
   inadequate national guidance, where vague strategies and nonspecific
   devolution of responsibilities are likely to compromise coordination and
   accountability.
   Conclusions: Evidence on planetary health recognises the
   interconnectedness of environmental and human health and, as such,
   suggests that ineffective management of climate change and water pose
   serious risks to both the natural environment and human well-being. To
   address these risks more effectively, and to achieve the SDGs, our
   findings indicate that cross-jurisdiction policy coherence and national
   coordination must be improved. In addition, more action to address
   global inequities is required, along with more comprehensive approaches
   to climate change mitigation.},

Title = {Policies and mechanisms to address climate-induced migration and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {86-104},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to assess policies and mechanisms in Caribbean
   and Pacific small island developing states (SIDS) that address
   climate-induced migration and displacement. The migration of communities
   away from vulnerable regions is highly likely to be an adaptation
   strategy used in low-elevation SIDS, as the impacts of climate change
   are likely to result in significant loss and damage, threatening their
   very territorial existence. SIDS must ensure that residents relocate to
   less vulnerable locations and may need to consider international
   movement of residents. Ad hoc approaches to migration and displacement
   may result in increased vulnerability of residents, making the
   development and enforcement of comprehensive national policies that
   address these issues a necessity.
   Design/methodology/approach - Interviews with United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiators for SIDS as well as
   analysis of secondary data, including Intended Nationally Determined
   Contributions, are utilized to determine policies and mechanisms in
   place that focus on climate-induced migration and displacement.
   Findings - While climate change is acknowledged as an existential
   threat, few SIDS have policies or mechanisms in place to guide
   climate-induced migration and displacement. Potential exists for
   migration and displacement to be included in policies that integrate
   disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation along with
   national sustainable development plans. Regional bodies are beneficial
   to providing guidance to SIDS in the development of nationally
   appropriate frameworks to address climate-induced migration and
   displacement.
   Originality/value - Existing gaps in policies and mechanisms and
   challenges faced by SIDS in developing strategies to address
   climate-induced migration and displacement are explored. Best practices
   and recommendations for strategies for SIDS to address migration and
   displacement are provided.},

   ISSN 0749.0208
   The coastal city of the Gold Coast, Australia is the first of eighteen
   sub-domain studies within South East Queensland (SEQ) that has been
   measured using the index of sustainable functionality (ISF). As a
   quantitative definition of sustainability, the ISF offers an adaptive
   method of measurement. It does so based on an engineering standpoint
   that institutes stable energy and mass transfer indicates longevity over
   spatial and temporal scales. Sustainability trends are measured using
   adaptive sustainability which incorporates complex interactions by
   making use of a matrix-based approach. Twenty-three functions were
   utilised in the study and measured against a total of 53 indicators. The
   span of the research is between the years 2000 to 2005. The results of
   the study indicate that the ISF of the Gold Coast can assist in
   improving the overall sustainability of the region. The overall result
   shows sustainability trends have slightly improved and are heading
   toward a sustainable blueprint for rapidly developing regions.
   Monitoring of trends would reduce future unsustainable action and
   optimise the ISF to the region and beyond.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems provide important services that can help people adapt to
   climate variability and change. Recognizing this role of ecosystems,
   several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an
   ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific
   literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and
   trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support
   adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities
   facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating
   water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3)
   forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced
   climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from
   climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating
   temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides
   evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability
   to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain,
   particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas.
   Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant
   literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps.
   Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human
   adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between
   ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency,
   costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees. Pilot
   projects under implementation could serve as learning sites and existing
   information could be systematized and revisited with a climate change
   adaptation lens. WIREs Clim Change 2012, 3:581596. doi: 10.1002/wcc.195

Title = {Behavioural research priorities for the study of animal response to
   climate change},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Behavioural traits are thought to be important determinants of the
   resilience of animal species to a rapidly changing global climate.
   Although increasing temperature has taken centre stage in the debate
   over climate change, animals will have to survive more than just extreme
   heat to persist in the Anthropocene. The aim of this review is to
   stimulate interest in the opportunities for integrative and applied
   behavioural study of how animals can survive life-threatening weather
   events, in order to help achieve the societal goal of maintaining viable
   wildlife populations under future climate scenarios. First, using the
   thermoregulatory behaviour of a hypothetical ground squirrel species as
   an example, we explore how different scenarios of behavioural
   flexibility, plasticity, adaptation, exaptation and management action
   can lead to population persistence or extinction. Next, we propose that
   considering weather events such as heatwaves, storms and floods,
   wildfire and drought as selective pressures worthy of investigation
   provides a new research framework for climate-related conservation
   behaviour. In our review we provide examples of the responses of animals
   to different types of weather extremes and describe behavioural
   adaptations to environments with extreme climates. We give
   methodological recommendations to jump start climate change research by
   behaviourists. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for using citizen
   science and a public video repository to foster evidence-based decision
   making for managing habitats and prioritizing species conservation
   efforts in light of the threats to biodiversity posed by climate change.

Title = {Potential of seagrass habitat restorations as nature-based solutions:
   Practical and scientific implications in Indonesia},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Abstract = {Seagrasses offer diverse ecosystem services, yet, they are among the
   most threatened ecosystems. When degraded or destroyed, their services
   are lost or reduced in the process, affecting, for instance, local
   communities directly dependent on their livelihood provision. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that climate
   change is projected to worsen over time; thus, there is an urgent need
   for mitigation strategies in practice and also in the longer term. This
   work aims to provide an alternative perspective of seagrass restoration
   as a nature based solution (NbS) on a global scale, yet, giving an
   emphasis on tropical regions such as Indonesia. We focused on seagrass
   restorations which are not yet well established in comparison with other
   restoration programs (e.g., mangroves) despite their critical roles. We
   present in this work how restoring seagrass meadows fits the global
   standard of NbS published by the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature (IUCN). The results of this study can serve as a basis for
   promoting seagrass restorations as NbS against climate change
   particularly in countries with a wide extent of seagrass coverage.},

Title = {A satellite image-based analysis of factors contributing to the
   green-space cool island intensity on a city scale},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {846-853},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces provide cooler microclimates and create localized
   urban cool islands and, as part of an adaptation strategy to cope with
   future urban climate change, have been proposed as a means to mitigate
   the urban heat island effect. Numerous previous research papers have
   discussed green-space size, type, and vegetation density, as well as
   many other factors that might influence green-space cooling effects.
   However, little has been done with regard to exploring and quantifying
   the characteristics of the green-space cool island (UCI). It is also
   largely unknown whether or how the patterns of green space and land use,
   as well as the adjacent urban thermal environment, affect UCIs. In this
   paper, the land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved from satellite
   imagery. The UCI was identified, and one of the UCI characteristics, the
   UCI intensity, was defined. Multiple linear regression models were then
   used to explore and quantify the combined effects of factors related to
   the UCI intensity. The results show that the intensity differed between
   UCIs, and correlated significantly with the extent of and mean
   temperature reduction associated with an UCI. Multiple linear regression
   analysis found that UCI intensity was affected by areas of forest
   vegetation and its spatial arrangements, as well as by the composition
   of the cool island and its neighboring thermal environment. The study
   validated the suitability of using intensity as an indicator of the UCI.
   Identifying the UCI as a result of the green-space cooling effect, will
   help in the management and planning of the spatial arrangement of green
   spaces in cities to reduce the effects of the urban thermal environment
   and help cities adapt to climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {Increasing impacts by Antarctica's most widespread invasive plant
   species as result of direct competition with native vascular plants},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {51},
Pages = {19-40},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Biological invasions represent significant economic and conservation
   challenges, though it is widely acknowledged that their impacts are
   often poorly documented and difficult to predict. In the Antarctic, one
   non-native vascular plant species is widespread and studies have shown
   negative impacts on native flora. Using field ``common garden{''}
   experiments, we evaluate the competitive impact of the increasingly
   widespread invasive grass Poa annua on the only two native vascular
   species of Antarctica, the forb Colobanthus quitensis and the grass
   Deschampsia antarctica. We focus on interactions between these three
   plant species under current and a future, wetter, climate scenario, in
   terms of density of individuals. Our analysis demonstrates Poa annua has
   the potential to have negative impacts on the survival and growth of the
   native Antarctic vascular species. Under predicted future wetter
   conditions, C. quitensis communities will become more resistant to
   invasion, while those dominated by D. antarctica will become less
   resistant. Under a recently developed unified scheme for non-native
   species impacts, P. annua can be considered a species that can cause
   potentially moderate to major impacts in Antarctica. If current patterns
   of increased human pressure and regional climate change persist and
   mitigation action is not taken (i.e. reduction of propagule pressure and
   eradication or control measures), P. annua is likely to spread in
   Antarctica, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with
   significant negative consequences for some of the most remote and
   pristine ecosystems worldwide. Tighter biosecurity across all operators
   in the region, improved surveillance for the species, and prompt,
   effective control actions will reduce these risks.},

Title = {The `Pacific Adaptive Capacity Analysis Framework': guiding the

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {1039-1051},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Community-based adaptation (CBA) is becoming an increasingly popular
   approach to climate change adaptation in the Pacific islands region.
   Building adaptive capacity should be an important component of projects
   supporting CBA. The literature establishes that adaptive capacity is
   highly context and culture specific. However, to date, there has been
   little research into the factors and processes that enable adaptive
   capacity in Pacific island communities. This paper discusses the Pacific
   Adaptive Capacity Analysis Framework, a theoretical framework developed
   to guide assessment of adaptive capacity for the purposes of supporting
   CBA projects. The framework identifies seven broad factors and several
   sub-factors of Pacific-specific adaptive capacity: (1) human capital;
   (2) social capital; (3) belief systems, worldviews, and values; (4)
   resources and their distribution; (5) options for adaptation,
   livelihood, and food supply; (6) information and awareness; and (7)
   history of dealing with climate stress. The paper presents a case study
   of adaptive capacity from a community in the Solomon Islands and
   concludes that unlike many adaptive capacity determinants identified in
   the broader international literature, function-based (factors shaping
   ability to access and use resources) and cognitive (for example, values
   and belief systems) determinants are of particular relevance in the
   Pacific community social and cultural context. The key to building upon
   cognitive and function-based aspects of adaptive capacity is increasing
   the ability of people to liaise with external support organisations to
   plan and acquire resources for adaptation on their own terms.},

Abstract = {Deltas are highly sensitive to erosion, flooding, and salinization with
   consequential agricultural -productivity losses and out-migration, which
   is a preferred adaptive measure for the inhabitants of deltaic islands.
   This study investigates the associations between agricultural
   productivity decrease, household poverty and the probability of
   out-migration in the Indian Sundarban Delta (ISD). Using newly collected
   survey data from randomly selected households within the ISD, we
   analysed these relationships by means of descriptive statistics and
   regression modeling. Results suggest the significant positive
   association between a decrease in agricultural productivity and
   out-migration. The results further show that ceteris paribus,
   out-migration is negatively associated with household poverty, which is
   likely to be explained by the effect of remittances. The results yield
   important policy implications at the local level and can contribute to
   the progress towards sustainable livelihoods in these deltaic islands.},

Title = {The influence of tree traits on urban ground surface shade cooling},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The physical nature of the built urban environment gives rise to urban
   heat islands (UHI), making many cities frequently thermally
   uncomfortable in the summer, with potentially serious effects on human
   health. When climate change effects of higher summer temperatures and
   prolonged heatwaves are factored in, it is clear that adaptive measures
   are needed to ensure the liveability of cities. The shade provided by
   planting trees is one such adaptation measure. This study, in Bolzano,
   Italy, used a thermal camera to record the surface temperatures of three
   common urban surfaces - asphalt, porphyry, and grass - in the shade of
   332 single tree crowns, of 85 different species, during the peak
   temperature period of summer days. By comparing with the temperature of
   adjacent unshaded ground, estimates of the degree of surface cooling
   were made. Measurements at three locations within the shadow revealed
   higher cooling in the centre and at the western edge. The cooling was
   related to a multitude of tree traits, of which Leaf Area Index estimate
   (LAIcept) and crown width were the most important. Median average
   cooling of 16.4, 12.9 and 8.5 degrees C was seen in the western edge of
   the tree shade for asphalt, porphyry and grass, respectively. Maximum
   temperatures were reduced by roughly 19 degrees C for all surface types.
   Coniferous trees were capable of providing high cooling, however, crown
   dimensions may limit the receiving surface area. Descriptive and
   predictive multiple linear regression models were able to predict
   cooling with some success from several of the predictor variables
   (LAIcept and gap fraction). Strategic planting of single trees in cities
   can have significant impacts on the absorption of solar radiation by
   ground surface materials thus reducing the heat storage that contributes
   to UHIs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {258},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Cold adapted bacteria undertake array of adaptive strategies and remain
   active with an active temperature range of 0-40 degrees C and activity
   in the acidic to neutral pH range (pH 4.5-7.0) to withstand in extreme
   environmental conditions and to retain metabolic and enzymatic
   activities. In soil, water or food, they were reported to comprise
   higher population as compared to mesophilic and thermophilic population
   (can make up to 86\% of the total population). The present work
   critically discusses a detailed account of different strategies of cold
   adaptations in bacteria at cellular (viz. regulation of cell membrane
   fluidity through lipidcomposition, carotenoids production,
   cryoprotectants) and molecular level (differential gene expression,
   chaperones, proline isomerisation, antifreeze proteins, proteins and
   enzymes), cold-active cellulases from psychrophiles, their production
   strategies, the factors affecting and their properties and cold-active
   enzyme activities for different applications with special focus on
   cold-active cellulases. Due to more flexibility in protein structure and
   related higher binding capacity with the substrates, cold enzymes have
   more catalytic activities (around 10 times more than amesophilic enzyme)
   at cold temperatures. Attempt is made to critically analyze the
   practical relevance and significance of these aspects to help explore
   future directions of research related to scope of versatile applications
   of cold active enzyme. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Present-day global warming has great consequences, both for individuals
   and on a larger scale for society as a whole. However, environmental
   changes also affected everyday life in the past. The purpose of this
   article is to apply perspectives developed in studies of how
   contemporary societies adapt to shore-level changes and to use this
   insight in a study of the way Mesolithic populations handled a situation
   of large land uplift. More specifically, the author discusses four
   common adaptation strategies devised to cope with changing sea level,
   both on a site level and on a regional scale - to accommodate, relocate,
   protect, or not respond to the changing environment. In the Oslo Fjord
   in Norway, the shorelines moved from approximately 200-40 m above the
   present-day sea level in the period 9300-3900 cal BC, caused by the
   strong post-glacial rebound. Along the shores lived populations that
   based much of their life on the local marine resources. Building on
   information from the large habitation area Haysjodalen and a statistical
   analysis of 529 critically selected sites in the region, the author
   concludes that single sites were systematically accommodated or
   relocated when the distance to the shores receded. However, sea level
   changes caused more dramatic regional landscape transformation and a
   less bountiful environment c. 5000 cal BC, with a period of
   maladaptation and a subsequent population collapse as a result. Like
   modem societies facing human-caused climate changes, the Mesolithic
   population had difficulties in handling the need for large-scale shifts
   in their society.},

Abstract = {The interdecadal changes in typhoon (categories 1-3) frequency and its
   genesis condition over the western North Pacific during the period of
   1979-2011 are investigated with consideration for discrepancies among
   best track datasets. To tide over data uncertainty, a detection-produced
   dataset is utilized as a homogeneous dataset with five available best
   track datasets. Typhoon experienced interdecadal changes around the
   mid-1990s and the mid-2000s in their genesis conditions. Even under the
   oceanic warm state, typhoon frequency has decreased since the mid-1990s,
   showing a northwestward movement of its genesis location over the main
   formation region. The eastward gradient of vertical wind shear is the
   most significant factor for the change in typhoon genesis condition in
   recent decades. The vertical wind shear behavior is strongly linked with
   zonal asymmetry of local SST. We demonstrate that a westward gradient of
   local SST is the most important modulator of the recent typhoon behavior
   through the movement of favorable genesis location. The present results
   indicate that the horizontal distribution, not magnitude, of local SST
   can be a key factor for prediction of future typhoon activity, thus
   contributing to natural disaster mitigation and climate change
   adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {The delays of trains have serious impact on the efficiency of operation,
   and on the passenger satisfaction which reduces the quality of service.
   The quality of service needs to be enhanced and the energy saving is
   drawing more and more attentions. In this paper, we propose an
   energy-efficient adjustment approach to mitigate the delays of trains,
   and to decrease energy consumption, simultaneously. To reduce energy
   consumption, energy-efficient operation strategies are considered. We
   seek the best coasting point to decrease the tractive energy. And we
   optimize the overlapping time of accelerating phase and braking phase
   for contiguous trains to increase the utilization of regenerative
   braking energy. Finally, the simulation is presented to show the
   proposed approach. We illustrate that the current adjustment approach
   could result in unnecessary energy consumption. By contrast, our
   approach can observably mitigate the delays of trains, and provide
   better energy-efficient effect.},

Abstract = {Cool roofs and green roofs are two popular methods to mitigate the urban
   heat island and improve urban climates. The effectiveness of different
   urban heat island mitigation strategies in the summer of 2013 in the
   Yangtze River delta, China, is investigated using the Weather Research
   and Forecasting (WRF) Model coupled with a physically based single-layer
   urban canopy model. The modifications to the roof surface changed the
   urban surface radiation balance and then modified the local surface
   energy budget. Both cool roofs and green roofs led to a lower surface
   skin temperature and near-surface air temperature. Increasing the roof
   albedo to 0.5 caused a similar effectiveness as covering 25\% of urban
   roofs with vegetation; increasing the roof albedo to 0.7 caused a
   similar near-surface air temperature decrease as 50\% green roof
   coverage. The near-surface relative humidity increased in both cool roof
   and green roof experiments because of the combination of the impacts of
   increases in specific humidity and decreases in air temperature. The
   regional impacts of cool roofs and green roofs were evaluated using a
   regional effect index. Aregional impact was found for near-surface air
   temperature and specific/relative humidity when the percentage of roofs
   covered with high-albedo materials or green roofs reached a higher
   fraction (greater than 50\%). The changes in the vertical profiles of
   temperature cause a more stable atmospheric boundary layer over the
   urban area; at the same time, the crossover phenomena occurred above the
   boundary layer due to the decrease in vertical wind speed.},

Title = {Modelling the potential distribution of Betula utilis in the Himalaya},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {69-83},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Developing sustainable adaptation pathways under climate change
   conditions in mountain regions requires accurate predictions of treeline
   shifts and future distribution ranges of treeline species. Here, we
   model for the first time the potential distribution of Betula utilis, a
   principal Himalayan treeline species, to provide a basis for the
   analysis of future range shifts. Our target species Betula utilis is
   widespread at alpine treelines in the Himalayan mountains, the
   distribution range extends across the Himalayan mountain range. Our
   objective is to model the potential distribution of B. utilis in
   relation to current climate conditions. We generated a dataset of 590
   occurrence records and used 24 variables for ecological niche modelling.
   We calibrated Generalized Linear Models using the Akaike Information
   Criterion (AIC) and evaluated model performance using
   threshold-independent (AUC, Area Under the Curve) and
   threshold-dependent (TSS, True Skill Statistics) characteristics as well
   as visual assessments of projected distribution maps. We found two
   temperature-related (Mean Temperature of the Wettest Quarter,
   Temperature Annual Range) and three precipitation-related variables
   (Precipitation of the Coldest Quarter, Average Precipitation of March,
   April and May and Precipitation Seasonality) to be useful for predicting
   the potential distribution of B. utilis. All models had high predictive
   power (AUC >= 0.98 and TSS >= 0.89). The projected suitable area in the
   Himalayan mountains varies considerably, with most extensive
   distribution in the western and central Himalayan region. A substantial
   difference between potential and real distribution in the eastern
   Himalaya points to decreasing competitiveness of B. utilis under more
   oceanic conditions in the eastern part of the mountain system. A
   comparison between the vegetation map of Schweinfurth (1957) and our
   current predictions suggests that B. utilis does not reach the upper
   elevational limit in vast areas of its potential distribution range due
   to anthropogenically caused treeline depressions. This study underlines
   the significance of accuracies of current environmental niche models for
   species distribution modelling under climate change scenarios. Analysing
   and understanding the environmental factors driving the current
   distribution of B. utilis is crucial for the prediction of future range
   shifts of B. utilis and other treeline species, and for deriving
   appropriate climate change adaptation strategies. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {Moving towards multi-level governance of coastal managed retreat:
   Insights and prospects from France},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {213},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Policies aimed at adaptation to sea-level rise advocate new approaches,
   no longer based only on protection but also seeking to reduce the
   vulnerability of densely-urbanized coastal zones, especially through
   managed retreat or anticipatory relocation. However, such relocation
   faces substantial challenges and constraints at all governance and
   policy scales. This article elucidates some of the social and
   institutional conditions for putting relocation on the agenda and
   implementing it in the case of France. It addresses the current
   situation through an analysis of the multi-level governance processes
   (national guidelines and frameworks, local experiments and regional
   strategies) which contribute to the production of ``actionable
   knowledge{''} for relocation in terms of legitimacy, credibility,
   applicability and acceptability. The detailed analysis of the stages and
   types of actors and processes involved reveals the hindrances, in terms
   of inertia and status quo, found at each level of decisionmaking and
   action, as well as the positive role of actors or policy entrepreneurs
   catalyzing interactions between these different levels. This multi-level
   governance enables a hybridization of initial standards, information
   sharing and collective learning which, together with operational
   proposals derived from studies and experiments, create conducive
   conditions for coastal relocation and spatial reconfiguration projects.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyse the potentials, obstacles and
   socio-economic condition of swamp land development for food estate
   programmes in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia.The results for qualitative
   descriptive and quantitative analysis showed there were approximately
   33.4 million hectares of swamp land area, 9.5 million of which have the
   potential for agricultural land, particularly for rice. The rationale of
   food estate location are a wide area of land availability, with abundant
   water resources. The main obstacles of land use of swamp land are: (a)
   low soil pH (acid); (b) low NPK content in the soil; (c) high Al and Fe
   solubility (toxic); and (d) tidal influence such that during the wet
   season the land is flooded and during the dry season the land is
   dry.This research recommends that swamp land development for food
   estates requires: water management infrastructure rehabilitation, land
   management, adaptive and potential commodity selection and farmer
   institution strengthening and facilitation.},

Abstract = {Underwater sonar imaging is a significant means for a variety of
   maritime work. However, the sonar images are corrupted by signal
   dependent speckle noise, which restricts the potential practical
   applications. In this paper, we propose a novel variational approach
   that addresses the adaptive sonar image denoising problem. To accurately
   describe the signal dependent characteristic of noise for real sensors,
   we utilize a generalized noise model, which can be adapted to represent
   various types of noise. With the generalized noise model, we formulate
   the denoising problem via a variational approach. Finally, we present a
   modified primal and dual method to efficiently solve the variational
   minimization problem. Experimental results on both simulated and real
   data validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

Pages = {13-24},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Asian cities are at the forefront of climate change impacts. Given the
   size of city economies, the economic losses caused by climate-induced
   extreme weather can be quite significant. Together, the cities of
   Guangzhou, Mumbai, Shenzen, Tianjin, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata, and
   Jakarta incurred \$1520 million (USD) in annual losses due to coastal
   flooding in 2005 alone. By 2050, the annual loss incurred as a result of
   coastal flooding in these cities is projected to increase to \$32,079
   million. In the light of the projected increase in climate-induced
   extreme weather events and associated loss, it is important to
   understand where Asian cities are in terms of climate change adaptation
   planning and governance. I use publicly available data and information
   published between 2004 and 2014 to capture urban climate change
   adaptation activities implemented in Asian cities, their sectoral
   distribution, and nature. This research finds that Asian cities are at a
   very early stage of climate change adaptation planning and governance.
   Countries with a larger number of cities implementing urban adaptation
   activities are the ones where central governments provide policy
   directives and support required for urban climate change adaptation
   planning and governance. There are two major flaws in the way urban
   climate change adaptation planning and governance is being carried out
   in Asian cities. First, the majority of urban climate change adaptation
   activities are concentrated in only one sector-disaster risk management.
   Second, approximately two thirds of urban climate change adaptation
   activities are reactive in nature. What cities in Asia need is an
   optimal mix of proactive and reactive adaptation. Without proactive
   adaptation actions, cities in Asia will not be able to address the full
   range of climate change hazards in strategic and cost-effective manner.},

Title = {Global hotspots for coastal ecosystem-based adaptation},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Helping the world's coastal communities adapt to climate change impacts
   requires evaluating the vulnerability of coastal communities and
   assessing adaptation options. This includes understanding the potential
   for `natural' infrastructure (ecosystems and the biodiversity that
   underpins them) to reduce communities' vulnerability, alongside more
   traditional `hard' infrastructure approaches. Here we present a
   spatially explicit global evaluation of the vulnerability of
   coastal-dwelling human populations to key climate change exposures and
   explore the potential for coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to
   climate change (ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)). We find that
   mangroves and coral reefs are particularly well situated to help people
   cope with current weather extremes, a function that will only increase
   in importance as people adapt to climate change now and in coming
   decades. We find that around 30.9 million people living within 2km of
   the coast are highly vulnerable to tropical storms and sea-level rise
   (SLR). Mangroves and coral reefs overlap these threats to at least 5.3
   and 3.4 million people, respectively, with substantial potential to
   dissipate storm surges and improve resilience against SLR effects.
   Significant co-benefits from mangroves also accrue, with 896 million
   metric tons of carbon stored in their soils and above- and below-ground
   biomass. Our framework offers a tool for prioritizing `hotspots' of
   coastal EbA potential for further, national and local analyses to
   quantify risk reduction and, thereby, guide investment in coastal
   ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change. In doing so, it
   underscores the global role that conserving and restoring ecosystems can
   play in protecting human lives and livelihoods, as well as biodiversity,
   in the face of climate change.},

Title = {An in situ method on kinetics of gas hydrates},
Journal = {REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Gas hydrate formation is a high-risk and common flow assurance problem
   in subsea oil production plants. The modern strategies to mitigate
   hydrate formation have switched from thermodynamic inhibition to risk
   management. In this new mitigation strategy, hydrate formation is
   allowed as long as it does not lead to plugging of pipelines. Thus,
   understanding the growth kinetics of gas hydrates plays a critical role
   in risk management strategies. Here, we report a new accurate and in
   situ approach to probe the kinetics of gas hydrate formation. This
   approach is based on the hot-wire method, which probes the thermal
   properties of the medium surrounding the hot-wire. As the thermal
   properties of gas hydrate and its initial constituents are different,
   variation in these properties is used to probe kinetics of hydrate
   growth front. Through this in situ method, we determine kinetics of
   cyclopentane hydrate formation in both mixing and flow conditions. The
   findings show that at ambient pressure and a temperature of 1-2 degrees
   C, the hydrate formation rate under mixing condition varies between 1.9
   x 10(-5) and 3.9 x 10(-5) kg m(-2) s(-1), while in flow condition, this
   growth rate drops to 4.5 x 10(-6) kg m(-2) s(-1). To our knowledge, this
   is the first reported growth rate of cyclopentane hydrate. This in situ
   approach allows us to probe kinetics of hydrate formation where there is
   no optical access and provides a tool to rationally design risk
   management strategies for subsea infrastructures. Published under

Abstract = {Climate change will affect communities in diverse and differentiated
   ways, so adaptation approaches must strive to address social justice in
   order to reduce inequality. This paper applies a social justice
   framework to examine planning for sea level rise in a densely populated
   coastal settlement in eastern Australia. The Lake Macquarie area is
   highly vulnerable to sea level rise with local adaptation planning
   already underway. An in-depth case study is presented that draws upon 19
   interviews with key informants and householders and a structured
   document and media analysis from 12 newspapers. This qualitative data
   was analysed to identify: the range of understandings of what is just in
   planning for sea level rise; and key factors that influence perceptions
   of justice in planned retreat scenarios. The study concludes that there
   is a need for guiding principles in decision-making that explicitly
   address social justice in order to realise more equitable outcomes.},

Abstract = {Sao Vicente Island (Republic of Cape Verde) lies within the Sahelian
   zone and faces several natural hazards, one of which is flash flooding.
   With the purpose of understanding what factors determine flash flood
   risk perception, a questionnaire entitled Flash Flood Hazard Perception
   in Cape Verde was applied to 199 subjects. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   was performed to identify the primary factors associated with the
   perception of flash flood risk. Differences between different groups
   under the same impact factor were also compared. The results indicated
   that certain socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents
   (gender, level of education, and type of housing) and prior experience
   correlated with flash flood risk perception. The study also shows
   statistical differences between the groups. In general, males and the
   respondents with a high level of education, homeowners, and people with
   prior experience have better perception of the flash flood risk. These
   findings can help decision makers to improve effective flash flood risk
   communication policies and flood risk reduction strategies.},

Abstract = {A numerical model accounting for variable density flow and transport was
   built up to quantify the actual and future (2050) salinization trends of
   a coastal aquifer in the Po delta (Northern Italy). SEAWAT 4.0 was
   employed to model the interaction between the surface drainage system
   and the underlying aquifer. PEST was employed for inverse parameter
   calibration using hydraulic heads and groundwater salinities as
   constraints. The calibrated model was used to predict the behavior of
   the coastal aquifer using a multiple scenario approach: increase in
   evapotranspiration induced by temperature increase; increase in the
   frequency of extreme high rainfall events; extreme drought conditions;
   and irrigation canals dewatering due to salinization of the Po River
   branches. For each scenario, two sub-scenarios were established to
   account for the projected local sea level rise. The first three
   scenarios have only minimal effects on the aquifer salinization, while
   the fourth forecasts a severe aquifer salinization due to enhanced
   upward fluxes of saline and hypersaline groundwater. The scenarios
   quantified the possible future salinization trends of groundwater and
   could be useful to identify adaptation strategies which allow to better
   manage water resources of this and similar areas. Results show that the
   Po delta will experience a significant salinization by 2050 and that the
   major cause is autonomous salinization via seepage of saline groundwater
   rather than enhanced salt-water intrusion due to sea level rise. The
   enhanced autonomous salinization will increase the salt export into the
   drainage canals that are also employed for irrigation, posing serious
   treats to the local flourishing agricultural economy. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Using a microclimate model to evaluate impacts of climate change on sea
   turtles},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {251},
Pages = {150-157},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Sea turtles are thought to be particularly vulnerable to climate change
   as projected increases in temperature may skew the sex ratio of their
   hatchlings, decrease hatchling success and thus threaten population
   persistence. Given the seriousness of the threat from climate change it
   is critical to understand the rate at which soil temperatures at sea
   turtles' nesting grounds are likely to change. This has stimulated the
   development of correlative models to assess and project how projected
   increases in temperature may impact sea turtle's reproductive output.
   Correlative models correlate climatic variables to soil temperature and
   hatchling sex ratio. These models have been widely used due to their
   simplicity and the flexibility of their data requirement. However,
   outputs are restricted by the environmental conditions used for the
   model and thus does not allow exploration of daily variation in sand
   temperature. Further, the potential error inherent in this approach has
   not been determined.
   Researchers working with other animals with temperature-dependent sex
   determination (TDS) have developed microclimate models to determine nest
   temperature and potential impacts from climate change. Microclimate
   models use the interaction between climate, soil, and topography with
   physiology and nesting behavior of animals to determine future
   production of hatchling sex ratios. Until now, microclimate models have
   never been applied to sea turtles and its correlation and consistency
   with correlative models has never been explored. To address this, we
   used the Niche Mapper (TM) microclimate model to project soil
   temperature at key sea turtle nesting grounds under various scenarios of
   global warming. Results from the microclimate model are compared to
   published projections from correlative models. The two approaches
   accurately and congruently model current soil temperature and project a
   feminization of the northern Great Barrier Reef green turtle population
   as climate change progresses. To provide guidance of when to use each
   approach we also reviewed the applicability and effectiveness of each
   model. The microclimate model provided a more robust picture of the
   incubating environment as it has the potential for projecting soil
   temperature for every hour of the day at various locations and depths
   within a nesting ground. This allows exploration of whether animals with
   TDS can counteract the impacts of global warming by changing nest depth
   and nesting distribution. With time and the validation of the
   microclimate model with short-term projections, the microclimate model
   can also be used to refine short-term adaptive management strategies as
   they can provide explicit recommendations on site-specific scales for
   translocation of eggs and alteration of the nesting environment. (C)

   (1) urban climate characteristics and variations in the GBA, including
   significant increase in average temperature, decrease in relative
   humidity and average wind speed, and more frequent extreme
   precipitation; (2) challenges brought by urban climate change to GBA,
   such as the meteorological conditions affecting the atmospheric
   environment have become more complex, the health risk of urban residents
   has increased, the risk of urban flash flood and waterlogging has
   increased, and the demand for urban energy consumption has also
   increased significantly; (3) technologies and strategies to mitigate and

   legal protection. In this study, the authors tested the influence of
   high greenery on the microclimatic conditions in the areas of typical
   street canyons (east-west and north-south orientations). Authors
   included the established greenery strategy by the City Planning
   Department. To estimate the impact of the assumed scenarios, a CFD tool
   was used-the ENVI-met application, which is commonly used in the field
   of urban microclimatology. Studies have shown that the introduction of
   10\% of green area contributed to a maximum air temperature reduction of
   0.80 degrees C (17:00) in an east-west-oriented canyon, 0.49 degrees C
   (10:00) in a north-south canyon. The scenarios, assumed by the City
   Planning Department, related to the introduction of a greater amount of
   greenery turned out to be a less effective solution. The impact of
   greenery on the thermal comfort felt by humans was also determined. The
   reduction in the PET index was a maximum of 10.80 degrees C (14:00) in
   an east-west canyon; 6.66 degrees C (14:00) in a canyon area with a
   north-south orientation. This research might constitute the foundations
   to a re-evaluation of the urban development plans. The outcomes can lead
   to taking alternative direction of city layout transformations.},

Title = {Governing for Integrated Water and Flood Risk Management: Comparing

Abstract = {Flood risk management in the context of Integrated Water Resource
   Management (IWRM) is becoming widely accepted as an approach to
   improving resilience in light of increasing flood risks due to climate
   change and other factors. This paper contributes to a better
   understanding of the governance arrangements needed for effectively
   implement integrated approaches to managing flood risk. We compare how
   IWRM and flood risk management have been operationalized within
   ``top-down{''} and ``bottom-up{''} governance arrangements in the
   European Union and the United States. We focus in particular on two case
   study regions, the Catalan coastal region in Spain and the San Francisco
   Bay Area in California, which have strong similarities in economy,
   climate, and environmental values, but different institutional settings.
   Our findings contribute empirical evidence of the need for a balance
   between ``top-down{''} and ``bottom-up{''} approaches. While the San
   Francisco Bay Area's strongly collaborative and participatory approach
   has generated new connections among flood managers and other
   stakeholders, the lack of a central entity with the capacity and mandate
   for on-going coordination and region-wide risk assessments appears to
   constrain its ability to support integrated and adaptive management. The
   European Union's top-down approach and the presence of a central
   authority at the river basin scale have led to a consolidated regional
   plan in Catalonia encompassing all phases of flood risk management, but
   the degree of engagement and opportunities for knowledge-sharing among
   participants may be more limited.},

Abstract = {Discarding non-target fish from commercial fisheries is controversial
   and has been a persistent concern for fisheries managers globally.
   Discard management strategies typically begin by understanding mortality
   rates among discarded fish, a challenging task given the dynamic, highly
   context-specific nature of fisheries. An alternative is to develop our
   knowledge of how stressors operate by first understanding the causes of
   mortality that drive this context dependence. Particularly relevant to
   mitigation efforts is an understanding of how fish respond to the
   physical factors of fishing, such as the gear itself and methods of
   fishing and handling the gear. We provide a synthesis of how commercial
   fishing methods may influence discard mortality and outline means by
   which capture-induced stress and injury can be mitigated for common
   commercial gear types, emphasizing method variants or alternatives
   during capture, handling, and release that could improve survival. This
   synthesis identifies exhaustion and injury as the most detrimental and
   ubiquitous stressors experienced by discarded fish, with few options for
   mitigating their effects. Trawls and hanging net fisheries are
   identified as the most harmful gears for by-catch, characterized by high
   stress regardless of method variants and limited options for mitigation.
   Irrespective of gear type and type of stressor, minimizing durations of
   capture and handling and encouragement of good handling behaviour (e.g.,
   during landing and sorting) will reduce the magnitude of stress and
   injury in fish, and ultimately increase survival.},

Abstract = {Large, abrupt, and widespread climate changes with major impacts have
   occurred repeatedly in the past, when the Earth system was forced across
   thresholds. Although abrupt climate changes can occur for many reasons,
   it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the
   probability of large, abrupt events. Were such an event to recur, the
   economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious.
   Unpredictability exhibited near climate thresholds in simple models
   shows that some uncertainty will always be associated with projections.
   In light of these uncertainties, policy-makers should consider expanding
   research into abrupt climate change, improving monitoring systems, and
   taking actions designed to enhance the adaptability and resilience of
   ecosystems and economies.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses multiple threats to biodiversity, and has already

   results in the context of commonly articulated hypotheses about
   ecosystem response to climate change for global implications. Specific
   impacts we consider include: range shifts; phenological shifts;
   phenotypic changes; primary production changes; biological invasions;
   and novel communities. Significant effort has been made recently to
   incorporate adaptation measures into land and water management at both
   national and international scales, but the scale of impacts and
   associated uncertainties pose challenges to existing management
   institutions. Using commonly articulated hypotheses about climate
   change, biodiversity, and ecosystem response can provide context for
   informed decisions at multiple scales and can help to provide a clearer
   understanding of the ecological and mechanistic linkages between climate
   change and biodiversity.},

Title = {Polycentricity and adaptive governance of transboundary marine
   socio-ecological systems},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {200},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Transboundary marine socio-ecological systems (SESs) are complex and
   dynamic systems. Enhancing the sustainability of such systems requires
   adaptive governance supported by polycentric structures. However,
   adaptive governance of marine SESs across national boundaries can be
   challenging, as significant differences in institutional arrangements
   for resource management and adaptive governance capabilities may exist.
   The limitations of various institutional arrangements and the challenges
   of adaptive governance across borders are still poorly understood. We
   offer a comparative study of two marine co-management systems, in
   southern Kenya and northern Tanzania, which are bound by different
   legislative environments to elucidate how institutions might limit or
   enable adaptive governance at the local and transboundary scale. The
   legislative environment is characterized based on a review of the
   literature. The structural properties of the co-management systems are
   examined for evidence of polycentricity using social network analysis.
   Across the different co-management contexts, we discover similar and
   distinct institutional opportunities and challenges for adaptive
   governance. Both co-management regimes foster the participation of
   diverse actors and multiple interactions. However, both show strong
   sectoral tendencies and high centrality of government, which can hinder
   adaptive governance. There are more autonomous decision units in
   Tanzania's co-management network, hence a more robust social context for
   polycentricism compared to Kenya. A shift towards enhanced
   polycentricity to foster adaptive governance of the Kenya-Tanzania
   transboundary marine SES will require policy frameworks that enhance
   cross-sectoral integration and create opportunities for
   multi-stakeholder bridging.},

Abstract = {Flood management decision-makers face significant challenges as the
   climate changes. The perceptions of those affected by floods are
   critical to the successful implementation of adaptation responses; risk
   perceptions are affected by how information is communicated and, in
   turn, perceptions influence expectations on flood risk managers to
   respond. The links between flood experience, risk perception, and
   responses by individual households were examined in the Hutt Valley, New
   Zealand, through a household survey, a workshop and interviews with
   local government practitioners. Two propositions were tested: (1) that
   flood experience can influence flood risk perceptions; and (2) that
   flood experience can stimulate increased risk reduction and adaptation
   actions where changing climate risk is likely. Perceptions of
   responsibility for flood management were also examined. The study found
   that previous flood experience contributes to heightened perception of
   risk, increased preparedness of households, greater willingness to make
   household-level changes, greater communication with councils, and more
   advocacy for spatial planning to complement existing structural
   protection. Flood-affected households had a stronger preference for
   central government and communities having flood risk responsibilities,
   in addition to local government. Those who lacked experience were more
   likely to be normalised to their prior benign experiences and thus
   optimistic about flood consequences. These results suggest that
   harnessing positive aspects of experience and communication of changing
   risk through engagement strategies could help shift the focus from
   citizens' expectation that governments will always provide protection,
   to a citizen-local government-central government dialogue about the
   changing character of flood risk and its implications, and build a `risk
   conscious' society in which `sharing and bearing' is considered
   desirable.},

Abstract = {A new geological epoch, the ``Anthropocene{''}, has been defined as the
   period in which humans have had substantial geological and ecological
   influence on the planet. A positive future for this epoch can be
   referred to as the ``good Anthropocene{''} and would involve effective
   management strategies and changes in human behavior that promote the
   sustainability and restoration of ecosystems. Recreational fisheries
   hold significant social, cultural, and economic value and can generate
   many benefits when managed sustainably and thus be an integral part of a
   ``good Anthropocene{''}. Here, we list ten commandments to facilitate
   persistence and long-term sustainability of recreational fisheries in
   the ``good Anthropocene{''}. This list includes fostering aquatic
   stewardship, promoting education, using appropriate capture gear,
   adopting evidence-based management approaches, promoting the concept of
   resilience, obtaining and using effort data in management, embracing the
   ecosystem approach, engaging in multilevel collaboration, enhancing
   accessibility, and embracing optimism. When used singly, or
   simultaneously, these ten commandments will contribute to the
   harmonization of sustainable fish populations and angling practices, to
   create recreational fisheries' ``bright spots{''}.},

Title = {Managing risks in the Indonesian seaweed supply chain},
Journal = {CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {175-189},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seaweed supply chains in Indonesia, especially carrageenan and agar
   products, are subject to risks arising both inside the participating
   companies and in their external networks. Uncertainties in yield,
   quality, price, and infrastructure in one part of the supply chain can
   affect the whole chain. To ensure a sustainable seaweed industry, an
   appropriate supply chain risk management (SCRM) is needed. There are
   four critical steps in SCRM: identifying seaweed supply chains,
   identifying and categorizing risks, assessing risks, and mitigating
   risks. To identify seaweed supply chains, we conducted field research,
   in-depth interviews, and literature studies. The field survey was
   conducted in the Provinces of South Sulawesi, West Java, East Java,
   Banten, and West Nusa Tenggara. The seaweed supply chains were modeled
   by the software Umberto to get a better understanding of material and
   energy flows between the key members. To identify and categorize the
   risks, we started with the risks mentioned in the existing literature
   works, and then applied the Delphi method to analyze the potential risk
   sources, their causes, and their impacts. To assess risks, we used a
   semiquantitative approach through the face-to-face interviews to
   generate a risk map showing the likelihood, and impact of adverse
   events. Afterward, the risk intensity was categorized based on the value
   of the responses and classified into five categories: negligible,
   marginal, critical, most critical, and catastrophic risks. The
   mitigation strategies considered sustainability (environment, economy,
   and social) and risks criteria. Multi-criteria decision analysis was
   used to evaluate these strategies.},

Title = {Measuring Household Resilience to Cyclone Disasters in Coastal
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to measure the level of household
   resilience to cyclone and storm surges in the coastal area of
   Bangladesh. We draw on four general disaster frameworks in terms of
   addressing household-level resilience to cyclones and storm surges. We
   use a composite indicator approach organized around four components: (1)
   household infrastructure (HI); (2) household economic capacity (HEC);
   (3) household self-organization and learning (HSoL), and; (4) social
   safety nets (SSN). Drawing on a household survey (N = 1188) in nine
   coastal union parishads in coastal Bangladesh purposively selected as
   among the most vulnerable places in the world, we use principal
   components analysis applied to a standardized form of the survey data
   that identifies key household resilience features. These household index
   scores can be used for the assessment and monitoring of household
   capacities, training, and other efforts to improve household cyclone
   resilience. Our innovative methodological approach allows us to (a)
   identify patterns and reveal the underlying factors that accurately
   describe the variation in the data; (b) reduce a large number of
   variables to a much smaller number of core dimensions of household
   resilience, and (c) to detect spatial variations in resilience among
   communities. Aggregated to the community level, our new index reveals
   significant differences in community cyclone resilience in different
   areas of the coastal region. In this way, we can show that shoreline and
   island communities, in particular, have significant deficits in terms of
   household resilience, which seem to be mutually reinforcing one another
   and making for lower resilience.},

Abstract = {The variation and trend in the frequency and duration of four types of
   high-impact weather (HIW) events were examined using daily surface
   climate data and linear regression method, and results show that for
   both the frequency and the duration, the trends of hot weather events
   were not significant in most parts of China, though for the China as a
   whole, they had increased with rates of 0.4 days and 0.1 spells of hot
   weather per decade respectively. The frequency of cold weather events
   had decreased significantly in most parts of China, particularly in
   northern, northeastern, and western China, where it increased at rates
   of 2-8 days per decade in most stations, but the duration of cold
   weather events were not significant in most parts of China. The
   frequency of gale weather events had decreased in almost all of China,
   with a rate of 3.7 days per decade for the China as a whole, and the
   duration of gale weather events had decreased mainly in northeastern and
   northern China, western Xinjiang, southwestern Sichuan, and some coastal
   areas of Liaoning, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Fujian. The frequency of
   rainstorm weather events was not significant in most parts of China, and
   the duration of rainstorm weather events was not significant in the
   whole of China. With global climate change, there would be an increase
   in the hot and rainstorm weather events, so mitigation/adaptation
   strategies for such weather events are essential for local government
   and social public.},

Title = {The future of Caribbean tourism: competition and climate change
   implications},
Journal = {WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {44-59},
Abstract = {Purpose - This conceptual paper examines the Caribbean tourism sector,
   its growth, performance, importance and its vulnerability to climate
   change. The purpose of this paper is to serve as an introduction to the
   on-going conversation around climate change and the socioeconomic
   impacts likely to be experienced in tourism-dependent Caribbean
   territories.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Caribbean is used as the context of
   this work. A broad perspective was adopted to paint a picture of the
   wider implications. The region is represented by a multiplicity of
   country profiles, both in physical and socio-economic characteristics;
   this warrants a broad assessment of the issues examined here.
   Findings - This work shows that the Caribbean tourism sectors face
   significant future threats related to both competitiveness and climate
   change impacts. For a region so heavily dependent on coastal-and
   marine-related tourism attractions, adaptation and resilience are
   critical issues facing Caribbean tourism. An effective approach to
   building resilience to climate change requires extensive regional
   cooperation.
   Research limitations/implications - While there is much published on the
   matter of climate change implications in the general global context,
   there is considerably less published work specifically examining the
   likely effects climate change will have on the special socio-economic
   features of the Caribbean and on the tourism industry in particular.
   Practical implications - The lack of extensive and ongoing research
   dedicated to climate change implications for Caribbean tourism, while
   limiting the scope of this work, does highlight a gap and open the door
   for future work that examines, in greater detail both collectively and
   on an individual country basis, the climate change implications for
   tourism industries throughout the region.
   Social implications - Climate change vulnerabilities in the region
   present a significant threat to economic development, employment and
   food security among others. Coastal flooding, infrastructural damage and
   the potential displacement of coastal communities present significant
   impediments to the quality of life of Caribbean nationals. The social
   implications necessitate further in-depth study to inform the
   development of adaptation strategies that may secure the tourism
   industry and the livelihoods and lifestyles of the people.
   Originality/value - This work is original in its evaluation of the
   viewpoints of climate change vulnerability specific to the Caribbean
   tourism sector.},

Title = {An integrative approach to planning for community-based adaptation to
   sea-level rise in Thailand},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {This paper outlines an integrative process for community-based
   adaptation plans to sea-level rise (SLR) effects in Kohklang
   Sub-district, Thailand. Three objectives guide this research: (1) to
   identify flood prone areas and develop a coastal vulnerability index
   (CVI) (e.g., to estimate ecosystem service impacts and economic loss in
   flood prone areas); (2) to co-develop risk profiles and social
   vulnerability assessment; and (3) to synthesize assessment outcomes and
   generate corresponding adaptation plans and recommendations. A knowledge
   coproduction process was used to link participatory action research
   (PAR) on social conditions and changes with technical assessments of
   sea-level rise simulations at 0.5 and 1 m to identify flood prone areas
   and develop the CVI. Additional data collection and analyses methods
   include a review of literature and synthesis of expert opinion (n = 5)
   regarding SLR effects on estimated losses in ecosystem services and
   community livelihoods, semistructured interviews (n = 50) and focus
   group discussions (n = 17 people). We find that a co-production process
   of natural and social science, together with local knowledge, provides a
   holistic and integrative identification of impacts of sea level rise and
   community-based adaptation plans and policy. Initial results were
   synthesized and then presented to multiple stakeholders in a Kohklang
   community workshop to further clarify findings and confirm insights.
   This research process has highlighted the significance of

Abstract = {We examined the phenology of 2 amphibians (common frog Rana temporaria,
   common toad Bufo bufo) and one resident bird species (blackbird Turdus
   merula) at locations in Poland and in the UK on similar latitudes. The
   timing of phenology was earlier in the UK than in Poland, presumably as
   a consequence of a warmer maritime environment. This was further
   confirmed by the earlier frog spawn phenology in the warmer west of the
   UK than in the east. In the amphibians, the response to temperature was
   significantly greater in the UK than in Poland, although for the
   resident bird species the greater response in the UK did not achieve
   significance. These results suggest that species are adapted to local
   conditions. However if such adaptive strategies are not able to evolve
   rapidly to match rapidly changing climatic conditions, then severe
   disruption to the least flexible elements in any system may result.},

Title = {Restoring Coastal Plants to Improve Global Carbon Storage: Reaping What
   We Sow},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently considered a
   viable strategy for mitigating rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and
   associated impacts of global climate change. Until recently, the
   significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such as
   seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves has largely gone unrecognized in
   models of global carbon transfer. However, this reservoir of natural,
   free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly
   jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling
   30-50\% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human
   intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution
   to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach
   is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current
   restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale. Failure to do
   so raises the question of whether resources currently used for expensive
   and time-consuming restoration projects would be more wisely invested in
   arresting further habitat loss and encouraging natural recovery.},

Title = {Novel climates in European river sub-basins pose a challenge for the
   persistence of freshwater fish},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {830},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Understanding how climate change would affect biota inhabiting sensitive
   and highly valuable ecosystems, spanning broad regions, is essential to
   anticipate implications for biodiversity and humans, and to identify
   management and mitigation measures. Traditionally, assessments to
   evaluate climatic risks over broad regions and for many species
   implement models that allow the projection of a climate-driven
   redistribution of biodiversity. Still, the wealth and quality of the
   background information (e.g., species presence data) constrain the
   accuracy and representativeness of such frameworks. As an alternative,
   here, we developed a twofold approach to assess the vulnerability of 86
   European freshwater fish. We accounted for shifts in a multidimensional
   climatic space of broader hydrological units that host freshwater bodies
   in Europe. We then linked metrics of their climatic stability with
   groups of species, which were generated from six intrinsic traits that
   shape species adaptive capacity to climate change. Our results
   demonstrated that the climate of all (n = 538) river sub-basins hosted
   in the European Union territory would change by 2100, with more than
   10\% of them being projected to gain completely novel climates.
   Sub-basins predicted to lose more than 90\% of their current climatic
   space were mainly identified in the area around the Baltic Sea, but also
   in Mediterranean regions (i.e., Iberian Peninsula). Important numbers of
   fish species with life history strategies that are considered
   susceptible to climate change were identified in sub-basins that were
   predicted to completely lose their current climatic conditions. Clearly,
   the climate of valuable freshwater ecosystems is changing, affecting
   species and their communities in varying ways. The risk is high, and is
   not limited to specific regions; thus, new effective strategies and
   measures are needed to conserve freshwater fish and their habitats
   across Europe.},

   weather events},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {100},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study sheds light on the coupling of potential flood risk and
   drainage infrastructure resilience of low-lying areas of a coastal urban
   watershed to evaluate flood hazards and their possible driving forces.
   Copulas analyses with the aid of joint probability of simultaneous
   occurrence help characterize the complexity for hazard classification
   based on subsequent exposure to inundation under varying levels of
   adaptive capacity. Adaptive measures of consideration include
   traditional flood proofing structures and low impact development
   facilities for a coastal urban watershed - the Cross Bayou watershed,
   near Tampa Bay, Florida. Findings indicate that coupling flood risk and
   infrastructure resilience is achievable through the careful formulation
   of flood risk associated with a resilience metric, which is a function
   of the predicted hazards, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. The
   results also give insights into improving existing methodologies for
   municipalities in flood management practices such as incorporating a
   multicriteria flood impact assessment that couples risk and resilience
   in a common evaluation framework. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Assessing the adaptive capacity of farmers under the impact of saltwater

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1619-1635},
Abstract = {Saltwater intrusion is one of the main problems in the coastal provinces
   in the Mekong Delta (including the Tra Vinh province), and it is
   becoming more severe with climate change and rising sea levels. In the
   face of this problem, a strategic plan has been developed for the
   Vietnamese Mekong Delta that suggests adapting to increasing salinity
   levels. However, the farmers' capacity to implement the changes is
   unclear. The objective of this study was to assess farmers' adaptive
   capacities towards saline intrusion in the Tra Vinh province in order to
   provide appropriate adaptation options, using the MOTA
   (Motivation-Ability) approach. This study surveyed 187 farmers regarding
   their perception, motivation, and ability in different saline
   environments in the study area, including three regions: seawater areas
   (region 1), brackish water areas (region 2), and freshwater areas
   (region 3). The results showed that farmers have quite high perceptions
   of salinity intrusion, especially farmers who live in areas affected by
   it. Regarding the level of saltwater intrusion, the farmers' motivation
   in all three regions had a negative score, which indicates their
   motivation for adapting to increased salinity was quite low.
   Additionally, the farmers' adaptive capacities in all three regions were
   moderate, with lowest capacities in educational level and rate of
   participation in non-agricultural organizations. The study results may
   be useful for managers and policy-makers in proposing appropriate and
   feasible options for implementing an adaptation plan to ensure
   sustainable livelihoods for local farmers.},

Title = {Potential suitable habitat of Eleusine coracana (L) gaertn (Finger
   millet) under the climate change scenarios in Nepal},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Background Finger millet is the fourth major crop in Nepal and is
   cultivated in a traditional integrated subsistence system. Timely rain
   and appropriate temperature predominately affects crop distribution and
   yield. Climate change is evident in Nepal and it is imperative to
   understand how it affects habitat suitability of finger millet. Main
   objective of this study was to map the current suitable habitat and
   predicting the potential changes in the future under different climate
   scenarios in Nepal. Habitat mapping is important for maximizing
   production and minimizing the loss of local landraces. Results Maxent
   model was used in this study to quantify the current suitable habitat
   and changes in the future habitat suitability of finger millet, based on
   representative concentration pathways (RCP) (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5)
   in two different time periods (2050 and 2070AD) using climatic
   predictive variables and species localities. The model shows that 39.7\%
   (58512.71 km(2)) area of Nepal is highly suitable for finger millet,
   with cultivation mostly between 96 and 2300 m above sea level. Eastern
   and central parts of Nepal have more suitable areas than western parts.
   Our research clearly shows that the future climatic suitable area of
   finger millet would shrink by 4.3 to 8.9\% in 2050 and 8.9-10.5\% under
   different RCPs by 2070. Conclusion Finger millet is mostly cultivated in
   mid-hill terraces. The substantial increase in temperature due to
   climate change may be one reason for decrease in habitat suitability of
   finger millet. This situation would further threat loss of local
   landraces of finger millet in the future. The findings can help in
   planning and policy framing for climate resilient smart agriculture
   practice.},

Abstract = {Global increase of urban population has brought about a growing demand
   for more dwelling space, resulting in various negative impacts, such as
   accelerated urbanization, urban sprawl and higher carbon footprints. To
   cope with these growth dynamics, city authorities are urged to consider
   alternative planning strategies aiming at mitigating the negative
   implications of urbanization. In this context, the present contribution
   investigates the potential of urban densification to mitigate the heat
   island effects and to improve outdoor thermal conditions. Focusing on a
   quite densely urbanized district in Vienna, Austria, we carried out a
   set of simulations of urban microclimate for pre- and post-densification
   scenarios using the parametric modelling environment Rhinoceros 3D and a
   set of built-in algorithms in the Rhino's plug-in Grasshopper. The study
   was conducted for a hot summer period. The results revealed a notable
   solar shielding effect of newly introduced vertical extensions of
   existing buildings, promoting temperature decrease and improved thermal
   conditions within more shaded urban canyons and courtyards. However, a
   slight warming effect was noted during the night-time due to the higher
   thermal storage and lower sky view factor.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) is not just a future trend; it is occurring now in
   most coastal regions across the globe. It thus impacts not only
   long-range planning in coastal environments, but also emergency
   preparedness. Its inevitability and irreversibility on long time scales,
   in addition to its spatial non-uniformity, uncertain magnitude and
   timing, and capacity to drive non-stationarity in coastal flooding on
   planning and engineering timescales, create unique challenges for
   coastal risk-management decision processes. This review assesses past
   United States federal efforts to synthesize evolving SLR science in
   support of coastal risk management. In particular, it outlines the: (1)
   evolution in global SLR scenarios to those using a risk-based
   perspective that also considers low-probability but high-consequence
   outcomes, (2) regionalization of the global scenarios, and (3) use of
   probabilistic approaches. It also describes efforts to further
   contextualize regional scenarios by combining local mean sea-level
   changes with extreme water level projections. Finally, it offers
   perspectives on key issues relevant to the future uptake,
   interpretation, and application of sea-level change scenarios in
   decision-making. These perspectives have utility for efforts to craft
   standards and guidance for preparedness and resilience measures to
   reduce the risk of coastal flooding and other impacts related to SLR.},

Abstract = {As many crops are sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation,
   agriculture is especially vulnerable to climate events. This may prove
   critical in tropical regions where most agriculture is in rain-fed
   systems and climate change may have a potentially large influence on
   productivity. By adversely affecting food and water resources, climate
   change thus threatens progress and efforts made in poverty reduction,
   economic growth, and achievement of further Millennium Development
   Goals, such as ending hunger on our planet and achieving environmental
   sustainability.
   The intensification of food production transformed formerly small-scale
   traditional systems to modern large-scale monocultures, e.g. in Latin
   America. However, banana monoculture production by smallholders is also
   found in many parts of the world, for example in countries such as St
   Lucia, which is a major banana-producing country in the Caribbean
   Windward Islands.
   Mono-cropping farmers increasingly need to deal with the fact that modem
   intensive agricultural systems which are characterized by increased need
   for fertilizers and irrigation, i.e. nutrients and water, may become
   more sensitive to climate change in tern-is of lower productivity,
   higher vulnerability, and reduced sustainability in the future.
   Moreover, food systems in developing countries are currently
   experiencing enormous organizational changes, reflected in the ongoing
   reorganization of supply chains, ranging from farm to fork. Being at the
   end of the chain, particularly the small-scale producers have to cope
   with global consumers' demands, reflected in the necessity to deliver
   high-quality products on time and at competitive prices. These high
   requirements can represent a serious barrier to small farmers'
   participation in higher value chains, e.g. in the Caribbean Island of St
   Lucia. St. Lucia's farmers therefore need to diversify their production,
   e.g. by adopting fair trade production standards, and tap new domestic
   as well as niche markets by means of improved commercialization to
   sustain food security and poverty reduction endeavors.
   Considering that small island developing states like St Lucia, where
   agriculture still represents the backbone of a society increasingly have
   to face these two global challenges - globalized markets and climate
   change - and recognize their impacts already today, this paper will
   explore the future impacts of climate change on the Caribbean region,
   discuss the potential impacts of climate change for smallholder
   agriculture in St Lucia, and elaborate on the importance of information,
   training and capacity building, not only in terms of improved
   diversification and commercialization of agricultural produce, but also
   for raising the adaptive capacity of small-scale farmers in St Lucia by
   providing sustainable adaptation options for farm-level diversification
   in the light of climate change.},

   due to Global Warming},

Abstract = {Knowledge of regional differences in future climate projections is
   important for effective adaptation strategies. Extreme events often
   arise regionally, but multiscale factors likely act together. Hence, we
   need discussion of multiple scales for the regional characteristics of
   future changes of extremes. In this study, using a large ensemble
   climate simulation database (d4PDF) created by global and regional
   climate models, the change in the temperature extreme defined as the top
   10\% of summertime daily maximum temperature in Japan is investigated
   under a globally 2- and 4-K-warmer climate, with emphasis on its
   regionality. Under global warming, the increase in extremely high
   temperature has a different spatial distribution from that of mean
   temperature. A simple composite analysis of extreme events shows that
   the high temperature occurs under a site-specific spatial pattern of sea
   level pressure (SLP), with a common feature of a warm anomaly up to the
   upper troposphere over the sites. The SLP pattern reflects the local
   topography and favors a foehnlike wind that increases the near-surface
   temperature. The impact of climate change in SLP on the foehn-inducing
   pattern varies with site, leading to regional differences in
   high-temperature changes. Therefore, the dynamic response of SLP to
   global warming results in a characteristic spatial distribution for the
   high-temperature change, which differs from the distribution for the
   mean-temperature change that generally shows the thermodynamic response.
   The characteristic is expected to appear in mountainous regions of the
   world, and this study helps in understanding future projections of high
   temperature there. Significance StatementRegionality in future climate
   projections strongly influences the usefulness of adaptation strategies
   to climate change. This study indicates that the increase in extremely
   high temperature has a different spatial distribution from that of mean
   temperature. A site-specific spatial pattern of sea level pressure (SLP)
   reflecting the local topography contributes to the location of high
   temperature via a foehnlike wind. The impact of climate change in SLP on
   the pattern varies with site and leads to the regionality in
   high-temperature changes, which is the dynamic response to global
   warming unlike the thermodynamic response appearing on the
   mean-temperature change. This study helps us to understand future
   projections of temperature extreme in mountainous regions and their
   surroundings around the world.},

Journal = {FACETS},

Volume = {6},

Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Many barriers to behavioural change exist when it comes to climate
   change action. A key element to overcoming some of these barriers is
   effective communication of complex scientific information. The use of
   visualizations, such as photographs or interactive maps, can increase
   knowledge dissemination, helping community members understand climatic
   and environmental changes. These techniques have been utilized in many
   disciplines but have not been widely embraced by climate change
   scholars. This paper discusses the utility of climate change data
   visualization as a tool for climate change knowledge mobilization. This
   paper draws on the case studying drivers of coastline change of Lake
   Ontario in the Town of Lincoln, Ontario, Canada. Historical aerial
   photographs were used to measure the rate of coastline change and
   visualize vulnerable sections of the coast. To better visualize the
   changes that occurred over time from a resident viewpoint, selected
   land-based historical photographs were replicated by taking new
   photographs at the same locations. These visualization tools can be
   useful to support the community in developing strategies to adapt to
   climate change by increasing understanding of the changes and knowledge
   through social learning. These tools can be generalized to other case
   studies dealing with community engagement in coastal adaptation efforts.

   The Covenant of Mayors Initiative in the Small Island State of Malta},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {159},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is an initiative that voluntarily engages
   municipalities to devise local policies to reduce CO2 emissions and
   energy consumption. The progress of the CoM in Malta and Gozo is
   evaluated; evidence suggests that signatories have not sufficiently
   fulfilled their obligations to the initiative and there has been little
   contribution of the CoM to the local reduction of CO2 emissions and
   energy consumption for the 2020 set of targets for Malta. Overall, it
   was noted that local councils have not had sufficient autonomy,
   resources and external support to enable their successful participation
   in the initiative. The barriers experienced by Maltese signatories have
   been identified as ineffective communication and lack of resident
   engagement. With the large potential for local governments to contribute
   towards climate change mitigation and adaptation, certain policy
   recommendations are made to improve the effectiveness of local
   governments' involvement in climate policies and initiatives. These
   measures focus on the financing of local councils, organisational and
   accountability procedures, prioritisation of climate action, outreach
   and involvement of the general public, and continued awareness raising
   of climate issues.},

Abstract = {The prospects of rapid climate change and the potential existence of
   tipping points in marine ecosystems where nonlinear change may result
   from them being overstepped, raises the question of strategies for
   coping with ecosystem change. There is broad agreement that the combined
   forces of climate change, pollution and increasing economic activities
   necessitates more comprehensive approaches to oceans management,
   centering on the concept of ecosystem-based oceans management. This
   article addresses the Norwegian experience in introducing integrated,
   ecosystem-based oceans management, emphasizing how climate change, seen
   as a major long-term driver of change in ecosystems, is addressed in
   management plans. Understanding the direct effects of climate
   variability and change on ecosystems and indirect effects on human
   activities is essential for adaptive planning to be useful in the
   long-term management of the marine environment.},

Abstract = {The current study examines gaps between climate change and rapid
   urbanisation sub-Saharan Africa. Through a combined analysis of remotely
   sensed and meteorological data, the study revealed the extent of urban
   microclimate change trends within a few decades. Thus, upward changes in
   microclimate ? temperature of nearly 2?C was witnessed in 2018 (27.7?C)
   against 25.9?C of 1980s. Whereas, the city expanded from 39.2?km(2) in
   1986 to 256 km(2) in 2018. These changes witnessed in urban form and
   climate are attributed to rapid urban expansion and poor planning system
   that fails to preserve and protect the city?s green and blue
   infrastructure. The picture of the situation in Kano gives insights into
   the enormous challenges before cities in developing world to cope with
   local and global climate change risks. Indeed, this situation calls for
   an integrated approach to addressing climate change from within and
   without cities themselves. It is imperative on policymakers to increase
   expenditure on urban planning, financing adaptation strategies through
   urban planning, and strengthening of institutions of urban planning.},

Abstract = {Climate change may affect ocean-driven coastal flooding regimes by both
   raising the mean sea level (msl) and altering ocean-atmosphere
   interactions. For reliable projections of coastal flood risk,
   information provided by different climate models must be considered in
   addition to associated uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a
   framework to project future coastal water levels and quantify the
   resulting flooding hazard to infrastructure. We use Bayesian Model
   Averaging to generate a weighted ensemble of storm surge predictions
   from eight climate models for two coastal counties in California. The
   resulting ensembles combined with msl projections, and predicted
   astronomical tides are then used to quantify changes in the likelihood
   of road flooding under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5
   in the near-future (1998-2063) and mid-future (2018-2083). The results
   show that road flooding rates will be significantly higher in the
   near-future and mid-future compared to the recent past (1950-2015) if
   adaptation measures are not implemented.},

Title = {How to communicate climate change `impact and solutions' to vulnerable
   population of Indian Sundarbans? From theory to practice},
Journal = {SPRINGERPLUS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {Introduction: Global consciousness on climate change problems and
   adaptation revolves around the disparity of information sharing and
   communication gap between theoretical scientific knowledge at academic
   end and practical implications of these at the vulnerable populations'
   end. Coastal communities facing socio-economic stress, like densely
   populated Sundarbans, are the most affected part of the world, exposed
   to climate change problems and uncertainties. This article explores the
   successes of a socio-environmental project implemented at Indian
   Sundarbans targeted towards economic improvement and aims at
   communicating environmental conservation through organized community
   participation.
   Case description: Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and the wealth
   rank tool (WRT) were used to form a ``group based organization{''} with
   2100 vulnerable families to give them knowledge about capacity building,
   disaster management, resource conservation and sustainable agriculture
   practices. Training was conducted with the selected group members on
   resource conservation, institution building, alternative income
   generation activities (AIGA) like, Poultry, Small business, Tricycle
   van, Organic farming and disaster management in a participatory mode.
   The climate change `problems-solutions' were communicated to this
   socio-economically marginalized and ostracized community through
   participatory educational theater (PET).
   Discussion and evaluation: WRT revealed that 45 \% of the population was
   under economic stress. Out of 2100 beneficiaries', 1015 beneficiaries'
   started organic farming, 133 beneficiaries' adopted poultry instead of
   resource exploitive livelihood and 71 beneficiaries' engaged themselves
   with small business, which was the success stories of this project. To
   mitigate disaster, 10-committees were formed and the endemic knowledge
   about climate change was recorded by participatory method validated
   through survey by structured questionnaire. As a part of this project 87
   ha of naked deforested mudflat was reclaimed with endangered mangroves
   involving target community members aimed to sequester CO2, control soil
   erosion and act as a barrier during natural disasters.
   Conclusion: This case study concluded that participatory method of
   communication, aiming not only to communicate theoretical knowledge, but
   also to devise adaptation strategies through conservation of endemic
   knowledge, popularizing sustainability through Micro Finance
   Institutions and promoting AIGA along with motivating vulnerable
   community to restore degraded forest lands, could be a effective
   solution to practically combat climate change problems.},

Title = {Thinking beyond organism energy use: a trait-based bioenergetic
   mechanistic approach for predictions of life history traits in marine

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The functional trait-based bioenergetic approach is emergent in many
   ecological spectra, from the conservation of natural resources to
   mitigation and adaptation strategies in a global climate change context.
   Such an approach relies on being able to exploit mechanistic rules to
   connect environmental human-induced variability to functional traits
   (i.e. all those specific traits defining species in terms of their
   ecological roles) and use these to provide estimates of species life
   history traits (LH; e. g. body size, fecundity per life span, number of
   reproductive events). LHs are species-specific and proximate
   determinants of population characteristics in a certain habitat. They
   represent the most valuable quantitative information to investigate how
   broad potential distributional boundaries of a species are, and to feed
   predictive population models. There is much to be found in the current
   literature that describes mechanistic functional trait-based
   bioenergetics models, using them to test ecological hypotheses, but a
   mathematical framework often renders interpretation and use complicated.
   Here, we wanted to present a simpler interpretation and description of
   one of the most important recent mechanistic bioenergetic theories: the
   dynamic energy budget theory by Kooijman (Dynamic Energy Budget Theory
   for Metabolic Organisation, 2010, Cambridge University Press,
   Cambridge). Our main aim was to disentangle those aspects that at first
   reading may seem too mathematically challenging to many marine
   biologists, ecologists and environmental scientists, and present them
   for use in mechanistic applications.},

   order to carry out a comprehensive impact study, the involvement of
   stakeholders in the planning and execution of the study is seen as a
   necessary prerequisite for an acceptance of its conclusions by the broad
   public. One way to pursue such an involvement is through a

   institutionalized through a joint scientist-stakeholder steering
   committee addressing issues related to mutual communication and the
   integration of individual study results, offers a number of additional
   advantages. The experience of local residents and the utilization of
   traditional knowledge may provide insight and expertise inaccessible to
   scientific investigations. Within the Barents Sea Impact Study, the
   involvement of stakeholders has been given significant weight early on.
   One of the main instruments employed in the stakeholder collaborative is
   the BASIS Information Office. However, given the diversity of
   backgrounds and interests of stakeholders from four different countries,
   scientist-stakeholder collaboration represents a significant challenge
   within BASIS. This notwithstanding, we consider the advantages gained

Abstract = {Forestry and peat land including land-based is one of the critical
   sectors in the inventory of CO2 emissions and mitigation efforts of
   climate change. The present study analyzed the land-use and land-cover
   changes between 2006 and 2012 in North Sumatra, Indonesia with emphasis
   to CO2 emissions. The land-use/land-cover consists of twenty-one
   classes. Redd Abacus software version 1.1.7 was used to measure carbon
   emission source as well as the predicted (2)carbon dioxide emissions
   from 2006-2024. Results showed that historical emission (2006-2012) in
   this province, significant increases in the intensive land use namely
   dry land agriculture (109.65\%), paddy field (16.23\%) and estate
   plantation (15.11\%). On the other hand, land-cover for forest decreased
   significantly: secondary dry land forest (7.60\%), secondary mangrove
   forest (9.03\%), secondary swamp forest (33.98\%), and the largest one
   in the mixed dry land agriculture (79.96\%). The results indicated that
   North Sumatra province is still a CO2 emitter, and the most important
   driver of emissions mostly derived from agricultural lands that
   contributed (2)carbon dioxide emissions by 48.8\%, changing from forest
   areas into degraded lands (classified as barren land and shrub) shared
   30.6\% and estate plantation of 22.4\%. Mitigation actions to reduce
   carbon emissions was proposed such as strengthening the forest land,
   rehabilitation of degraded area, development and plantation forest,
   forest protection and forest fire control, and reforestation and
   conservation activity. These mitigation actions have been simulated to
   reduce 15\% for forestry and 18\% for peat land, respectively. This data
   is likely to contribute to the low emission development in North
   Sumatra.},

Title = {Large-scale redistribution of maximum fisheries catch potential in the

Abstract = {Previous projection of climate change impacts on global food supply
   focuses solely on production from terrestrial biomes, ignoring the large
   contribution of animal protein from marine capture fisheries. Here, we
   project changes in global catch potential for 1066 species of exploited
   marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change
   scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale
   redistribution of global catch potential, with an average of 30-70\%
   increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40\% in the
   tropics. Moreover, maximum catch potential declines considerably in the
   southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward
   tips of continental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the
   Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic
   Zone (EEZ) regions in terms of their total landings, EEZ regions with
   the highest increase in catch potential by 2055 include Norway,
   Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the
   contrary, EEZ regions with the biggest loss in maximum catch potential
   include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii),
   Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the
   tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our
   results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could
   minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also
   provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management
   options under climate change.},

Abstract = {In this study, a mixed integer fuzzy interval-stochastic programming
   model was developed for supporting the improvement of eco-resilience to
   floods in wetlands. This method allows uncertainties that are associated
   with eco-resilience improvement and can be presented as both probability
   distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general
   modeling framework. Also, capacity-expansion plans of eco-resilience can
   be addressed through introducing binary variables. Moreover, penalties
   due to ecological damages which are associated with the violation of
   predefined targets can be effectively incorporated within the modeling
   and decision process. Thus, complexities associated with flood
   resistance and eco-resilience planning in wetlands can be systematically
   reflected, highly enhancing robustness of the modeling process. The
   developed method was then applied to a case of eco-resilience
   enhancement planning in three ecologically vulnerable regions of a
   wetland. Interval solutions under different river flow levels and
   different ecological damages were generated. They could be used for
   generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify
   desired eco-resilience schemes to resist floods without causing too much
   damages. The application indicates that the model is helpful for
   supporting: (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of
   ecological flood-resisting capacities, (b) formulation of local policies
   regarding eco-resilience enhancement options and policy interventions,
   and (c) analysis of interactions among multiple administrative targets
   within a wetland. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Integrating Environmental and Socio-Economic Indicators of a Linked
   Catchment-Coastal System Using Variable Environmental Intensity},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {484-493},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Can we develop land use policy that balances the conflicting views of
   stakeholders in a catchment while moving toward long term
   sustainability? Adaptive management provides a strategy for this whereby
   measures of catchment performance are compared against performance goals
   in order to progressively improve policy. However, the feedback loop of
   adaptive management is often slow and irreversible impacts may result
   before policy has been adapted. In contrast, integrated modelling of
   future land use policy provides rapid feedback and potentially improves
   the chance of avoiding unwanted collapse events. Replacing measures of
   catchment performance with modelled catchment performance has usually
   required the dynamic linking of many models, both biophysical and
   socio-economic-and this requires much effort in software development. As
   an alternative, we propose the use of variable environmental intensity
   (defined as the ratio of environmental impact over economic output) in a
   loose coupling of models to provide a sufficient level of integration
   while avoiding significant effort required for software development.
   This model construct was applied to the Motueka Catchment of New Zealand
   where several biophysical (riverine water quantity, sediment, E. coli
   faecal bacteria, trout numbers, nitrogen transport, marine productivity)
   models, a socio-economic (gross output, gross margin, job numbers)
   model, and an agent-based model were linked. An extreme set of land use
   scenarios (historic, present, and intensive) were applied to this
   modelling framework. Results suggest that the catchment is presently in
   a near optimal land use configuration that is unlikely to benefit from
   further intensification. This would quickly put stress on water quantity
   (at low flow) and water quality (E. coli). To date, this model
   evaluation is based on a theoretical test that explores the logical
   implications of intensification at an unlikely extreme in order to
   assess the implications of likely growth trajectories from present use.
   While this has largely been a desktop exercise, it would also be
   possible to use this framework to model and explore the biophysical and
   economic impacts of individual or collective catchment visions. We are
   currently investigating the use of the model in this type of
   application.},

Abstract = {Cholera remains a heavy burden worldwide, especially in Sub-Saharan
   African countries, which account for the majority of the reported cases
   on the continent. In this study, a 27-year retrospective analysis of
   cholera epidemics in Guinea-Bissau was performed in order to highlight
   major stressors fueling the trigger and dissemination of the disease.
   Although the role of environmental factors did not always have the same
   degree of importance for the onset of epidemics, a cholera seasonal
   pattern was clearly perceived, with most of the reported cases occurring
   during the wet season. The generated theoretical hypothesis indicated
   rainfall above climatological average, associated with a lack of WASH
   (water, sanitation and hygiene) infrastructure, and the occurrence of
   concomitant epidemics in neighboring countries as the key indicators for
   optimal conditions for cholera to thrive in Guinea-Bissau. Warmer air
   temperature, the increase in sea surface temperature, and the decrease
   in salinity in the coastal areas may also contribute to the emergence
   and/or aggravation of cholera events. Prediction of the conditions
   favorable for cholera growth and identification of risk pathways will
   allow the timely allocation of resources, and support the development of
   alert tools and mitigation strategies.},

Title = {End-to-End Modeling Reveals Species-Specific Effects of Large-Scale
   Coastal Restoration on Living Resources Facing Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion and wetland loss are affecting Louisiana to such an
   extent that the loss of land between 1932 and 2016 was close to 5,000
   km(2). To mitigate this decline, coastal protection and restoration
   projects are being planned and implemented by the State of Louisiana,
   United States. The Louisiana Coastal Master Plan (CMP) is an adaptive
   management approach that provides a suite of projects that are predicted
   to build or maintain land and protect coastal communities. Restoring the
   coast with this 50-year large-scale restoration and risk reduction plan
   has the potential to change the biomass and distribution of economically
   and ecologically important fisheries species in this region. However,
   not restoring the coast may have negative impacts on these species due
   to the loss of habitat. This research uses an ecosystem model to
   evaluate the effects of plan implementation versus a future without
   action (FWOA) on the biomass and distribution of fisheries species in
   the estuaries over 50 years of model simulations. By simulating effects
   using a spatially-explicit ecosystem model, not only can the changes in
   biomass in response to plan implementation be evaluated, but also the
   distribution of species in response to the planned restoration and risk
   reduction projects. Simulations are performed under two relative sea
   level rise (SLR) scenarios to understand the effects of climate change
   on project performance and subsequent fisheries species biomass and
   distribution. Simulation output of eight economically important
   fisheries species shows that the plan mostly results in increases in
   species biomass, but that the outcomes are species-specific and
   basin-specific. The SLR scenario highly affects the amount of wetland
   habitat maintained after 50 years (with higher levels of wetland loss
   under increased SLR) and, subsequently, the biomass of species depending
   on that habitat. Species distribution results can be used to identify
   expected changes for specific species on a regional basis. By making
   this type of information available to resource managers, precautionary
   measures of ecosystem management and adaptation can be implemented.},

Abstract = {As a contribution to the 2019 World Water Day, the Accademia Nazionale
   dei Lincei promoted a symposium on ``Coastal protection and
   management{''}. A selection of the papers presented at the meeting have
   been assembled as a Topical Collection. Costal zones are densely
   populated due to their morphological, climate, economic and recreational
   opportunities, but are exposed to the adverse effects of the sea action,
   in the recent decades worsened by growing human impact and sea level
   rise. Both erosion and accretion change the shoreline and the coastal
   zones, with the first prevailing today. Different estimates have been
   produced of beach erosion at a global or national level. In Italy more
   than 40\% of the low coasts are presently eroding, despite decades of
   expensive beach defence works. In addition, high coastal infrastructures
   and settlements recently became more frequently exposed to storm surges.
   The papers collection deals with (a) monitoring studies of natural and
   man-induced shoreline changes, (b) hard and soft shore protections
   projects, (c) littoral hazards as tsunami, extreme high waters and storm
   surges, (d) protection of cultural heritage threatened by sea. General
   considerations on the challenge posed by the sea-level rise and possible
   solutions, i.e. defence, adaptation or managed retreat, are briefly
   summarized.},

Abstract = {Planned climate change adaptation initiatives are being developed with
   both external and endogenous resources at an increasing rate, especially
   in developing countries. As climate change continues to pose risks to
   vulnerable communities, there is a growing need to identify lessons
   learned in the process of planning and implementing climate change
   adaptation strategies. This is even more pressing for communities in
   remote contexts where access to resources and support services is
   limited. This study used thematic analysis to identify key insights from
   a 20-year old community-based resource management and development
   initiative on a remote island in Fiji. Four themes emerged relating to:
   perceptions of environmental change, links between conservation
   initiatives and people's livelihoods, balance between external support
   and community-driven efforts, and the continuity of initiatives. Whilst
   acknowledging that every community in the Pacific has unique capacities
   for dealing with climate change, the four identified themes are
   considered applicable to other subsistence-dominated peripheral
   communities within Fiji, the Pacific Islands region and beyond. This has
   the potential to improve planning processes and ensure both continuity
   and efficacy of efforts towards supporting sustainable livelihoods in
   communities already experiencing the impacts of climate change.},

Abstract = {Populus euphratica Oliv., a pioneer species of desert riparian forest,
   is characterized heterophylly. To understand the adaptation strategies
   of the heteromorphic leaves of P. euphratica to soil drought, we
   assessed the structural and functional characteristics of the
   heteromorphic leaves at different heights in suitable soil moisture
   conditions (groundwater depth 1.5 m) and drought conditions (groundwater
   depth 5 m), which include morphology, anatomical structure,
   photosynthetic capacity, water use efficiency, osmotic adjustment
   capacity, and endogenous hormones. These results indicate that leaf
   area, leaf thickness, fence tissue, palisade-to-sea ratio, main vein
   xylem area, vessel area, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate,
   and proline, MDA, IAA, GA(3), and ZR contents showed a positive
   correlation with the tree height under the two soil moisture conditions,
   but leaf shape index, leaf water potential (LWP), and ABA content showed
   a decreasing trend. In addition, the main vein vascular bundle area,
   main vein xylem area, and contents of malondialdehyde, ABA, GA(3), and
   IAA were significantly greater under soil drought conditions than normal
   soil water content. Under soil drought stress, the heteromorphic leaves
   of P. euphratica showed more investment in anatomical structure and
   greater water use efficiency, proline, and hormone contents, and
   synergistic changes to maintain high photosynthetic efficiency. This is
   an adaptation strategy to water stress caused by soil drought and tree
   height changes.},

   operational strategies},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {High-impact and low-probability (HILP) extreme events can cause severe
   damage to power systems. Microgrids (MGs) with distributed generation
   resources provide a viable solution for the resilience enhancement of
   distribution networks during extreme events. In this paper,
   resilience-oriented modeling details are appropriately presented across
   four dimensions: modeling objectives and metrics, resilience scenarios,
   control methods and resilience-oriented strategies. Three types of
   objective functions are commonly used in existing literature: load
   maximization, cost minimization and frequency stabilization. To mimic
   realistic resilience scenarios, uncertainty information, contingencies,
   distributed generation resources and interdependencies between power
   systems and other networks (e.g. gas networks) are main factors that
   need to be considered. Energy management system, optimal power flow and
   dynamic control are three basic approaches utilized to model resilient
   power systems. As far as operational strategies in relation to network
   topologies are concerned, four types are typically met in the
   literature, these being existing MGs for network resilience, dynamic
   formation of MGs, islanding schemes of MGs and networked MGs. Different
   types of MGs and different control methods are also appropriately
   presented in this part. Finally, research challenges are identified and
   several future research directions are provided.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},

Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Inherent statistics of the surface temperature pattern were used to
   categorize urban heat islands (UHIs) for a tropical mega city and its
   satellite towns. Application of flexible threshold values for UHI zoning
   made this procedure independent of seasonal or locational influences.
   UHI zones for the years 1999, 2009, and 2019 were mapped from Landsat
   thermal bands by applying the mono-window algorithm. The parameters
   affecting the UHI intensity were rigorously investigated. Dynamics of
   land use land cover patterns provided in-depth insight into the
   spatiotemporal variability of UHI. The abrupt rises in localized surface
   temperature for every decade were recognized and thoroughly explained
   with the fall in fractional vegetation cover index and increase in
   normalized difference impervious surface index. The temporal nature of
   urban agglomeration and fragmentation of vegetation cover was quantified
   through landscape metric algorithms. The vegetation pattern and
   associated surface temperature fall were further used to evaluate the
   weakening of UHI intensity around major recreational zones. Substantial
   cooling by 0.938 degrees C was noted on daytime, from urban built-up at
   a 50-m distance to the green parks. Differential rates of urbanization
   and associated magnification of UHIs were looked into separately for
   central urban and satellite town areas. The characteristics of built-up
   density and proximity to green areas were employed to strategize
   mitigatory measures for the constantly growing UHI problem. Urgent needs
   for sustainable policies and green landscaping were highlighted through
   multi-criterion analysis.},

Title = {Coastal management in Portugal: Practices for reflection and learning},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Portugal is located in the southwest of Europe. From economic, cultural,
   social and environmental point of views, Portuguese coastal areas face
   multiple challenges related to the coastal management policy,the
   functionality of the governmental services and the responses to the
   society, in particular, to the affected citizens. Qualitative and
   quantitative understanding of the coastal morphological processes is
   necessary, as it is a precondition for a successful coastal management
   approach. This paper aims to provide a general overview of the recent
   morphological coastal development in Portugal, summarize some past
   experiences on coastal protection and identify potential problems and
   challenges as an attempt to support an integrated coastal management
   policy that can be applied in Portugal and other countries facing the
   same difficulties to mitigate and manage coastal erosion. Special focus
   is given to the legal status and policy on coastal monitoring, by
   analyzing the administration responsibilities concerning coastal
   management, legislation and regulations, as well as policy tools
   schemes, built into the legal structure with different levels of
   hierarchy. The manuscript ends with a brief analysis of some future
   coastal protection measures that are part of a national coastal
   adaptation strategy proposed to fulfill a set of goals to be established
   by 2050.},

Title = {Food for thought: Climate change risk and food (in)security in Tuvalu},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change presents a considerable threat to food security of
   low-lying atoll nations in the Pacific including Tuvalu. It is projected
   to heavily impact agricultural and fishery sectors in Tuvalu,
   threatening food chains and the ability of Tuvaluans to produce and
   access safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary and cultural
   needs. In addition to climate change impacts, food security in Tuvalu is
   affected by a number of interconnected socio-economic, transboundary and
   ecosystem factors including access to land, traditional food-acquiring
   skills, food availability and affordability, cultural practices and the
   changing way of life. In fact, decline in traditional food-acquiring
   skills, the lack of interest in local food production practices, and
   other unfortunate socioeconomic circumstances continue adversely
   affecting food (in)security in Tuvalu. This study assessed the risk of
   climate change from the perspective of food security domain considering
   exposure to flood hazard. The results of risk assessment suggested that
   revival of traditional food-acquiring skills is an important adaptation
   strategy. Strategies at the community and government levels are proposed
   to prevent adverse impacts of flooding on and prevent food security in
   Tuvalu.},

Title = {Flexible Division and Unification Control Strategies for Resilience
   Enhancement in Networked Microgrids},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {474-486},

Abstract = {Networking a series of autonomous microgrids (MGs) is a strategic effort
   toward the resilience enhancement in extreme conditions. In this paper,
   flexible division and unification control strategies are proposed to
   help networked MGs prepare adequately for extreme events and adapt
   comprehensively to subsequent changing conditions, which enhance the
   system resilience. According to the proposed strategies, networked MGs
   can switch between two distinct modes of division and unification by
   utilizing a sparse communication network without requiring any
   additional communication infrastructures or controllers. In division
   mode, each MG is regulated by its local master controllers (MCs) for
   active power sharing, which ensures that disruptions are handled
   effectively by local energy resources without utilizing those in
   adjacent MGs. Thus, any islanding or resynchronization of individual MGs
   would not introduce further disruptions to the remaining networked
   system. The proposed control strategies imply that the networked MGs
   system in division mode is managed in a proactive way to adequately
   prepare the networked system for extreme events. In the unification
   mode, the remaining networked MGs, which are still functional, use the
   proposed algorithm to share all available energy resources and adapt to
   continuously changing operating conditions in order to respond to
   extreme events. The proposed control algorithm for devising a flexible
   networked MGs system is a cost-effective scheme that can fully exploit
   the system operation flexibility corresponding to different operation
   stages for enhancing resilience. The proposed control strategies are
   applied to a networked AC MGs system and the performance is tested using
   time-domain PSCAD/EMTDC simulations.},

Abstract = {The coastal zone of Bangladesh is suffering from a wide range of climate
   change-driven hazards. Limited attention has been given to these zones'
   food security assessment. Therefore, this study aims to assess the
   status of food security and its determinants among different groups of
   Bangladeshi coastal households. It also identifies their livelihood
   risks and coping strategies during stressed situations. Data were
   collected from 1350 households from coastal districts through a
   questionnaire survey. Food security was calculated and compared with the
   recommended average (2400 kcal/capita/day). A binary logit model was
   used to identify the determinants of food security among rural coastal
   households. Livelihood risks and coping mechanisms were recorded through
   open-ended questions. The findings of this study revealed that although
   on average, sampled households were food secure (2753 kcal/capita/day),
   81\% of landless households and 72\% of marginal landholders within the
   sample appeared food insecure. Among various food items, rice supplied
   the greatest total daily calorie intake (1841.47 kcal), second was the
   edible oil (172.27 kcal). The regression model revealed that farm size,
   farm income, off-farm income, and crop production had positive impacts
   on households' food security. Floods, salinity, heavy rainfall, and
   reduction of land productivity were high risks to the large farm
   households, while heavy rainfall, floods, and salinity were high risks
   to the landless farm households. To cope with these risks, the majority
   of large farm households used their savings and sold livestock and
   poultry as coping strategies. The landless and marginal farmers were
   mostly helped by nongovernmental and government-run organizations, moved
   elsewhere to find work, sold their labor, and were involved in fishing.
   It was concluded that different groups of farmers face different
   challenges. Our findings indicate that in order to protect landless and
   marginal farmers, government should implement policies aimed at
   increasing crop production by means of prioritizing saline-tolerant crop
   varieties and the creation of more job opportunities.},

Abstract = {Cities in Asia are at risk from climate change, amplifying current
   hazards and introducing sea-level rise. Various efforts mitigating these
   challenges are framed in the context of building resilience. A challenge
   is that effort is directed at technical solutions, failing to recognize
   governance gaps that slow or prevent `mainstreaming' resilience into
   government functions. Experience from Indonesia's malleable governance
   frameworks demonstrates that resilience-building measures need to be
   addressed as a long-term process based on alignment with government
   priorities and planning cycles. Resilience projects are milestones on
   the road toward effective resilience building. These issues are not
   restricted to Asia and learning on how to address such problems are
   applicable for urban climate change resilience practitioners in Africa
   and beyond.},

Title = {Coastal Vulnerability Assessment of Bali Province, Indonesia Using
   Remote Sensing and GIS Approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal zones are considered to be highly vulnerable to the effects of
   climate change, such as erosion, flooding, and storms, including sea
   level rise (SLR). The effects of rising sea levels endanger several
   nations, including Indonesia, and it potentially affects the coastal
   population and natural environment. Quantification is needed to
   determine the degree of vulnerability experienced by a coast since
   measuring vulnerability is a fundamental phase towards effective risk
   reduction. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to identify
   how vulnerable the coastal zone of Bali Province by develop a Coastal
   Vulnerability Index (CVI) of areas exposed to the sea-level rise on
   regional scales using remote sensing and Geographic Information System
   (GIS) approaches. This study was conducted in Bali Province, Indonesia,
   which has a beach length of similar to 640 km, and six parameters were
   considered in the creation to measure the degree of coastal
   vulnerability by CVI: geomorphology, shoreline change rate, coastal
   elevation, sea-level change rate, tidal range, and significant wave
   height. The different vulnerability parameters were assigned ranks
   ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the lowest and 5 indicating the
   highest vulnerabilities. The study revealed that about 138 km (22\%) of
   the mapped shoreline is classified as being at very high vulnerability
   and 164 km (26\%) of shoreline is at high vulnerability. Of remaining
   shoreline, 168 km (26\%) and 169 km (26\%) are at moderate and low risk
   of coastal vulnerability, respectively. This study outcomes can provide
   an updated vulnerability map and valuable information for the Bali
   Province coast, aimed at increasing awareness among decision-makers and
   related stakeholders for development in mitigation and adaptation
   strategies. Additionally, the result may be utilized as basic data to
   build and implement appropriate coastal zone management.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses some of the most significant risks for the
   preservation of coastal cultural resources or cultural heritage. As a
   result, more research is needed to facilitate the design and
   implementation of feasible and transparent adaptation strategies for
   cultural resources under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we
   begin to explore the challenges and opportunities that face cultural
   resource managers as they begin to grapple with climate change
   adaptation planning in dynamic coastal environments. Specifically, we
   provide an overview of a value-focused, decision-analytic approach that
   was applied in a pilot test of climate adaptation planning for buildings
   within designated historic districts on the barrier islands of Cape
   Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. We provide descriptions of
   the challenges that are uniquely facing cultural resource managers and
   initial evidence of the utility of this type of approach for informing
   judgments by presenting pre- and post-workshop survey data. Although
   additional research is critical to offer planning and policy guidance,
   we found that structured deliberations about cultural resource
   adaptation planning not only influenced participants' opinions but also
   provided a necessary space to better understand the complexities of
   climate and budget uncertainties. Our evaluation is a first step at
   documenting the difficult and value-laden decisions that must be
   addressed by cultural resource managers as fiscal constraints and
   impending climate impacts threaten the traditional approach of
   preservation in perpetuity.},

Title = {Behind the increasing erosion problem: The role of local institutions

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {76-87},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are one of the most impacted and altered regions
   worldwide, both because of natural reasons and because of the large
   population that is concentrated along the coasts. In Argentina, the
   problem of coastal erosion is very important as these areas represent
   the 18.33\% of the whole territory with 36\% of population living in
   this area. The objective of the present article is to characterize the
   main problems related to the use of resources and coastal management,
   leading to coastal erosion, from the perceptions of stakeholders and
   decision makers in the coastal zone of Pehuen Co and Monte Hermoso,
   Argentina. The fieldwork was performed by participative methodologies,
   while the results were analyzed under the institutional and social
   capital theoretical framework. One of the main results of the paper is
   that the lack of a strong social capital in the region and the existence
   of formal monitoring and sanctioning procedures developed by distant
   governmental institutions have increased the overexploitation of coast
   and beaches. Notwithstanding, the current and future relevance of
   coastal erosion for the region will demand the elaboration of bottom-up
   policies to reduce the vulnerability of the region and the performance
   of the adaptation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recently Taiwan's coastal land is highly development and utilization.
   Particularly in the west coastal space carry large bearing capacity. But
   the study assessment of the climate change capacity for coastal zoning
   has less researches in Taiwan. Therefore, this study discussed the
   management competition in laws, regulations and space, proposed the
   suitable designated range and criteria, established the indicators based
   on Chiu {[}1]. On the other hand, the increasing of typhoons frequency
   and sea level rise on the coastal impact are discussed. Combined with
   vulnerability in the coastal areas, through the relevant disaster risk
   analysis and assessment of coastal areas can be described by future
   adaptation strategies to climate change and coastal protection zoning
   basic analysis of the basis set. This study not only defined the range
   for Coastal Protection Areas (CPA), but also based on the suggestion of
   International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) proposed the
   Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) and Coastal Vulnerability Level (CVL)
   fitting Taiwan's coastal environment by 10 factors and the impact of sea
   level rising. Finally, we developed a classification approach and
   designed criteria as a reference for coastal protection zone planning in
   the future.},

Title = {Panarchy suggests why management mitigates rather than restores
   ecosystems from anthropogenic impact},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {327},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Panarchy, a model of dynamic systems change at multiple, interconnected
   spatiotemporal scales, allows assessing whether management influences
   ecological processes and resilience. We assessed whether liming, a
   management action to counteract anthropogenic acidification, influenced
   scale-specific temporal fluctuation frequencies of benthic invertebrates
   and phytoplankton assemblages in lakes. We also tested whether these
   fluctuations correlated with proxies of liming (Ca:Mg ratios) to
   quantify scale-specific management effects. Using an ecosystem
   experiment and monitoring data, time series analyses (1998-2019)
   revealed significant multiscale temporal (and thus panarchy) structure
   for littoral invertebrates across limed and reference lakes. Such
   patterns were inconsistent for sublittoral invertebrates and
   phytoplankton. When significant panarchy structure was found, Ca:Mg
   ratios correlated with only a few of the identified temporal fluctuation
   frequencies across limed and reference lakes. This suggests that liming
   effects become diluted in the managed lakes. The lack of mani-festations
   of liming across the independent temporal fluctuation patterns suggest
   that this lake management form fails to create and enforce cross-scale
   interactions, a crucial component of ecological resilience. This
   interpre-tation supports liming as a mitigation effort rather than a
   tool to restore acidified lakes to a self-organizing system equivalent
   of circumneutral references.},

Title = {A Cost-Benefit Approach to Discuss Artificial Nourishments to Mitigate
   Coastal Erosion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Worldwide, artificial nourishments are being considered as one of the
   main coastal erosion mitigation measures. However, this solution is not
   permanent, since the natural removal of sediments that occurs after the
   sand deposition leads to the need of re-nourishment projects; thus, its
   performance and longevity dependent on several design parameters
   (placement site and extension alongshore, frequency, and volume, etc.)
   In this work, a methodological approach for cost-benefit assessment is
   applied to analyze the performance of artificial nourishments from a
   physical and economical point of view, by analyzing the effectiveness of
   different scenarios. The study was developed considering two study
   areas: a hypothetical situation (generic study area) and a real coastal
   stretch (Barra-Vagueira, located in the Portuguese west coast). The
   findings show the complexity in defining the best nourishment option,
   being dependent on the wave climate, site specific conditions, and main
   goal of the intervention. The proposed cost-benefit approach allows one
   to obtain and compare the physical and economic performance of
   artificial nourishments to mitigate coastal erosion, aiding the
   decision-making processes related to coastal planning and management.},

Title = {Multi-objective optimization of urban environmental system design using
   machine learning},
Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {94},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The efficacy of urban mitigation strategies for heat and carbon
   emissions relies heavily on local urban characteristics. The continuous
   development and improvement of urban land surface models enable rather
   accurate assessment of the environmental impact on urban development
   strategies, whereas physically-based simulations remain computationally
   costly and time consuming, as a consequence of the increasing complexity
   of urban system dynamics. Hence it is imperative to develop fast,
   efficient, and economic operational toolkits for urban planners to
   foster the design, implementation, and evaluation of urban mitigation
   strategies, while retaining the accuracy and robustness of physical
   models. In this study, we adopt a machine learning (ML) algorithm, viz.
   Gaussian Process Regression, to emulate the physics of heat and biogenic
   carbon exchange in the built environment. The ML surrogate is trained
   and validated on the simulation results generated by a state-of-the-art
   single-layer urban canopy model over a wide range of urban
   characteristics, showing high accuracy in capturing heat and carbon
   dynamics. Using the validated surrogate model, we then conduct
   multi-objective optimization using the genetic algorithm to optimize
   urban design scenarios for desirable urban mitigation effects. While the
   use of urban greenery is found effective in mitigating both urban heat
   and carbon emissions, there is manifest trade-offs among ameliorating
   diverse urban environmental indicators.},

Title = {Overview of West African fisheries under climate change: Impacts,
   vulnerabilities and adaptive responses of the artisanal and industrial
   sectors},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {15-28},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change affects ocean conditions, fish stocks and hence
   fisheries. In West Africa, climate change impacts on fisheries were
   projected to be mainly negative through multi-facet ways. However,
   analysis of adaptation responses of fishers to climate change impacts is
   scarce. This paper reviews the impacts on climate change on fisheries in
   West Africa and discusses the potential adaptation strategies adopted by
   both the artisanal and industrial fishing sectors. Overall, climate
   change and over-exploitation have altered species composition of
   fisheries catches in West Africa. The effect of ocean warming on
   fisheries is indicated by the increase in dominance of warmer water
   species in the landings, shown from an increase in Mean Temperature of
   Catch, in the region. Climate change induced changes in potential catch
   and species composition, which inherently have similar symptoms as
   over-exploitation, are expected to have repercussions on the economic
   and social performance of fisheries. Both artisanal and industrial
   sectors may adapt to these changes mainly through expansion of fishing
   ground that increases operation costs. Our results highlight that
   historical changes in target species are more common in industrial than
   artisanal fisheries. This result challenges the prevailing assumption
   that artisanal fisheries, given their limited movement capacity, would
   adapt to climate change by shifting target species and/or gear type. (C)

Abstract = {The study examined the variations of selected climatic variables
   (rainfall and temperature) and the perceptions of small-scale farmers on
   the effects of extreme climate condition on cropping activities in the
   rain forest ecological region in southwest Nigeria. The area is
   characterized by three different subecological strata (the mountainous
   Akoko region in the north, the southern coastal area, and the middle,
   relatively lowland and more urbanized area) whose effects on the climate
   are made explicit in the relatively different values of the climate
   variables. Analysis of the responses to questions on perceptions of
   extreme climate effects indicated that about 70\% of the farmers were
   aware of the effects of extreme climate events on crop production and
   yield, and over 50\% indicated that too early rainfall, late rainfall,
   prolonged dryness after an initial rainfall, excessive rainfall, and
   windstorms were the common weather-related causes of low crop yields.
   More than 76\% of the farmers changed planting dates and diversified
   their crops as mitigation measures, while about 72\% adopted mulching
   and intercropping as adaptation strategies against extreme weather
   conditions. Only less than 20\% had access to government support
   facilities and modern infrastructure. The study concluded that although
   the farmers respond to variable and extreme climate events in the study
   area, the responses, being not adequately supported by adequate farming
   infrastructure, do not guarantee sustainable food security in the
   region.},

Abstract = {The global overexploitation of fish stocks is endangering many marine
   food webs. Scientists and managers now call for an ecosystem-based
   fisheries management, able to take into account the complexity of marine
   ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services they provide. By
   contrast, many fishery management plans only focus on maximizing the
   productivity of harvested stocks. Such practices are suggested to affect
   other ecosystem services, altering the integrity and resilience of
   natural communities. Here we show that while yield-maximizing policies
   can allow for coexistence and resilience in predator-prey communities,
   they are not optimal in a multi-objective context. We find that although
   total prey and predator maximum yields are higher with a prey-oriented
   harvest, focusing on the predator improves species coexistence. Also,
   moderate harvesting of the predator can enhance resilience. Furthermore,
   increasing maximum yields by changing catchabilities improves resilience
   in predator-oriented systems, but reduces it in prey-oriented systems.
   In a multi-objective context, optimal harvesting strategies involve a
   general tradeoff between yield and resilience. Resilience-maximizing
   strategies are however compatible with quite high yields, and should
   often be favored. Our results further suggest that balancing harvest
   between trophic levels is often best at maintaining simultaneously
   species coexistence, resilience and yield.},

Title = {A critical review of cyanobacteria distribution and cyanotoxins
   occurrence in Atlantic Ocean islands},
Journal = {CRYPTOGAMIE ALGOLOGIE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {9},
Pages = {73-89},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria are diverse, complex and a unique group of microorganisms
   that inhabit a wide variety of environments. Contrarily to continental
   areas, studies on cyanobacteria in islands are scarce and need to be
   reinforced, since climate change impacts are expected to be harsher in
   islands, due to their geographical isolation and higher exposition to
   external influences. Here we present a review of the occurrence of
   cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in inland and coastal ecosystems in the
   Atlantic Ocean islands. These microorganisms were reported from diverse
   habitats, including saline thermal lakes Iceland), freshwater lakes,
   terrestrial habitats (Azores, Cuba), and marine coastal areas, either
   planktonic (Madeira, Canary Islands, Cape Verde) or associated to plants
   and corals (Brazil, Caribbean Sea). Most of cyanobacteria were reported
   from freshwaters but some species were found in different habitats.
   Species richness also varied between islands, with higher number in
   islands located in temperate regions, and the number of common taxa was
   low (1-3\%). Several toxic species and different types of cyanotoxins

Title = {Spatial management measures for disease mitigation as practiced in
   Scottish aquaculture},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {93-100},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aquaculture is an increasingly important economic activity in coastal
   waters. The fluid environment means spatial management is an important
   tool for protecting fish health. Scottish aquaculture (largely Atlantic
   salmon) uses a range of different types of area to group farms for
   different management or reporting purposes related to fish health. Farm
   Management Areas are defined by local knowledge and used by industry for
   co-operation among groups of farms, including in the management of sea
   lice. Disease Management Areas, defined using a simple but robust model,
   are used by the Scottish Government for control of notifiable diseases.
   Particle dispersal models are used to assess areas affected by treatment
   residue around farms, and to manage maximum allowable area biomass for
   environmental protection. Sophisticated models of sea lice transport
   have been developed to help Inform management of this key parasite.
   Large regional areas are used for a variety of purposes, such as a
   policy presumption against new farms covering the entire east and north
   coasts of Scotland, and five reporting areas for official production
   statistics. Scottish aquatic environments are shared by many interest
   groups and spatial management is proving essential for sustainable
   development by aquaculture and other users. Crown Copyright (C) 2016

Title = {Synergistic Interactions between Urban Heat Islands and Heat Waves: The
   Impact in Cities Is Larger than the Sum of Its Parts{*}},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2051-2064},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cities are well known to be hotter than the rural areas that surround
   them; this phenomenon is called the urban heat island. Heat waves are
   excessively hot periods during which the air temperatures of both urban
   and rural areas increase significantly. However, whether urban and rural
   temperatures respond in the same way to heat waves remains a critical
   unanswered question. In this study, a combination of observational and
   modeling analyses indicates synergies between urban heat islands and
   heat waves. That is, not only do heat waves increase the ambient
   temperatures, but they also intensify the difference between urban and
   rural temperatures. As a result, the added heat stress in cities will be
   even higher than the sum of the background urban heat island effect and
   the heat wave effect. Results presented here also attribute this added
   impact of heat waves on urban areas to the lack of surface moisture in
   urban areas and the low wind speed associated with heat waves. Given
   that heat waves are projected to become more frequent and that urban
   populations are substantially increasing, these findings underline the
   serious heat-related health risks facing urban residents in the
   twenty-first century. Adaptation and mitigation strategies will require
   joint efforts to reinvent the city, allowing for more green spaces and
   lesser disruption of the natural water cycle.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Urbanized delta areas worldwide share a growing tendency of exposure to
   water stress induced by the effects of climate change and anthropogenic
   factors, threatening the operation of infrastructure systems and future
   urban development. The important synergistic impacts coexisting with
   freshwater scarcity are increasing urbanization rates, subsiding soils,
   saltwater intrusion in aquifers and rivers, coastal erosion, and
   increased flooding. Innovative design strategies and concepts for the
   integration of decentralized rainwater management measures can
   contribute to the integrated and climate resilient planning of urban
   spaces that are threatened by climate change scenarios that worsen the
   security of urban infrastructures and the future availability of fresh
   water. Decentralized rainwater management, including retention, storage,
   and reuse strategies that are integrated into spatial planning and urban
   design, can reduce flood risks while simultaneously enhancing freshwater
   availability. This paper discusses a paradigm shift in urban water
   management, from centralized to decentralized management (that is, from
   threats to opportunities), using the example of two case studies.
   Concepts and strategies for building climate resilient cities, which
   address flood control, the protection of freshwater resources, and the
   harmonization of a natural and more sustainable water balance, are
   presented for Almere (Rhine Schelde Delta, The Netherlands) and Hsingchu
   (Dotzpu Delta, Taiwan).},

Title = {The resilience of coastal ecosystems: A functional trait-based
   perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems provide important services to human population, such
   as nurseries for fish, carbon storage and coastal protection. However,
   the pressure faced by these systems due to global changes will strongly
   challenge the capacity of coastal ecosystems to persist. Therefore, it
   is crucial to understand the resilience of coastal ecosystems.
   Here, I propose that combining a resilience framework based on ecosystem
   properties with the functional trait response-effect framework would
   allow researchers and managers to quantify the resilience of coastal
   ecosystems. I place emphasis on salt marsh and sand dunes because of the
   higher availability of studies for these systems.
   First, I introduce the resilience framework based on ecosystem
   properties and, second, I show how adopting a functional trait
   perspective in this framework would allow researchers to link how
   environmental changes influence ecosystem properties. In turn, measuring
   the changes in ecosystem properties would allow researchers to measure
   the resilience of the system.
   Synthesis. I reviewed several types of disturbances (e.g. storms and
   sea-level rise) that are threatening the persistence of coastal
   ecosystems, with an emphasis on salt marshes and sand dunes. Applying
   this resilience framework reveals, for instance, that the same suite of
   traits (e.g. plant density and stiffness) increase marsh resistance to
   multiple threats (e.g. storms and sea-level rise); yet, these traits
   vary along environmental gradients (e.g. along estuaries) and,
   therefore, marshes resilience vary accordingly. Overall, this framework
   would allow researchers to gather crucial insights on the resilience of
   coastal ecosystems and to set reference marks for measuring their
   resilience under environmental changes.},

Title = {A Spatial DEA-Based Framework for Analyzing the Effectiveness of
   Disaster Risk Reduction Policy Implementation: A Case Study of
   Earthquake-Oriented Urban Renewal Policy in Yongkang, Taiwan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to the many large earthquakes that have occurred in recent years,
   the role of seismic risk reduction in building resilient cities has
   become a matter of concern. The serious disaster damage brought by
   seismic hazards causes the adoption of migration policies such as
   building control in the preparedness phase. However, the restricted
   budget of governments resulting from the global state of economic
   distress generates a prioritization problem. A decision support
   framework could be helpful for governments to systematically integrate
   the complex information when implementing disaster risk reduction
   policies toward sustainable development. The purpose of this study was
   to construct an analytical framework based on Geographic Information
   System (GIS) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for addressing the
   prioritization problem by calculating policy efficiency. The spatial
   DEA-based framework combines indices calculation, spatial database
   construction, and DEA. Taiwan is an island located in the Circum-Pacific
   Belt, and has paid long-term attention to adopting policies for
   earthquake disaster prevention. A policy of earthquake-oriented urban
   renewal combining enhanced building capacity and city resilience has
   recently been implemented. A case study of the Yongkang district of the
   Tainan Metropolis in Taiwan was conducted in this study. The results
   show an operable framework and propose a suggestion for planning
   efficient policy priorities in each decision-making unit. In sum, the
   analytical framework proposed in this study could be a component of a
   decision support system for governments to adopt disaster risk reduction
   policies in the process of policy-making and implementation.},

Title = {Predicted impact of the sea-level rise at Vellar-Coleroon estuarine
   region of Tamil Nadu coast in India: Mainstreaming adaptation as a
   coastal zone management option},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {327-339},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Low-lying coastal areas are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change as they are highly prone for inundation to SLR (Sea-Level Rise).
   This study presents an appraisal of the impacts of SLR on the coastal
   natural resources and its dependent social communities in the low-lying
   area of Vellar-Coleroon estuarine region of the Tamil Nadu coast, India.
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from SRTM 90M (Shuttle Radar
   Topographic Mission) data, along with GIS (Geographic Information
   System) techniques are used to identify an area of inundation in the
   study site. The vulnerability of coastal areas in Vellar-Coleroon
   estuarine region of Tamil Nadu coast to inundation was calculated based
   on the projected SLR scenarios of 0.5 m and 1 m. The results
   demonstrated that about 1570 ha of the LULC (land use and Land cover) of
   the study area would be permanently inundated to 0.5 m and 2407 ha for 1
   m SLR and has also resulted in the loss of three major coastal natural
   resources like coastal agriculture, mangroves and aquaculture. It has
   been identified that six hamlets of the social communities who depend on
   these resources are at high-risk and vulnerable to 0.5 m SLR and 12
   hamlets for 1 m SLR. From the study, it has been emphasized that
   mainstreaming adaptation options to SLR should be embedded within a
   coastal zone management and planning effort, which includes all coastal
   natural resources (ecosystem-based adaptation), and its dependent social
   communities (community-based adaptation) involved through capacity
   building. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {135-151},
Abstract = {Storage of CO2 as hydrates in sub-seabed sediments has been indicated as
   an alternative solution for the geological storage of CO2, suitable for
   offshore areas where large ocean depths and low temperatures exist at
   short distance from the shore. This paper presents the works conducted
   to identify the CO2 hydrates stability zone, i.e., the areas where CO2
   hydrates may form and remain stable, in the deep offshore of Portugal.
   The methodology involved building maps of geothermal gradient, seabed
   temperature, detailed bathymetry and conversion to hydrostatic pressure,
   and maps of sediment thickness. These data were integrated in a GIS
   environment and a Fortran code was implemented to compute the thickness
   of the hydrate stability zone, based on the pressure and the temperature
   conditions in the sub-seabed sediments. Preferential areas, where
   further studies should be conducted, are delineated.},

Title = {Comprehensive coastal vulnerability assessment and adaptation for
   Cherating-Pekan coast, Pahang, Malaysia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {182},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is having a profound impact on most coastal regions
   around the world. Sea Level Rise (SLR) has exposed the coastal regions
   to various threats, such as inundation and erosion, which consequently
   influence the coastal environments. The main objective of this study is
   to assess the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) of the Pahang coast.
   This CVI comprises six variables, i.e. coastal geomorphology, coastal
   slope, rate of erosion and accretion, mean significant wave height, mean
   tidal range and rate of sea level rise. The vulnerability levels for 18
   management units along the Cherating-Pekan coast are classified into
   five vulnerability rankings: very low, low, moderate, high and very
   high, based on the rating values of the above mentioned parameters. The
   findings indicated that two areas, namely Tjg Payang - Sg Balok and
   Cheruk Paloh - Kuala Pahang were categorized as high vulnerability level
   with 97.22\% and 91.67\% respectively. Meanwhile, 5.56\% and 22.22\% of
   the 87 km Cherating-Pekan coastline has low and very low vulnerability.
   Furthermore, the CVI values of 33.33\% and 27.78\% represent the high
   and moderate vulnerability category, respectively. Finally, the outcome
   of this study provides a comprehensive framework which can be used by
   researchers, decision makers and relevant authorities to formulate and
   implement mitigation and adaptation measures in an effort to address the
   impacts of climate change on coastal regions.},

Title = {Challenges to climate change adaptation in coastal small towns: Examples
   from Ghana, Uruguay, Finland, Denmark, and Alaska},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The ability of a coastal settlement to adapt to climate change is
   largely dependent upon access to a range of resources, which many
   coastal towns and small cities lack. Coastal small towns of less than
   10,000 are therefore at a significant disadvantage compared to larger
   settlements when it comes to adaptation. One way to begin to overcome
   this disadvantage is to compare coastal small towns in order to identify
   efficiencies and support knowledge sharing. In this article we present
   and analyse five case studies of coastal small towns: Fuvemeh, Ghana;
   Kiyu, Uruguay; Hanko, Finland; Lemvig, Denmark; and Nome, Alaska, USA. A
   number of key outcomes and lessons were identified which highlights the
   need for a formal network of international coastal small towns to
   encourage and develop knowledge sharing practices going forward. A
   further lesson is the importance of using a range of indicators in order
   to establish the regional/national importance of a town. Basing this
   solely on population size can result in an erroneous interpretation of
   the significance (and therefore adaptive capacity) of a coastal small
   town. Finally, despite many barriers to adaptation in coastal small
   towns, being small offers some potential advantages, such as the
   possibility of being able to form a community consensus more easily,
   using 3D visualisations for adaptation planning, and having managed
   realignment as a realistic management option. It is imperative that
   climate change resilience in coastal small towns is increased by
   focussing on overcoming barriers and developing appropriate adaptation
   approaches by governments, non-governmental organisations, business, and
   researchers.},

Title = {Socio-hydrology: A key approach for adaptation to water scarcity and
   achieving human well-being in large riverine islands},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rapid global changes (population growth, urbanization and frequent
   extreme weather conditions) have cumulatively affected local water
   bodies and resulted in unfavorable hydrological, ecological, and
   environmental changes in the major river systems. Particularly,
   communities in isolated riverine islands are heavily affected due to
   their poor adaptive capacities, which is well documented in the
   contemporary literature. The focal point for the vulnerability of these
   people lies in the water resources (drinking water availability,
   agricultural water quality, salt-water intrusion, flooding etc.) and the
   future interaction between human and water systems. This paper advocates
   the importance of socio-hydrological research in the context of
   enhancing social adaptive capacity as well as for developing a resilient
   water environment in three very large riverine islands in Asia:
   Fraserganj (India), Dakshin Bedkashi (Bangladesh) (both from the
   Ganges-Brahaputra-Meghna Delta) and Con Dao Island (Mekong River,
   Vietnam). It also explores how the nexus of human-water relations could
   be applied to improve adaptive measures to manage local water needs
   while mitigating undesirable changes to the hydrological cycle.
   Socio-hydrological models as an integrated tool can be used to quantify
   the feedbacks between water resources and society at multiple scales,
   with the aim of expediting stakeholder participation for sustainable
   water resource management. The proposed idea in this study will be
   helpful to sketch projections of alternatives that explicitly account
   for plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological
   system, which will yield both insights into cause-effect relationships
   and help stakeholders to identify safe functioning space.},

   eco-evolutionary modelling perspective},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {426},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Coral reef systems are under increasing pressure to adapt to rapidly
   varying environmental conditions, in particular increasing ocean
   temperatures. A question of major concern is whether coral reefs can
   adapt to and survive the predicted increases in global temperatures over
   the remainder of this century.
   A simple model of a coral reef ecosystem is developed to include
   adaptation of key growth and mortality parameters for a coral polyp
   population and its symbiotic algae population. Interacting populations
   of pelagic phytoplankton and zooplankton are also simulated.
   The model simulates a stable coral reef ecosystem in the absence of
   climate change, but predicts the extinction of the coral population
   under global warming if the populations do not adapt. However, when the
   coral and symbiont populations adapt to climate change, a stable coral
   reef ecosystem is predicted. The model allows identification of
   processes and parameters to inform attempts to measure the key
   attributes of adapting coral reef ecosystems.},

Title = {Projections of the climate potential for tourism at local scales:
   application to Platja de Palma, Spain},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {14},
Pages = {2095-2107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Primary socioeconomic activities in the System of Platja de Palma
   (SPdP), located in the southwestern coast of Mallorca, Spain, are
   beach-based holidays and, therefore, are very closely linked to climate.
   The social, economic and environmental adaptation that this region must
   make in the mid- and long-term period has to take into account the
   changes in the tourist potential when the climate changes. A
   second-generation climate index for tourism (CIT) has been adopted to
   measure tourism potential under the present and possible future climatic
   conditions. CIT is a theoretically based and empirically derived index
   that allows assessing the sun, sea and sand (3S) weather resource. Daily
   observed series of 2 m maximum temperature, precipitation, 2 m relative
   humidity, cloud cover and 10 m wind speed have been used to derive the
   present climate potential for tourism. For future projections, daily
   averaged meteorological variables have been obtained from a set of
   regional climate models (RCMs) within the European ENSEMBLES project.
   The adoption of a multimodel ensemble strategy allows quantifying the
   uncertainties arising from model errors and boundary conditions. To use
   CIT values based on RCM data properly at local scales, a
   quantilequantile adjustment has been applied. Results show a significant
   increase in the annual frequency of days with acceptable conditions
   together with a slightly increment for the ideal climate perceptions at
   the expense of decreasing unacceptable categories. For the summery peak
   season, ideal conditions are projected to decrease from mid-century
   favouring acceptable categories. However, an almost general increase for
   both classes is anticipated in spring and autumn throughout the century.
   That is, higher frequencies of optimal climate perceptions for carrying
   out 3S outdoors activities are expected to shift from the peak to
   shoulder seasons. Therefore, climate change would result in a major
   impact for the current seasonally adjusted service sector in SPdP. With
   this information at hand, policy makers and the team of experts planning
   its socioeconomic future can respond more effectively to the demanding
   challenge of local adaptation to climate change by implementing
   adaptation and mitigation strategies to the tourist sector. Copyright

Title = {Landscape and field characteristics affecting winter waterfowl grazing
   damage to agricultural perennial forage crops on the lower Fraser River
   delta, BC, Canada},
Journal = {CROP PROTECTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {51-58},

Abstract = {The lower Fraser River delta is an important waterfowl staging area on
   the lower coast of British Columbia, Canada. Since the early 1980s,
   wintering waterfowl have been causing economically significant damage to
   perennial forage fields (hay, pasture and silage). We examined the
   effect of farm management practices and landscape attributes on the
   extent of grazing damage on a total of 196 perennial forage fields
   between 2001 and 2005. Multiple regression analysis and an
   information-theoretic model comparison approach were used to identify
   field and landscape parameters that account for variation in damage.
   Rather than limit our evaluation to single-species use of forage crops,
   we considered the combined grazing impact of a complex of wintering
   waterfowl, including lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens), American
   wigeon (Anas americana), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), northern pintail
   (Anus acuta), and trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator) and identified
   which management practices might mitigate overall grazing damage. Forage
   species composition and availability of alternative feeding areas had an
   effect on waterfowl grazing damage to perennial forage fields. Fields
   with higher proportions of orchard grass showed higher levels of grazing
   damage; and damage was lower in years when abundant alternative feeding
   areas (AFAs) in the form of unharvested potatoes were available.
   Although these factors were found to be important in explaining
   variation in damage to perennial forage fields, our best model accounted
   for only 13\% of the variation in damage. Mitigation efforts must be
   comprehensive and consider a wide range of factors that influence damage
   to perennial forage fields. Although manipulation of field
   characteristics and management of AFAs can contribute to waterfowl
   grazing damage mitigation, strategic geographic distribution of AFAs and
   management of human disturbance in designated AFA areas would further
   mitigate damage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Combining hazard, exposure and social vulnerability to provide lessons
   for flood risk management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {42-52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Flood risk assessments provide inputs for the evaluation of flood risk
   management (FRM) strategies. Traditionally, such risk assessments
   provide estimates of loss of life and economic damage. However, the
   effect of policy measures aimed at reducing risk also depends on the
   capacity of households to adapt and respond to floods, which in turn
   largely depends on their social vulnerability. This study shows how a
   joint assessment of hazard, exposure and social vulnerability provides
   valuable information for the evaluation of FRM strategies. The adopted
   Methodology uses data on hazard and exposure combined with a social
   vulnerability index. The relevance of this state-of-the-art approach
   taken is exemplified in a case-study of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The
   results show that not only a substantial share of the population can be
   defined as socially vulnerable, but also that the population is very
   heterogeneous, which is often ignored in traditional flood risk
   management studies. It is concluded that FRM measures, such as
   individual mitigation, evacuation or flood insurance coverage should not
   be applied homogenously across large areas, but instead should be
   tailored to local characteristics based on the socioeconomic
   characteristits of individual households and neighborhoods. (C) 2014

Title = {Adaptation knowledge for New Zealand's primary industries: Known, not
   known and needed},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Abstract = {Climate sensitive primary industries including pastoral farming,
   high-value horticulture and viticulture are central to Aotearoa-New
   Zealand's economy. While advances have been made in understanding the
   impacts and implications of climate change critical knowledge gaps
   remain, particularly for adaptation. This study develops and applies a
   novel methodology to identify and characterise adaptation knowledge for
   primary industries. The basis for the review is ten years' of research
   and action under the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change
   (SLMACC) program, supplemented with a systematic review of the published
   literature. Reports (n=32) and literature (n=22) are reviewed and
   assessed using the Adaptation Knowledge Cycle to characterise analytical
   and empirical foci. The detailed assessment of knowledge for Impacts,
   Implications, Decisions or Actions enables a robust and rigorous
   assessment of existing knowledge, identifies critical research gaps and
   emerging needs. Results show research to date has focused almost
   exclusively on understanding the impact of climate variability and
   extremes on land management. There are significant empirical (e.g.
   location and sector) and methodological (e.g. integrated assessments,
   scenarios, and vulnerability assessment) gaps, for at risk regions and
   sectors, and limited understanding of the decisions and actions
   necessary to enable successful adaptation. To inform future adaptation
   planning, additional work is required to better understand the
   implications, decision-making processes and obstacles to action. More
   detailed understanding of location-, season-, time- and sector-specific
   responses to climate change is also necessary. Findings advance our
   understanding of adaptation knowledge and reflect on diversity of
   information necessary to enable and sustain resilient rural futures and
   provide a conceptual and methodological basis for similar assessments
   elsewhere.},

Title = {Wide Green Dikes: A sustainable adaptation option with benefits for both
   nature and landscape values},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {528-538},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The dual task of reinforcing the dikes along the Dutch coast and
   preparing for the effects of climate change have stimulated a search for
   innovative dike designs. Triggered by the presence of gently sloped
   grass covered dikes that merge smoothly into the adjacent salt marshes
   along the German Wadden Sea coast, we assessed the potential costs and
   benefits of just such a `Wide Green Dike' along the Dutch Wadden Sea
   coast, compared to the `Traditional Dike', which is now used. The
   Traditional Dike has a steeper seaward slope and a stone or asphalt
   revetment along the dike toe. The assessment criteria were identified by
   local experts. We investigated, particularly, the spatial impact of a
   Wide Green Dike on the adjacent salt marshes under various climate
   scenarios. We also looked at the initial costs and clay demand for both
   dike designs. Furthermore, we conducted a quick-scan of the vegetation
   present halfway up the seaward slope of a Traditional Dike in the
   Netherlands and a Wide Green Dike nearby in Germany. Our analysis
   revealed four primary advantages of use of a Wide Green Dike along the
   Dutch part of the Dollard estuary: lower initial costs (based on
   standard unit prices), greater ease of doing repairs, increased
   adaptability and enhanced spatial quality compared to a Traditional
   Dike. Both types of dike were designed to withstand an extreme storm
   surge with an occurrence probability of 1/4000 years. Both fully met
   legally mandated engineering standards as well. Though the required
   crest height is comparable for both designs, the Wide Green Dike had a
   larger areal footprint, and would overlap more Natura 2000 area than a
   Traditional Dike. There would thus be a trade-off concerning salt-marsh
   area. Moreover, the vegetation examined halfway up the seaward slope of
   the German Wide Green Dike offered little ecological value. Nonetheless,
   cyclic harvesting of sediment for periodic dike reinforcement appeared
   to be a sustainable option for adapting to future sea level rise. (C)

Title = {Vulnerability assessment of coastal fishing communities for building
   resilience and adaptation: Evidences from Tamil Nadu, India},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {114-130},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The coastal communities are the most vulnerable to climate vagaries,
   which affect their habitat and livelihood alike. Vulnerability
   assessments undertaken using quantitative or qualitative methods at
   macro- or micro-level need to capture the location and context so as to
   be able to use them towards improving mitigation and resilience
   strategies at the community level, where the impact is felt. The
   characteristics of the marine fishing villages differ from those of
   other villages in any coastal block / district in a State, making a
   strong case for a marine village-specific vulnerability assessment as
   well as intervention planning. This work, capturing this grassroots
   reality and deriving vulnerability indicators that affect fisheries and
   coastal households, pilots a novel socioeconomic vulnerability (SEVIPH)
   and cumulative vulnerability (CVIPH) framework in marine fishing
   villages of Thoothukudi, a coastal district of Tamil Nadu in India, and
   compares it with an existing framework (SEVISV) that relies on secondary
   data. A set of 54 indicators reflecting vulnerability components such as
   exposure, sensitivity (fishery and social) and adaptive capacity
   (economic, development drivers and alternate livelihood activity) has
   been developed. Primary data were collected from 1741 households
   residing in all the 24 marine fishing villages in Thoothukudi district
   to estimate various sub-indices and indices of SEVIPH, SEVISV and CVIPH.
   Significant differences (p < 0.01) in sensitivity index (SI) and
   adaptive capacity index (ACI) were observed among the fishing villages,
   which however, got masked at taluk and district level due to
   aggregation, underscoring the importance of household based village
   level assessment of vulnerability. Overall, 42 \% of the fishing
   villages were socio-economically highly vulnerable, while about 71 \% of
   the villages had high cumulative vulnerability index. While the overall
   social and economic status of fishing households were lower compared to
   non-fishing population, it could be ascertained that there was
   relatively less inequity among them. The study also found significant
   disparities and differences (p < 0.05) across the villages/taluks in
   terms of exposure, sensitivity as well as socio-economic capabilities to
   respond, adapt and develop resilience. The two dimensional decision
   matrix plotted against SI and ACI median threshold values presented a
   greater contrast and helped in identifying the key drivers (or
   contributing factors) and buffers (or ameliorating factors) for coastal
   vulnerability of marine fishing villages to aid in location-specific
   intervention planning. The study also highlighted the need for imparting
   need-based location-specific training programmes at the village and
   taluk level for vulnerability reduction.},

Abstract = {Climate-change problems in coastal zones are predominantly perceived
   from a water perspective. However, in accordance with the temporal and
   spatial scales at which the effects of climate change occur, we propose
   that coastal zones have to be regarded as sedimentary systems, rather
   than mere delimitations of a water system. Long-term coastal evolution
   is ultimately governed by the balance between demand and supplies of
   sediment so a sediment perspective on climate change and adaptation is
   an essential addition to the traditional water perspective. The coastal
   policy of the Netherlands is presented as an application of this
   perspective. We show that flood-risk in the coastal zone is, in essence,
   caused by sediment deficiency. The coast is managed accordingly, with
   coastal nourishments. We tentatively extend sediment-based adaptation
   options to the entire coastal plain, with examples such as a sustained
   land-raising effort or ultra-wide ('infallible') dikes. Based on
   preliminary estimates of sediment requirements and costs, such options
   seem feasible (technically and financially at least), and should be
   further explored},

Abstract = {South American forests contain a large fraction of the world's
   biodiversity, but it is obvious that if current trends of deforestation
   continue unchanged over the next decades, native forests will decline to
   an unacceptable levels. A landscape perspective to sustainable forest
   management and conservation provides a holistic framework to build up
   future research and tools towards an adaptive forest management approach
   to preserve forest biodiversity value while promoting the sustainable
   use of these forests. In this chapter we stress the importance of a
   landscape ecology perspective towards managing forests. We focus mainly
   on the temperate forests of Argentina and Chile, but within a broader
   framework of other forests in the South American region. An overview of
   threats to native forests is presented, and then new perspectives of
   conservation and management alternatives are analyzed. Our aim is to
   provide specific examples where a landscape ecology holistic approach
   contributes to integrating biodiversity value with the need for forestry
   activities, and provide insights into forest conservation and management
   initiatives, comparing traditional and timber-oriented management with
   new emerging approaches, including contributions of a landscape ecology
   perspective.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {255},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Identification of flood-risk dynamics is pivotal for refurbishing the
   existing and future flood-management options. The present study
   quantifies the marginal and compound contributions of hazard and
   vulnerability to flood-risk through an innovative concept of
   Risk-classifier, designed in the form of a 5 x 5 choropleth. The
   proposed framework is demonstrated at the finest administrative scale of
   village-level over Jagatsinghpur district in Mahanadi River basin,
   Odisha (India) for two-time frames: Scenario-I (1970-2011) and
   Scenario-II (1970-2001). An increase in high and very high hazard and
   vulnerable villages is noticed in Scenario-I, the majority of them lying
   in the coastal stretches (S-E region) and adjoining flood plains of
   Mahanadi River (N-W region). Scenario-I is characterized by the majority
   of hazard-driven and compound (both hazard and vulnerability) risk
   villages, while Scenario II is characterized by a majority of
   vulnerability driven-risk villages. For the vulnerability-driven risk
   villages, rigorous enforcement of policies and mitigation schemes are
   recommended, while for hazard-driven risk villages, enhancement of
   structural measures and flood-plain zoning should be exercised. Such
   exhaustive flood-risk information may serve as a valuable cartographic
   product for the civic authorities and stakeholders and help in
   prioritizing flood mitigation actions for improved environmental
   planning and management.},

Title = {Influence of non-stationarity and auto-correlation of climatic records

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID LAND},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Trend and stationarity analysis of climatic variables are essential for
   understanding climate variability and provide useful information about
   the vulnerability and future changes, especially in arid and semi-arid
   regions. In this study, various climatic zones of Iran were investigated
   to assess the relationship between the trend and the stationarity of the
   climatic variables. The Mann-Kendall test was considered to identify the
   trend, while the trend free pre-whitening approach was applied for
   eliminating serial correlation from the time-series. Meanwhile, time
   series stationarity was tested by Dickey-Fuller and
   Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin tests. The results indicated an
   increasing trend for mean air temperature series at most of the stations
   over various climatic zones, however, after eliminating the serial
   correlation factor, this increasing trend changes to an insignificant
   decreasing trend at a 95\% confidence level. The seasonal mean air
   temperature trend suggested a significant increase in the majority of
   the stations. The mean air temperature increased more in northwest
   towards central parts of Iran that mostly located in arid and semiarid
   climatic zones. Precipitation trend reveals an insignificant downward
   trend in most of the series over various climatic zones; furthermore,
   most of the stations follow a decreasing trend for seasonal
   precipitation. Furthermore, spatial patterns of trend and seasonality of
   precipitation and mean air temperature showed that the northwest parts
   of Iran and margin areas of the Caspian Sea are more vulnerable to the
   changing climate with respect to the precipitation shortfalls and
   warming. Stationarity analysis indicated that the stationarity of
   climatic series influences on their trend; so that, the series which
   have significant trends are not static. The findings of this
   investigation can help planners and policy-makers in various fields
   related to climatic issues, implementing better management and planning
   strategies to adapt to climate change and variability over Iran.},

Abstract = {This research synthesises two evaluations of a local level climate
   change adaptation and planning process in the southernmost coastal
   region, Kanyakumari, India which was supported through community-based
   appraisals. First, understanding the public perception of climate change
   factors is crucial in generating support for climate change response.
   Second, generating enough grass-root level support from the local
   population to assess the long-term climate change impacts on
   decision-making to design the adaptation strategies for sea-level rise.
   These two results highlight the level of understanding and awareness of
   climate change's impact by the local population in the coastal region of
   Kanyakumari. A well-designed questionnaire with structured interviews,
   to collect data on local knowledge and local perception of climate
   change and sea-level rise from 100 respondents was distributed each in
   44 coastal villages in the study area. The finding showed that 20.7\% of
   the local population have knowledge of climate change and its impacts
   and 18.4\% of the population agreed that the impact of sealevel rise is
   experienced in the coastal region. This study is to provide insight into
   the communities' knowledge of the adaptive capacity of the local
   population to cope with climate change towards the treaty of sea-level

Abstract = {Gnathotrichus materiarius (Fitch, 1858) is an alien ambrosia beetle from
   North America, that has been spreading across Europe since the 1930s.
   The species infests coniferous trees, excavating galleries in sapwood.
   However, to date very few studies have predicted changes in ambrosia
   beetle habitat suitability under changing climate conditions. To fill
   that gap in the current knowledge, we used the MaxEnt algorithm to
   estimate areas potentially suitable for this species in Europe, both
   under current climate conditions and those forecasted for the years 2050
   and 2070. Our analyses showed areas where the species has not been
   reported, though the climatic conditions are suitable. Models for the
   forecasted conditions predicted an increase in suitable habitats. Due to
   the wide range of host trees, the species is likely to spread through
   the Balkans, the Black Sea and Caucasus region, Baltic countries, the
   Scandinavian Peninsula, and Ukraine. As a technical pest of coniferous
   sapwood, it can cause financial losses due to deterioration in quality
   of timber harvested in such regions. Our results will be helpful for the
   development of a climate-change-integrated management strategy to
   mitigate potential adverse effects.},

   fishery resource in North America. Using a model that links ocean
   temperature, predator density, and fishing to population productivity,
   we show that harvester-driven conservation efforts to protect large
   lobsters prepared the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery to capitalize on
   favorable ecosystem conditions, resulting in the record-breaking
   landings recently observed in the region. In contrast, in the warmer
   southern New England region, the absence of similar conservation efforts
   precipitated warming-induced recruitment failure that led to the
   collapse of the fishery. Population projections under expected warming
   suggest that the American lobster fishery is vulnerable to future
   temperature increases, but continued efforts to preserve the stock's
   reproductive potential can dampen the negative impacts of warming. This
   study demonstrates that, even though global climate change is severely
   impacting marine ecosystems, widely adopted, proactive conservation
   measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Global climate change, especially the phenomena of global warming, is
   expected to increase the intensity of land-falling hurricanes. Societal
   adaptation is needed to reduce vulnerability from increasingly intense
   hurricanes. This study quantifies the adaptation effects of potentially
   policy driven caps on housing densities and agricultural cover in
   coastal (and adjacent inland) areas vulnerable to hurricane damages in
   the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal regions of the U. S. Time series
   regressions, especially Prais-Winston and Autoregressive Moving Average
   (ARMA) models, are estimated to forecast the economic impacts of
   hurricanes of varying intensity, given that various patterns of land use
   emerge in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal states of the U. S. The
   Prais-Winston and ARMA models use observed time series data from 1900 to
   2005 for inflation adjusted hurricane damages and socio-economic and
   land-use data in the coastal or inland regions where hurricanes caused
   those damages. The results from this study provide evidence that
   increases in housing density and agricultural cover cause significant
   rise in the de-trended inflation-adjusted damages. Further, higher
   intensity and frequency of land-falling hurricanes also significantly
   increase the economic damages. The evidence from this study implies that
   a medium to long term land use adaptation in the form of capping housing
   density and agricultural cover in the coastal (and adjacent inland)
   states can significantly reduce economic damages from intense
   hurricanes. Future studies must compare the benefits of such land use
   adaptation policies against the costs of development controls implied in
   housing density caps and agricultural land cover reductions.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the vulnerability to climatic and socioeconomic
   stresses in the Reef Islands, Solomon Islands, an atoll island group in
   the Southwest Pacific. Climate change and the associated sea-level rise
   are often seen as the most pressing challenges to atoll communities, yet
   this study aims at critically re-assessing this view by placing climate
   in the context of a range of other internal and external stressors
   affecting local livelihoods, including population growth, inadequate
   land use practices, and lack of economic potential, as well as external
   factors such as poorly developed infrastructure, economic
   marginalization and weak governance of Solomon Islands. Findings suggest
   that some of these non-climatic stresses are currently - and in the
   short term - more important determinants of local vulnerability than
   climate change and sea-level rise. Certainly, these stresses are likely
   to be exacerbated by different elements of climate change in the short,
   medium and long term, but generally speaking climate change does not
   appear to be a major driver of the current changes in the islands. On
   the basis of these observations, the possible adaptation options,
   relevant to different time scales, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Pelagic longline fishing has been identified as a significant threat to
   endangered sea turtle populations. Reducing sea turtle bycatch in
   pelagic longline fisheries, in concert with activities to reduce other
   anthropogenic mortality sources, may halt and reverse population
   declines. Here, we examine the effect of bait manipulation as a simple
   mitigation method that could reduce sea turtle interactions with
   longline fishing gear. We analyzed laboratory experiments and field
   trials conducted in the Mediterranean, the northeast Distant Area in the
   Atlantic and the Western North Pacific. Studies showed that turtles are
   more likely to feed on squid than on mackerel when both are used
   simultaneously as bait. The stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca, used as bait,
   was more effective than mackerel; this ray was vulnerable and stimulated
   much thought about other species to use as alternative bait. Effective
   in laboratory conditions with captive turtles, dyed and artificial bait
   did not seemed to be effective in reducing turtle bycatch in field
   conditions. Optimal mitigation measure must reduce incidence of hooking
   of threatened sea turtles to acceptable levels and also offer an
   economic advantage to fisheries. Studies concerning the effect of bait
   modification to reduce turtle bycatch highlight the importance of an
   integrated approach towards sensory deterrents, as both visual and
   chemical cues are likely to attract sea turtles to longline gear.
   Further research on the development of sensory-based deterrents can
   contribute to reduced sea turtle bait interactions and maintain catch
   rates of target species.},

Title = {Using a novel climate-water conflict vulnerability index to capture
   double exposures in Lake Chad},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {351-366},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate variability is amongst an array of threats facing agricultural
   livelihoods, with its effects unevenly distributed. With resource
   conflict being increasingly recognised as one significant outcome of
   climate variability and change, understanding the underlying drivers
   that shape differential vulnerabilities in areas that are double-exposed
   to climate and conflict has great significance. Climate change
   vulnerability frameworks are rarely applied in water conflict research.
   This article presents a composite climate-water conflict vulnerability
   index based on a double exposure framework developed from advances in
   vulnerability and livelihood assessments. We apply the index to assess
   how the determinants of vulnerability can be useful in understanding
   climate variability and water conflict interactions and to establish how
   knowledge of the climate-conflict linked context can shape interventions
   to reduce vulnerability. We surveyed 240 resource users (farmers,
   fishermen and pastoralists) in seven villages on the south-eastern
   shores of Lake Chad in the Republic of Chad to collect data on a range
   of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity variables. Results
   suggest that pastoralists are more vulnerable in terms of
   climate-structured aggressive behaviour within a lake-based livelihoods
   context where all resource user groups show similar levels of exposure
   to climate variability. Our approach can be used to understand the human
   and environmental security components of vulnerability to climate change
   and to explore ways in which conflict-structured climate adaptation and
   climate-sensitive conflict management strategies can be integrated to
   reduce the vulnerability of populations in high-risk, conflict-prone
   environments.},

Title = {Climate adaptation strategies: achieving insight in microclimate effects
   of redevelopment options},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {110-136},
Abstract = {Purpose - Due to the predicted global temperature rise and local
   expansion and densification of cities, Urban Heat Islands (UHI) are
   likely to increase in the Netherlands. As spatial characteristics of a
   city influence its climate, urban design could be deployed to mitigate
   the combined effects of climate change and UHIs. Although cities are
   already experiencing problems during warm-weather periods, no clear
   spatial means or strategies are available for urban designers to
   alleviate heat stress. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - There is a lack of knowledge on cooling
   effects that can be achieved through urban design in Dutch
   neighbourhoods. In this paper, the cooling effects of various design
   measures are compared on the level of urban blocks and neighbourhoods,
   with a focus on a 1960s neighbourhood in Amsterdam-West. The cooling
   effects are simulated by means of the microclimate model ENVI-met, here
   the effects on air temperature and physiological equivalent temperature
   will be evaluated.
   Findings - The use of green, and a higher roof albedo in particular,
   seem to perform well as cooling measures. Combinations of cooling
   measures do not necessarily result in better performance and might even
   counteract other cooling effects. However, combinations of measures that
   lead to an increase in the environmental temperature show the largest
   heating.
   Research limitations/implications - Effects of green roofs and facades
   are beyond the scope of this study, though future suggestions for this
   research will be included.
   Originality/value - The results add to the body of knowledge in the area
   of climate design enabling policy makers and designers to estimate the
   effect of simulated measures in comparable neighbourhoods and thus
   improve thermal comfort in outdoor spaces.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH},

Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global warming has caused changes in air temperatures, ocean heat
   content, and sea levels, and these changes might strengthen tropical
   cyclones (TCs) around the Korean Peninsula and exacerbate the damage
   that these storms can have on both coastal and inland communities.
   Therefore, there is an urgent need in this region to update hazard
   mitigation plans for TCs and improve community resilience measures to
   cope with the corresponding damage. In accordance with such efforts,
   this study aims to build quantitative statistical datasets about
   typhoons in the northwestern Pacific Ocean that approach the Korean
   Peninsula and use these data to analyze the characteristics of typhoon
   activity (e.g., TC genesis location, TC path, recurving position, and
   intensity) and the accompanying spatio-temporal changes in rainfall.
   During 1966 to 2009, significant changes in the timing, paths, and
   frequencies of strong summer typhoons were observed along with increases
   in the intensity of summer typhoon rainfall over portions of the Han
   River basin and the Nakdong River basin. We hope that these findings
   will provide foundational information for disaster prevention efforts
   and assist natural resource managers to protect river basins and secure
   water resources. (C) 2015 International Association for

Title = {Spatiotemporal Variation of Urban Heat Islands for Implementing
   Nature-Based Solutions: A Case Study of Kurunegala, Sri Lanka},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},

Abstract = {Changes in the urban landscape resulting from rapid urbanisation and
   climate change have the potential to increase land surface temperature
   (LST) and the incidence of the urban heat island (UHI). An increase in
   urban heat directly affects urban livelihoods and systems. This study
   investigated the spatiotemporal variation of the UHI in the Kurunegala
   urban area (KUA) of North-Western Province, Sri Lanka. The KUA is one of
   the most intensively developing economic and administrative capitals in
   Sri Lanka with an urban system that is facing climate vulnerabilities
   and challenges of extreme heat conditions. We examined the UHI formation
   for the period 1996-2019 and its impact on the urban-systems by
   exploring nature-based solutions (NBS). This study used annual median
   temperatures based on Landsat data from 1996 to 2019 using the Google
   Earth Engine (GEE). Various geospatial approaches, including spectral
   index-based land use/cover mapping (1996, 2009 and 2019), urban-rural
   gradient zones, UHI profile, statistics and grid-based analysis, were
   used to analyse the data. The results revealed that the mean LST
   increased by 5.5 degrees C between 1996 and 2019 mainly associated with
   the expansion pattern of impervious surfaces. The mean LST had a
   positive correlation with impervious surfaces and a negative correlation
   with the green spaces in all the three time-points. Impacts due to
   climate change, including positive temperature and negative rainfall
   anomalies, contributed to the increase in LST. The study recommends
   interactively applying NBS to addressing the UHI impacts with effective
   mitigation and adaptation measures for urban sustainability.},

Journal = {MECHANICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Solution and diffusion process of carbon dioxide (CO2) in seawater is
   important in the research and development of CO2 ocean sequestration
   technology to mitigate global warming. In this study, solution and
   diffusion process of single CO2 bubble in seawater and pure water were
   experimentally studied under various pressures and temperatures to
   evaluate the transport process of CO2 in seawater. The solution process
   was conducted in a test vessel. CO2 bubble was generated by a CO2 bubble
   generator installed at the bottom of the vessel. The diameter of CO2
   bubble was recorded using a high speed video camera. The pressure and
   temperature of liquids were measured by using a pressure transducer and
   thermocouples. Experimental conditions for the temperature ranged from
   277 K to 297 K, and the pressure ranged from around 101 kPa up to 400
   kPa. It was obtained that the complete solution time decreases with the
   increase in pressure due to its higher solubility at a higher pressure.
   It decreases with an increase in temperature arising from a higher
   diffusivity at a high temperature. It was clarified that the complete
   solution time for CO2 in seawater is longer than that in pure water due
   to its relatively lower solubility compared with pure water.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tropical coral reefs harbour a reservoir of enormous biodiversity that
   is increasingly threatened by direct human activities and indirect
   global climate shifts. Emerging coral diseases are one serious threat
   implicated in extensive reef deterioration through disruption of the
   integrity of the coral holobiont - a complex symbiosis between the coral
   animal, endobiotic alga and an array of microorganisms. In this article,
   we review our current understanding of the role of microorganisms in
   coral health and disease, and highlight the pressing interdisciplinary
   research priorities required to elucidate the mechanisms of disease. We
   advocate an approach that applies knowledge gained from experiences in
   human and veterinary medicine, integrated into multidisciplinary studies
   that investigate the interactions between host, agent and environment of
   a given coral disease. These approaches include robust and precise
   disease diagnosis, standardised ecological methods and application of
   rapidly developing DNA, RNA and protein technologies, alongside
   established histological, microbial ecology and ecological expertise.
   Such approaches will allow a better understanding of the causes of coral
   mortality and coral reef declines and help assess potential management
   options to mitigate their effects in the longer term.},

Title = {Beyond coastal protection: A robust approach to enhance environmental
   and social outcomes of coastal adaptation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {217},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Hard coastal protective infrastructure, such as breakwaters, are a
   common adaptation strategy to protect assets, increase safety and
   improve navigation by reducing erosion and flood risks along coastlines
   globally. However, protective structures can have pervasive impacts on
   use patterns, aesthetics and associated ecosystems, threatening
   ecosystem goods and services upon which humans depend. Guided by a
   recent Australian state Government strategy that aims to plan for ``a
   healthy coast and sea managed for the greatest wellbeing of the
   community, now and into the future{''}, we present a decision-making
   support tool for practitioners to help achieve more sustainable
   solutions to coastal adaptation into the future. Sustainable coastal
   adaptation needs to consider the environmental and socio-economic
   consequences of hard protective infrastructure, as well as the increased
   vulnerability due to rising sea levels. To demonstrate our arguments, we
   introduce three different coastal scenarios. We also discuss
   alternatives to coastal protection and make scenario-specific
   recommendations to enhance environmental and socio-economic outcomes of
   coastal adaptation. In general, the implementation of hard protective
   infrastructure should probably be a last resort after retreat and soft
   approaches have been ruled out as viable options. Where protective
   infrastructure is the current best option, environmental and
   socioeconomic outcomes can be enhanced using eco-engineering and
   multi-use features. In the long term, however, retreat from some coastal
   areas may be necessary and existing infrastructure might be removed or
   abandoned.},

Abstract = {Population biology of the intertidal crabs Pachygrapsus marmoratus
   Fabricius, 1787 and P. maurus (Lucas 1846) was investigated at cobble
   beaches with different levels of wave exposure. Surveys were taken
   monthly over 1.5 years at three intertidal levels. The growth rate of
   both species was similar, although P. marmoratus reached larger sizes.
   This species was more abundant on the mid-littoral zone of sheltered
   beaches, whereas P. maurus was more abundant on more exposed ones. The
   sex ratio was male biased in both species, particularly for the smaller
   and larger size classes. Both species showed an extended reproductive
   season, coinciding with the rising temperatures of spring and summer,
   with ovigerous females being found from June to September for P.
   marmoratus and from May to August for P. maurus. The present study
   indicates that both could develop adaptive strategies allowing them to
   coexist in the Azores littoral. The greater size of P. marmoratus seems
   to be an advantage on the competition for refuges with P. maurus, which
   results in its higher abundance and general dominance in the higher
   shore levels and in less exposed shores. However, P. maurus seems to be
   more fitted to live in the higher hydrodynamic habitats.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {580},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In a context of increasing landscape modifications and climatic changes,
   scale hierarchy becomes an ever more crucial issue to integrate in the
   analysis of drivers and stressors of biological communities, especially
   in river networks. To cope with this issue, we developed (i) spatial
   hierarchical models of functional diversity of stream invertebrate
   communities to assess the relative influence of local-vs. regional-scale
   factors in structuring community assembly, and (ii) analysis of
   metacommunity elements to determine the ecological processes behind the
   structuring. The spatial structuring of benthic invertebrate
   cominunities was investigated over 568 sites in South-eastern France.
   Community structure was mainly driven by the altitudinal gradient and
   spring flow variation at broad scales, with functional diversity
   gradually decreasing with elevation and being maximized at intermediate
   levels of flow variability. According to the `elements of metacommunity
   structure' analysis, the prevailing influence of the altitudinal
   gradient was also supported by a Clenientsian structuration of
   invertebrate communities. Conversely, the influence of observed climatic
   changes in temperature and rainfall was weak and observed only at fine
   scales. As a result, natural environmental filters were stronger drivers
   of the functional diversity of communities than human-induced stressors
   (e.g. water pollution and hydromorphological alterations). More broadly,
   our results suggest that management needs to embrace the possibilities
   of gathering high spatial and taxonomical resolution data when analysing
   and predicting flow variation and climate change effects in order to
   preserve and restore functionally diverse communities. Moreover, to
   develop environmental flow schemes or restoration and climate change
   adaptation strategies for freshwater communities, local and regional
   processes need to be addressed simultaneously; equally responsible as
   drivers of community diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to design an efficient active
   suspension control system for the full car model. The conventional
   passive suspension and semi-active suspension systems do not provide
   good vehicle's handling against the road disturbances and ride comfort.
   To tackle this problem, Wavelets based Recurrent Adaptive NeuroFuzzy
   (WRANF) control approach is used for active suspension control. The
   WRANF control is flexible, has robustness abilities and good
   generalization properties against the dynamic systems. The performance
   of the active suspension system is determined by the displacement and
   acceleration of heave, pitch, roll and seat of the vehicle. To validate
   the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, the full car model is
   simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and subjected to a varying road profile.
   The performance of the WRANF based active suspension system is compared
   with passive and semi-active suspension system.},

Abstract = {Disaster management practitioners are accustomed to dealing with
   changing climates, but rapid anthropogenic climate change is an
   unprecedented problem. Hazards (e.g. storms, coastal flooding, sea level
   rise, heat waves) combine with vulnerabilities (e.g. socioeconomic
   disparity, rapid urbanization, improper land use, rigid governance
   structures) to increase disaster risk in some coastal cities. Focus on
   climate change adaptation (CCA) has been increasing as part of the
   answer to this problem. However, CCA has regularly developed separately
   from relatively established disaster management efforts, and this paper
   argues that CCA should generally be included as part of disaster
   management efforts, utilizing extant social structures, funding streams,
   theories, and more to avoid duplication of effort. Building on this
   conceptual foundation, the paper presents a framework for guiding and
   assessing efforts to reduce this risk. The framework was based on
   theory, then modified during a case study of NewYork City. This allowed
   refinement based on real-world planning, resulting in a theoretically
   grounded framework with a strong focus on application. Key points from
   the investigation are summarized here, interesting themes are discussed,
   and notes on applying the framework are presented.},

Abstract = {Climate change is altering ecological systems throughout the world.
   Managing these systems in a way that ignores climate-change will likely
   fail to meet management objectives. The uncertainty in projected climate
   change impacts is one of the greatest challenges facing managers
   attempting to address global change. In order to select successful
   management strategies, managers need to understand the uncertainty
   inherent in projected climate impacts and how these uncertainties affect
   the outcomes of management activities. Perhaps the most important tool
   for managing ecological systems in the face of climate change is active
   adaptive management, in which systems are closely monitored and
   management strategies are altered to address expected and ongoing
   changes. Here, we discuss the uncertainty inherent in different types of
   data on potential climate impacts and explore climate projections and
   potential management responses at three sites in North America. The
   Central Valley of California, the headwaters of the Klamath River in
   Oregon, and the barrier islands and sounds of North Carolina each face a
   different set of challenges with respect to climate change. Using these
   three sites, we provide specific examples of how managers are already
   beginning to address the threat of climate change in the face of varying
   levels of uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Beijing has experienced a rapid urbanization in the last few decades and
   has been suffering from serious air pollution during recent years. The
   Weather Research and Forecasting-Chem model is used to quantify the
   effects of urbanization on regional climate and air quality and those of
   urban heat island (UHI) mitigation strategy on urban air quality in
   Beijing, with a special focus on the impacts under different weather
   conditions (heat waves in summer and polluted days in winter). The
   modification of rural land use into urban impervious surface
   significantly increases 2-m temperature (T-2) and planetary boundary
   layer height but decreases 2-m relative humidity (RH2) and 10-m wind
   speed (WS10) in urban Beijing, which further leads to the increases in
   surface-layer O-3 concentrations of 9.5ppbv in summer and 1.8ppbv in
   winter and the decreases in PM2.5 concentrations of 16.6gm(-3) in summer
   and 26.2gm(-3) in winter. Compared with normal days (clean days), the
   UHI intensity is enhanced by 11.1\% during heat waves in summer (by
   16.7\% during polluted days in winter). Although increasing urban albedo
   is an effective mitigation strategy to decrease UHI intensity, it
   worsens the urban air quality. When the urban albedo increases from 0.2
   to 0.85, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations are increased by 10.2
   (6.1)gm(-3) in summer (in winter), and the daily maximum O-3
   concentrations are increased by 12.8ppbv under heat waves in summer.},

Title = {The economic impact of sea level rise-induced decrease in the carrying
   capacity of Catalan beaches (NW Mediterranean, Spain)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {218},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR)-induced erosion will contribute significantly to
   the reduction of the surface of beaches worldwide. In the absence of
   adaptation measures, this implies a decrease in the recreational
   carrying capacity provided by beaches, which in turn could significantly
   affect the economies of the areas associated with the ``sun
   and-beach{''} tourism model. Here, we propose a methodology to assess
   the demand-side economic impact by applying an input/output analysis,
   assuming that the beach carrying capacity is linked to the potential
   tourism demand, and consequently, to tourism consumption and output.
   Moreover, to properly evaluate the spatial variations in the impact
   throughout the territory, the effects are downscaled to the county level
   using a set of location coefficients. The model is applied to Catalonia,
   one of the most visited coastal regions in the Mediterranean. Here
   tourism contributes approximately 11\% of its gross domestic product
   (GDP) and most visitors are related to coastal tourism. Although SLR
   affects the entire region with relatively small spatial variations in
   the induced shoreline retreat, its impact on the beach carrying capacity
   per county and the number of potential users exhibits a large spatial
   variability. Considering the RCP8.5 scenario as a reference, Catalonia's
   key coastal tourism brands, Costa Brava and Costa Daurada, will be the
   most affected economically, with an expected GDP loss of approximately
   2200 million euro and 1820 million euro (at 2019 values), respectively.
   Finally, these local estimations were used to identify where the
   greatest benefits/returns would be derived from implementing adaptation
   measures to the SLR. This analysis was done by normalising the GDP
   losses that could be avoided in each county, with the length of beaches
   needed to provide recreation services to sustain the tourism economy.},

Abstract = {In many coastal communities, the risks driven by storm surges are
   motivating substantial investments in flood risk management. The design
   of adaptive risk management strategies, however, hinges on the ability
   to detect future changes in storm surge statistics. Previous studies
   have used observations to identify changes in past storm surge
   statistics. Here, we focus on the simple and decision-relevant question:
   How fast can we learn from past and potential future storm surge
   observations about changes in future statistics? Using Observing System
   Simulation Experiments, we quantify the time required to detect changes
   in the probability of extreme storm surge events. We estimate low
   probabilities of detection when substantial but gradual changes to the
   100-year storm surge occur. As a result, policy makers may underestimate
   considerable increases in storm surge risk over the typically long
   lifespans of major infrastructure projects.},

Abstract = {In this study, the impacts of climate change on the extreme
   precipitation indices in the Western Black Sea Basin, Turkey, were
   investigated in terms of trend analyses based on the historical and
   projected daily precipitation data. Eight extreme precipitation indices
   were computed using the reference period data obtained from nine
   meteorological stations and dynamically downscaled outputs of
   GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-MR global circulation models (GCMs)
   under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The biases in the outputs of
   GCMs were corrected by using the linear scaling method. The Mann-Kendall
   and Spearman's rho tests were utilized to detection of the trend in the
   precipitation indices during the reference (1971-2000) and future
   periods (2020-2099). The results of the analyses for the reference
   period showed a strong increasing trend in indices in the eastern part
   of the basin and nonsignificant trends (both increasing and decreasing)
   in the western part. On the other hand, for the future period, the
   results demonstrated that the amount of total precipitation will
   increase (a positive trend in PRCPTOT). However, the number of dry days
   will increase. This situation indicates that there will be no
   significant change in the total amount of precipitation, but there will
   be an increase in the intensity of precipitation and the number of dry
   days during the coming years that can cause flooding and drought,
   respectively. Therefore, suitable adaptive and mitigative actions have
   to be taken, especially in terms of urban planning and agriculture.},

Abstract = {In Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation, the effects of climate change
   pose new challenges for low-lying coastal communities. This study
   explores how one village on Emau, an island offshore of capital island
   Efate, has developed several overlapping strategies to manage climate
   change impacts, including drought and sea level rise. Informants reveal
   their perceptions of changing environmental baselines and how
   socio-economic processes, including population growth, cultural loss,
   and limited access to cash incomes, have shaped the community's
   response. Informants describe four climate adaptation strategies: 1)
   expanding access to cash income through seasonal or urban labor
   migration; 2) leveraging international expertise and funding to meet
   their goals; 3) developing hybrid forms of traditional practices and
   contemporary ideology to preserve environmental knowledge; and 4)
   performing physical and emotional labor to preserve and remain on their
   land. These strategies span oceans and cross international borders,
   refuting narratives of islands' being `isolated' from the rest of the
   world and passive `victims' of climate change. Contextualizing
   perceptions of and responses to environmental change provides critical
   nuance to the resilience/vulnerability framework, which alone obscures
   ongoing political, social and economic processes on islands.},

Title = {A communication framework for climatic risk and enhanced green growth in
   the eastern coast of Ghana},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {326-336},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Progresses made in global responses to climate change shows that
   adaptation is gradually finding its way into development planning, yet
   delays are generally expected from competing priorities of several
   sectors, policy and knowledge challenges. To understand these dynamics,
   a pathway for enhanced climatic risk communication, which is a form of a
   non-structural adaptation, was analyzed in Ghana's coastal zones. Two
   learning platforms, the Community-based Risk Screening Tool for
   Adaptation and Livelihoods (CRiSTAL), and U-Learning (Theory
   U-Process)were used to engage the state level policy-maldng process in
   governing development within coastal zones in the face of increased
   climatic risks and climate change impacts. Local livelihood priorities
   showed that a national level development planning framework that
   excluded local contexts of climatic risks face possible maladaptation.
   Subsequently the process that was engaged in the local contextualization
   of climatic risks and development in selected Districts culminated in
   the consensus framework, Coastal Zone Green Growth (CZGG), informed
   mostly by concerns over clean energy usage and ecologically compatible
   use of coastal resources. Therefore the CZGG potentially provides
   co-benefits for enhanced ecosystem services, livelihoods and adaptation.
   Thus, it constitutes a denominator for measuring climatic risks and
   adaptation to potentially inform the policy-making process towards
   sustainable coastal zone management practices. Except for the desired
   goals of CZGG being far reaching and futuristic, they overlapped with
   goals of the adaptation strategies of the local population, which are
   similar to development goals. Therefore communicating localized contexts
   of coastal climatic risks of which sea level rise is seen often as
   remote to planning, could strengthen risk management in integrated
   coastal zone management (ICZM) and enhance resilience of vulnerable
   communities. However, this will require the designation of a body which
   is accustomed to the local issues to facilitate, harmonize and
   coordinate multi-sector actions and diverse stakeholders' interests for
   the CZGG to become a reality in contributing to ICZM in Ghana. (C) 2017

   such impacts. But determining whether the observed changes represent
   evolutionary response or phenotypic plasticity remains a challenge. In
   addition, the problem is not recognized in most management plans for
   fish and marine invertebrates that still mandate a minimum size
   restriction. We use examples from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats
   to illustrate some of the biological consequences of size-selective
   harvesting and discuss possible future directions of research as well as
   changes in management policy needed to mitigate its negative biological

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In the continually climate change scenario, it is of great concern to
   revisit, rethink, and improve the existing computational aspects of
   drought indexes. In general, the commonly used drought indexes do not
   encompass environmental changes. Hence, the primary objective of this
   study was to incorporate large-scale climatic oscillations in developing
   the nonstationary Standardized Precipitation Index (SPIN) and
   Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDIN). The nonstationary modeling of the
   drought index is performed using the generalized additive model for
   location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) over 103 grid points covering
   Maharashtra state in India. The computed nonstationary drought indexes
   are then used to examine the spatiotemporal variability of drought over
   the province. The outcomes from the analysis indicate that nonstationary
   modeling outperforms a stationary approach over the study area for
   different drought scales. In addition, notable differences are observed
   while comparing the different drought properties using stationary and
   nonstationary drought indexes. A comparative analysis of the historical
   drought that occurred in 2013 reveals that nonstationarity in the
   meteorological data sets cannot be ignored for developing a sustainable
   mitigation and adaptation strategy against drought hazard. The proposed
   nonstationarity-based drought indexes for Maharashtra can be a feasible
   alternative of drought assessment in a changing climate scenario. (C)

Abstract = {Human mobility in the context of disasters and climate change (HMDCC) is
   a complex problem, which is planetary in scope and intergenerational in
   its impact. From the mid-seventeenth century's little ice age to the
   rising sea levels due to climate change, people have been driven to move
   by environmental factors for a long time. Yet, an international treaty
   regime that addresses the protection needs of persons mobile due to
   environmental factors has never been created. Against this backdrop, the
   Global Compacts were negotiated to reflect a ``sophisticated{''}
   understanding of HMDCC, and their adoption enables cooperation on a wide
   range of policies and laws to this effect. Examining the implementation
   of the Global Compacts with respect to the commitments relating to
   HMDCC, this article finds that States and non-State actors have
   cooperated to address data gaps and to incorporate mobility
   considerations into national frameworks on climate change and disaster
   management. However, States must implement all dimensions of their
   commitments relating to HMDCC, especially with regards to the
   facilitation of migration as an adaptation strategy to disasters and
   climate change, in order to build a comprehensive approach.},

   environmental sciences, and construction building technology were the
   three most frequent subject categories. Building and Environment,
   International Journal of Climatology, and Theoretical and Applied
   Climatology were the three most popular publishing journals. The USA and
   China were the two leading countries in UHI research, contributing
   49.56\% of the total articles. Chinese Academy of Science, Arizona State
   University, and China Meteorological Administration published the most
   UHI articles. Weng QH and Santamouris M were the two most prolific
   authors. Author keywords were classified into four major groups: (1)
   research methods and indicators, e.g., remote sensing, field
   measurement, and models; (2) generation factors, e.g., impervious urban
   surfaces, urban geometry, waste heat, vegetation, and pollutants; (3)
   environmental effects, e.g., urban climate, heat wave, ecology, and
   pollution; and (4) mitigation and adaption strategies, e.g., roof
   technology cooling, reflective cooling, vegetation cooling, and urban
   geometry cooling. A comparative analysis of popular issues revealed that
   UHI determination (intensity, heat source, supporting techniques)
   remains the central topic, whereas UHI impacts and mitigation strategies
   are becoming the popular issues that will receive increasing scientific
   attention in the future. Modeling will continue to be the leading
   research method, and remote sensing will be used more widely.
   Additionally, a combination of remote sensing and field measurements
   with models is expected.},

Abstract = {Densely populated areas along the coast face many problems, including
   erosion, increasing flood risk and habitat deterioration. As economies
   develop, the asset base at risk increases. Simultaneously, the effects
   of climate change result in more extreme events, thus more damage and
   habitat decline. Existing management and defence approaches are not well
   tuned to these challenges, as most assume static situations.
   In the THESEUS1 project (2009-2013), 31 partners are working together in
   an interdisciplinary way to develop instruments for creating low-risk
   coasts for human use and healthy habitats (INFRAM, 2011).
   For this, eight study sites were identified across Europe in the most
   vulnerable coastal environments such as deltas, estuaries and wetlands.
   Many large cities and industrial areas are located in these areas.
   The authors have assessed the coastal systems of these sites from the
   perspective of the risk assessment due from every Member State by 2011.
   A questionnaire was developed and interviews were input for a systems
   analysis, for which the coastal systems were divided into subsystems
   according to risk function (chance x consequences), physical elements
   (sea, foreshore, flood defence, protected area) and land use. Based on
   these analyses, a first impression of possible policy changes,
   organisational and/or mitigation measures was identified. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Tropical cyclones are a common and devastating natural disaster in many
   coastal areas of the world. As the intensity and frequency of cyclones
   will increase under the most likely future climate change scenarios,
   appropriate approaches at local scales (1-5 km) are essential for
   producing sufficiently detailed hazard models. These models are used to
   develop mitigation plans and strategies for reducing the impacts of
   cyclones. This study developed and tested a hazard modelling approach
   for cyclone impacts in Sarankhola upazila, a 151 km(2) local government
   area in coastal Bangladesh. The study integrated remote sensing, spatial
   analysis and field data to model cyclone generated hazards under a
   climate change scenario at local scales covering < 1000 km(2). A storm
   surge model integrating historical cyclone data and Digital Elevation
   Model (DEM) was used to generate the cyclone hazard maps for different
   cyclone return periods. Frequency analysis was carried out using
   historical cyclone data (1960-2015) to calculate the storm surge heights
   of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 year return periods of cyclones. Local sea
   level rise scenario of 0.34 m for the year 2050 was simulated with 20
   and 50 years return periods. Our results showed that cyclone affected
   areas increased with the increase of return periods. Around 63\% of
   study area was located in the moderate to very high hazard zones for 50
   year return period, while it was 70\% for 100 year return period. The
   climate change scenarios increased the cyclone impact area by 6-10 \% in
   every return period. Our findings indicate this approach has potential
   to model the cyclone hazards for developing mitigation plans and
   strategies to reduce the future impacts of cyclones.},

Abstract = {Living Labs are an innovative concept that combines research,
   governance, and citizens, using technology and knowledge. Using design
   thinking techniques as a method of approach, this innovative idea builds
   a bridge between decision makers and stakeholders, promoting a shared
   vision of growth and innovation at the community level. The coastal zone
   is an extremely dynamic area in terms of human and natural activities.
   This is a particularly sensitive area to climate change, necessitating
   ongoing adaptation and mitigating action. This paper aims to introduce
   the application of the Living lab concept in the management of the
   coastal area of Constanta (Romania). The concept of the Living Lab means
   involving citizens along with public bodies and research structures.
   This new coastal management model will use the design thinking approach
   and will consider the pressures that exist between the activities that
   occur in the examined coastal zone. In the study, ``Multi-Criteria
   Analysis of the Mass Tourism Management Model Related to the Impact on
   the Local Community in Constan \& x21b;a (Romania){''}, published in
   MDPI Inventions on 28 June 2021, a coastal management model was built
   that took into consideration only the data given by the government. In
   this paper, the authors aim to expand their research by including data
   from independent sources, using the concept of a Living Lab.},

Abstract = {Tree size-density dynamics can inform key trends in forest productivity
   along with opportunities to increase ecosystem resiliency. Here, we
   employ a novel approach to estimate the relative density (RD, range 0-1)
   of any given forest based on its current size-density relationship
   compared to a hypothetical maximum using the coterminous US national
   forest inventory between 1999 and 2020. The analysis suggests a static
   forest land area in the US with less tree abundance but greatly
   increased timber volume and tree biomass. Coupled with these resource
   trends, an increase in RD was identified with 90\% of US forest land now
   reaching a biologically-relevant threshold of canopy closure and/or
   self-thinning induced mortality (RD > 0.3), particularly in areas prone
   to future drought conditions (e.g., West Coast). Notably, the area of
   high RD stands (RD > 0.6) has quintupled over the past 20 years while
   the least stocked stands (RD < 0.3) have decreased 3\%. The evidence
   from the coterminous US forest RD distribution suggest opportunities to
   increase live tree stocking in understocked stands, while using density
   management to address tree mortality and resilience to disturbances in
   increasingly dense forests.},

Abstract = {Power systems are not designed to survive a large number of simultaneous
   contingencies and are thus vulnerable to extreme events that can cause
   considerable societal and economical losses. Power systems resilience
   against adverse weather events could be enhanced with the implementation
   of Intentional Controlled Islanding (ICI). This paper presents a
   strategy design of ICI to improve system survivability in case of severe
   windstorms. It includes the design of a predetermined network split
   applied with a preventive and an adaptive approach, and a
   decision-making process based on the forecast wind speed. The network
   response to storms is studied dynamically, in order to model cascading
   failures and protection scheme effects. Simulations are conducted on the
   IEEE 39-bus system, then the resilience enhancement is assessed with a
   stochastic approach. ICI is demonstrated to be effective, as the results
   show an significant decrease of blackout risk while limiting unnecessary
   load shedding.},

Title = {Urban-scale air temperature estimation: development of an empirical
   model based on mobile transects},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The urban microclimate is influenced by many factors which trigger the
   well-known Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Different approaches have
   been developed in the literature for estimating urban temperatures, but
   a compromise is always needed, either spatial or temporal. To solve this
   issue, this work presents a new way for estimating urban temperatures
   with a fine spatial resolution (even specific streets) while also
   keeping a high temporal resolution (hourly time-steps) for prolonged
   periods. This is done by developing an empirical model, based on the
   measurements of a reference weather station and data taken from mobile
   transects.
   The proposed method was tested in Seville (Spain). The validation was
   done comparing the prediction of the model with the measurements of a
   fixed temperature sensor, from the 7th of June 2019 until the 7th of
   December 2019 (4390 hours). The results showed a high R-2 coefficient of
   0.976 and a low RMSE of 1.21, improving the accuracy of previous
   literature for estimating urban temperatures. The methodology is
   applicable for any geographical location around the world, with
   different climates or population densities. In addition, it offers a
   precise way to verify the real impact of UHI mitigation strategies and
   concentrate climate change mitigation efforts.},

Abstract = {Health systems worldwide need to be adapted to cope with growing numbers
   of migrants and to climate-exacerbated morbidity. Heatwaves, water
   stress, desertification, flooding, and sea level rise are environmental
   stressors that increase morbidity, mortality, and poor mental health in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. While most migration is intra-African, climate
   change is also affecting migration patterns outside the continent. To
   tackle the health challenges induced by these events, such as infectious
   diseases and malnutrition, health care providers in Sub-Saharan Africa
   and in receiving countries in Europe must adapt their systems to provide
   appropriate health services to these communities. While health systems
   differ greatly across the global north and south, adaptation measures
   are similar and should be integrated. We present recommendations for
   adaptation of health systems to climate-related migration, including
   strengthening health systems, providing access to healthcare,
   culturally-appropriate services, policy-oriented research and training,
   and inter-sectoral collaboration.},

Title = {A simulation/optimization study to assess seawater intrusion management

Abstract = {Seawater intrusion is one of the major threats to freshwater resources
   in coastal areas, often exacerbated by groundwater overexploitation.
   Mitigation measures are needed to properly manage aquifers, and to
   restore groundwater quality. This study integrates three computational
   tools into a unified framework to investigate seawater intrusion in
   coastal areas and to assess strategies for managing groundwater
   resources under natural and human-induced stresses. The three components
   are a three-dimensional hydrogeological model for density-dependent
   variably saturated flow and miscible salt transport, an automatic
   calibration procedure that uses state variable outputs from the model to
   estimate selected model parameters, and an optimization module that
   couples a genetic algorithm with the simulation model. The computational
   system is used to rank alternative strategies for mitigation of seawater
   intrusion, taking into account conflicting objectives and problem
   constraints. It is applied to the Gaza Strip (Palestine) coastal aquifer
   to identify a feasible groundwater management strategy for the period
   2011-2020. The optimized solution is able to: (1) keep overall future
   abstraction from municipal groundwater wells close to the user-defined
   maximum level, (2) increase the average groundwater heads, and (3) lower
   both the total mass of salt extracted and the extent of the areas
   affected by seawater intrusion.},

Abstract = {Storm surges are responsible for great damage to coastal property and
   loss of life every year. Coastal management and adaptation practices are
   essential to reduce such damage. Numerical models provide a useful tool
   for informing these practices as they simulate sea level with high
   spatial resolution. Here we investigate the ability of a barotropic
   version of the HAMSOM model to simulate sea level extremes of
   meteorological origin in the Mediterranean Sea, including those caused
   by explosive cyclones. For this purpose, the output of the model is
   compared to hourly sea level observations from six tide gauge records
   (Valencia, Barcelona, Marseille, Civitavecchia, Trieste, and Antalya).
   It is found that the model underestimates the positive extremes
   significantly at all stations, in some cases by up to 65\%. At Trieste,
   the model can also sometimes overestimate the extremes significantly.
   The differences between the model and the residuals are not constant for
   extremes of a given height, which limits the applicability of the
   numerical model for storm surge forecasting because calibration is
   difficult. The 50 and 10 year return levels are reasonably well captured
   by the model at all stations except Barcelona and Marseille, where they
   are underestimated by over 30\%. The number of exceedances of the 99.9th
   and 99.95\% percentiles over a period of 25 years is severely
   underestimated by the model at all stations. The skill of the model for
   predicting the timing and value of the storm surges seems to be higher
   for the events associated with explosive cyclones at all stations.},

Abstract = {Fossil-fuel burning and deforestation have emerged as principal
   anthropogenic sources of rising atmospheric CO2 and consequential global
   warming. Variability in temperature, precipitation, snow cover, sea
   level and extreme weather events provide collateral evidence of global
   climate change. I review recent advances on causes and consequences of
   global climate change and its impact on nature and society. I also
   examine options for climate change mitigation. Impact of climate change
   on ecology, economy and society the three pillars of sustainability - is
   increasing. Emission reduction, although most useful, is also
   politically sensitive for economic reasons. Proposals of the
   geoengineering for iron fertilization of oceans or manipulation of solar
   flux using stratospheric scatters are yet not feasible for scientific
   and environmental reasons. Forests as carbon sinks, therefore, are
   required to play a multifunctional role that includes, but is not
   limited to, biodiversity conservation and maintenance of ecosystem
   functions; yield of goods and services to the society; enhancing the
   carbon storage in trees, woody vegetation and soils; and providing
   social and economic well-being of people. This paper explores strategies
   in that direction and concludes that the management of multifunctional
   forests over landscape continuum, employing tools of conservation
   biology and restoration ecology, shall be the vital option for climate

Abstract = {Maritime ports are critical nodes in global supply network. Marine
   terminals provide the interface and connection between waterside and
   landside transport modes for the movement of cargo and passengers. These
   terminals are exposed to variety of organizational and environmental
   risks that may disrupt its services and potentially result in large
   amounts of direct and indirect financial losses. Maritime security
   investments must consider many perspectives, but the base purpose is to
   maintain a normal flow of maritime freight and passengers for business
   continuity. Security investments are made to reduce the risk of service
   disruptions and to restore operations to prior levels of service
   following a disruption. It is impractical to provide 100\% security
   against all kinds of disruptions. Hence, resiliency options are needed
   which will, in case of any disruptive event, aide the facility to bounce
   back to normal operational capacity with a faster recovery time. An
   economic resiliency assessment (ERA) framework helps evaluate
   alternative course of actions and its resiliency benefits for marine
   terminals. This paper uses a systems thinking approach to create an ERA
   framework for evaluating cost and benefits for the maritime security
   investments options. ERA framework template can be applied to many other
   marine terminals or supply networks to help decision-makers create
   investment strategies for allocation of available finance in maritime
   security and business continuity plan.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The world's coastlines are shaped by mean sea level, wave conditions,
   storm surge, and riverfiows. Climate change (CC) driven variations in
   these environmental forcings will inevitably have a profound effect on
   the coastal zone. Given the continued growth of coastal communities and
   extremely high value of coastal assets worldwide, effective adaptation
   measures underpinned by reliable coastal CC impact assessments are
   essential to avoid massive future coastal zone losses. This review aims
   to promote the adoption of best practice in local scale assessments of
   potential physical impacts of CC on open sandy coasts by (a) summarising
   the potential first order physical impacts of CC, (b) suggesting a
   standard modelling framework for local scale CC impact assessments, (c)
   identifying future research needs to facilitate the effective
   implementation of the prescribed modelling framework, (d) suggesting
   ways to address the identified research needs, and (e) discussing how
   existing methods/tools may be used for CC impact assessments until more
   advanced methods/tools are developed. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by

Abstract = {This study performs a comparison between models with and without
   well-resolved stratosphere on the simulation of the East Asian winter
   climate. The results reveal that the Fifth Coupled Model
   Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) models with model top above the
   stratopause have a better simulation of the distribution of surface air
   temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation than the models with a
   low-top below the stratopause. The discrepancy of the East Asian winter
   climate between high-top (HT) and low-top (LT) CMIP5 models is also
   evident in the future projection under higher (RCP85) and midrange
   (RCP45) emission scenarios. The HT models present about 1.3 and 1.7
   degrees C higher surface air temperature in East Asian region under
   RCP45 and RCP 85 scenarios by the end of this century than that of the

Title = {From land to sea: Governance-management lessons from terrestrial
   restoration research useful for developing and expanding
   social-ecological marine restoration},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {64-71},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal regions are complex social-ecological systems (SESs) critically
   important for their diverse and invaluable services for human
   well-being. The marked losses of these systems on a global scale has led
   to proposals for the protection of healthy habitats which, however, have
   proven to be less than completely successful, thereby necessitating the
   restoration of impacted habitats. Although the effective delivery of
   restored ecosystem services or natural capital is determined by
   governance and management, these important topics have only rarely been
   examined (and never comparatively so) in the marine literature. Because
   marine ecological restoration is still very much in its infancy, it is
   necessary to turn to terrestrial examples for guidance. The present
   paper reviews the wider, terrestrially-based literature that has
   developed on the conceptual and practical relationships of governance to
   ecological restoration, towards an end of importing five lessons from
   this experience that might prove useful for the sustainable management
   of marine SESs, particularly in relation to the praxis of marine
   social-ecological restoration. These lessons are: avoid
   science/engineering only; instill adaptive management; hybrid governance
   models work best; establish an experienced advisory committee; and put
   stakeholders front and centre. Recommended actions needed to adopt these
   lessons include: assessing the cultural modification of the restoration
   location; including a social scientist on the restoration team;
   identifying multiple stakeholders; integrating technical knowledge of
   experts and local wisdom of residents; and implementing flexibility in
   governance to facilitate project resilience. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Perspectives on spatial representation of urban heat vulnerability},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {774},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Extreme heat, the deadliest summer weather-related hazard in the USA, is
   projected to increase in intensity, duration, frequency, and magnitude,
   especially in urban areas that account for 80\% of the population.
   Spatial visualization and representation are crucial in establishing the
   hotspots of vulnerability to the heat hazard. However, despite the
   progress in the science of vulnerability, there lacks a systematic and
   consistent conceptual framework. The quantification of variables is
   unchecked, resulting in subjective decisions regarding the weighting of
   variables, selection of indicators, and the suitability of the proxies.
   Moreover, contradicting approaches generate disparate outputs such as;
   inductive versus deductive, area-based versus population-based, and
   raster versus vector designs. The qualitative approach, meant to provide
   supplementary data, is often ignored. This review provides a perspective
   of the lacunae in the existing literature and builds on these gaps to
   derive a conceptual framework towards harmonizing theoretical and
   statistical relationships. The framework is anchored on the longitudinal
   study approach as the socioeconomic, biophysical, and geodemographic
   dimensions have an inherent temporal variance. The review calls for a
   precise and accurate depiction of heat vulnerability in urban areas to
   inform targeted adaptation and mitigation measures and the long term
   projection of coupled systems behavior. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Characterization of SDGs towards Coastal Management: Sustainability
   Performance and Cross-Linking Consequences},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and associated targets focus on
   a wide range of global issues and can be useful in coastal challenges
   such as climate change and green economic growth. The aim of this study
   is to tailor the SDGs, as a universally recognized policy framework, to
   assess the sustainability performance for coastal flood protection
   management to enhance climate-resilient and adaptable coastal
   development. To operationalize this aim, the SDG Sustainability Impact
   Score (SDG-SIS) framework was developed. Based on system functionalities
   for the land-sea interface, 38 SDGs were identified in the SDG-SIS
   framework. Given the availability of public numeric data, only 12 SDG
   targets are connected with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The
   SDG-SIS framework was applied to two different sets of cases, including
   five coastline and five sand nourishment cases. This study shows that
   the geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the two sets of
   cases should be considered in the selection of system functionalities as
   well as the consideration of SDG targets. Moreover, cross-linking
   cumulative consequences of SIS do not directly indicate the level of
   sustainability, but the individual SDG target data are essential to
   reveal the underlying details. This stresses the importance of
   prioritizing SDGs to serve as leverage for policymakers to optimize the
   climate resilience and adaptation of coastal management. The SDG-SIS
   framework enables the support of coastal policy by addressing long-term
   measures and providing a sustainable vision for future implementation.},

Abstract = {Groundwater resources play a crucial role in supplying water for
   domestic, industrial, and agricultural use. In this study ACCESS-CM2,
   HadGEM3-GC31-LL, and NESM3 were selected for validation from Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). In the following, the
   feedforward neural network was employed to predict monthly groundwater
   level (GWL) based on the emission scenarios of the sixth IPCC report
   (SSP2-4.5 and SSp5-8.5) for the next two decades (2021-2040) in the
   Sari-Neka coastal aquifer near the Caspian Sea, Iran. In this regard,
   the monthly maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and water
   table of previous month from four piezometers from 2000 to 2019 were
   used as input variables to forecast GWL. The evaluation of the three GCM
   models demonstrated that the ACCESS-CM2 provided the best values of the
   R-2 and RMSE with observation parameters. The results of r, R-2, RMSE,
   and MAE were evaluated for the model and indicated good performance of
   the model. The results also illustrated that under such mentioned
   scenarios, the mean monthly temperature would rise approximately from
   0.1-1.2 degrees C. In addition, the mean monthly precipitation is likely
   to witness changes from -10\% to 78\% in the next two decades. As a
   result, this seems to lead to improvement and recharge of groundwater
   level for the near future. The results can help managers and
   policymakers to identify adaptation strategies more precisely for basins
   with similar climates.},

Title = {Threatened protection: Sea level rise and coastal protected lands of the
   eastern United States},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {137},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Federal, state, and local governments in the United States, along with
   land trusts and other nonprofit organizations, have invested significant
   financial resources in protection of natural lands in coastal areas. As
   the climate changes, protected lands could provide increased resilience
   to coastal communities, yet climate change also poses a threat to the
   continued existence and healthy functioning of these ecosystems. The
   objectives of this research are to characterize the distribution and
   types of coastal protected lands in the eastern United States, estimate
   their exposure to sea level rise, evaluate the potential impact of this
   exposure on associated ecosystem services, and then discuss appropriate
   adaptation measures. For this, we construct an inventory of coastal
   protected lands in shoreline counties of US states along the Atlantic.
   We summarize their ownership and land cover and evaluate their exposure
   to a 3-foot (0.91 m) rise in sea level. We find substantial variation in
   the amount of lands protected in coastal shoreline counties, from a high
   of 34 percent in Florida to a low of 7 percent in Pennsylvania. Federal
   ownership is greatest in the South, whereas state ownership dominates in
   the Mid-Atlantic. Private groups own large shares of protected lands in
   Maine, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Maryland. Moving south, dominant
   land covers in protected areas shift from forests to wetlands. We find
   that one quarter of protected lands in shoreline counties will be
   affected by 3 feet of sea level rise, with substantial heterogeneity in
   exposure across states and greater impacts in southern states. Almost 50
   percent of federal lands and around 25 percent of state lands will be
   affected. While substantial proportions of estuarine wetlands and
   unconsolidated shore (beaches and dunes) are currently protected and
   provide key coastal ecosystem services, 95 and 91 percent of these
   protected systems, respectively, will be affected by 3 feet of sea level
   rise. We discuss the potential consequences and the associated
   reductions in ecosystem service provisioning from sea level rise in the
   context of current funding and adaptation planning for conservation. We
   find that some of the states facing the greatest challenges art those
   lacking plans and funding. The large heterogeneity in ownership, land
   covers, and funding across states suggests that adaptation policies for
   coastal protected lands will need to be tailored to the local context; a
   one-size fits-all approach is unlikely to be as effective. (C) 2017 The

Title = {Are coastal managers detecting the problem? Assessing stakeholder

Year = {2014},
Volume = {94},
Number = {SI},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Critical barriers to adaptation to climate change include the timely
   detection and agreed definition of problems requiring adaptive action.
   In the context of local scale coastal management in north-western
   Europe, challenges to problem detection and identification are
   exacerbated by the diffuse nature of administrative, sectoral, and legal
   rights and other professional governance obligations. Yet, if adaptation
   is to progress in a manner that is both locally legitimate and in accord
   with national policies, climate signals must be detected and climate
   impact problems framed in similar ways by two key groups; local scale
   `bottom-up' experts and decision makers, and national scale `top-down'
   scientists and policy makers. With reference to case study sites in
   Ireland and Scotland, we employ participatory modelling with coastal
   stakeholders using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to trial its potential
   in measuring and assessing stakeholder perceptions of climate
   vulnerability both individually and collectively. We found that FCM not
   only offers insight into the existing detection and framing of climate
   signals in coastal decision making but also provides a structured
   communication platform from which climate problems might be coherently
   integrated into future coastal management deliberations as the
   adaptation process matures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As a result of a combination of natural processes (e.g. strong littoral
   drift) and anthropogenic action (e.g. groins), coastal erosion is rapid
   in some areas of the western Portuguese coast. These factors together
   contribute to high coastline retreat rates and an increased erosion
   risk, despite the adoption of mitigation measures. This research
   investigates the perception criteria and risk assessment of the key
   actors affecting the coastal zone and demonstrates that those who live
   at the coast have a low perception of the urban occupation risk in
   susceptible areas and consider that engineering structures should be
   used to protect the coastline. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Ten lessons on the resilience of the EU common fisheries policy towards
   climate change and fuel efficiency - A call for adaptive, flexible and
   well-informed fisheries management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {To effectively future-proof the management of the European Union fishing
   fleets we have explored a suite of case studies encompassing the
   northeast and tropical Atlantic, the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black
   Seas. This study shows that European Union (EU) fisheries are likely
   resilient to climate-driven short-term stresses, but may be negatively
   impacted by long-term trends in climate change. However, fisheries'
   long-term stock resilience can be improved (and therefore be more
   resilient to increasing changes in climate) by adopting robust and
   adaptive fisheries management, provided such measures are based on sound
   scientific advice which includes uncertainty. Such management requires
   regular updates of biological reference points. Such updates will
   delineate safe biological limits for exploitation, providing both high
   long-term yields with reduced risk of stock collapse when affected by
   short-term stresses, and enhanced compliance with advice to avoid higher
   than intended fishing mortality. However, high resilience of the
   exploited ecosystem does not necessarily lead to the resilience of the
   economy of EU fisheries from suffering shocks associated with reduced
   yields, neither to a reduced carbon footprint if fuel use increases from
   lower stock abundances. Fuel consumption is impacted by stock
   development, but also by changes in vessel and gear technologies, as
   well as fishing techniques. In this respect, energy-efficient fishing
   technologies already exist within the EU, though implementing them would
   require improving the uptake of innovations and demonstrating to
   stakeholders the potential for both reduced fuel costs and increased
   catch rates. A transition towards reducing fuel consumption and costs
   would need to be supported by the setup of EU regulatory instruments.
   Overall, to effectively manage EU fisheries within a changing climate,
   flexible, adaptive, well-informed and well-enforced management is
   needed, with incentives provided for innovations and ocean literacy to
   cope with the changing conditions, while also reducing the dependency of
   the capture fishing industry on fossil fuels. To support such
   management, we provide 10 lessons to characterize `win-win' fishing
   strategies for the European Union, which develop leverages in which
   fishing effort deployed corresponds to Maximum Sustainable Yield targets
   and Common Fisheries Policy minimal effects objectives. In these
   strategies, higher catch is obtained in the long run, less fuel is spent
   to attain the catch, and the fisheries have a higher resistance and
   resilience to shock and long-term factors to face climate-induced
   stresses.},

Abstract = {The Yangtze River (YR) region and cities along the river have severe
   deterioration of air quality due to urbanization and economic
   development. Black carbon (BC) has significant impacts on air quality
   and climate, however it is poorly characterized across the region. Here
   we report the first continuous measurements of BC and gaseous pollutants
   along the YR in wintertime, with an intensive observation period from
   November 21 to December 4, 2015, covering similar to 7 degrees longitude
   over the continent in China. The highly polluted periods (HPP) with NOx
   >80 mu g m(-3) indicated more localized emissions. At the western
   (longitude <118<degrees>E) and eastern (longitude >118 degrees E) ends
   of the YR valley, the HPP events reduced, mostly since the western end
   was influenced by terrain height and regional transport, and the eastern
   end was influenced by easterly oceanic or westerly continental air
   masses. In these regions, BC core size decreased by 5\%-19\% during the
   HPP, and had modes of mass median diameter in the range 120 -180 nm,
   which was found to be predominately from local sources, contrasting with
   a more consistent mode similar to 200 nm that was due to BC from mixed
   sources. A comparison of simultaneously measured data from the nearby
   monitoring stations along the river demonstrated a high consistency of
   PM2.5 over the river, which reflected the important regional impact on
   the particulate mass. This study evaluates the shipping emission and
   regional influence over the YR and may guide the policy maker on
   mitigating air pollution.

Title = {The effect of spatial proximity to cities on rural vulnerability against
   flooding: An indicator based approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Vulnerability to environmental hazards has widely been assessed in
   disaster risk science and climate change literature by integrating
   socio-economic and geographical features of a community or a place.
   However, the role of spatial proximity to cities - an important
   geographical feature - in influencing household vulnerability has not
   been scrutinized. This paper assesses how distance to cities affects the
   vulnerability of rural farming communities against flood hazard. This
   paper proposes a Vulnerability-Proximity Nexus (VPN) framework and
   operationalises it in the context of Pakistan. A household survey was
   conducted to collect primary data from three flood-affected
   sub-districts of Punjab province. A total of 325 samples were collected,
   out of which 164 samples were from villages located near to the cities
   and 161 were far from the cities. Vulnerability indices were developed
   through holistic (exposure, susceptibility, and capacity) and livelihood
   (human, social, financial, physical, and natural) perspective of
   vulnerability. Mann-Whitney U and Pearson's correlation tests were
   performed to analyse linkages between distance and vulnerability.
   Results confirmed that the distance to the cities influences the
   vulnerability of surrounding farming communities. A significant and
   positive correlation between distance to city and rural livelihood
   vulnerability was found. Rural farming communities living close to the
   cities were less vulnerable, mainly due to better transfer of services
   and facilities from cities, which has also made rural communities more
   educated, informed, financially strong, and connected with easier access
   to public and private institutions. This study highlights the importance
   of regional and rural development discourse for vulnerability and can
   help disaster managers and planners to establish synergies for designing
   effective disaster risk reduction policies and strategies.},

Abstract = {As the climate warms, stressors are developing that challenge the
   adaptive capabilities of Arctic peoples. In Nunavut, one of Canada's
   Arctic territories, increased weather variability and changes in
   physical and climatic conditions are having profound effects on
   residents. One problem is that while these changes have magnified risks
   associated with travel and land-based activities, individuals lack
   sufficiently reliable and useful information on which to base decisions.
   In this paper, we argue that weather-related risk assessment can be
   improved by integrating local and scientific weather knowledge and
   making this information accessible to residents through the creation of
   weather hazards impact advisory groups. We present a qualitative case
   study of Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, using data from participant
   observation and semi-structured interviews conducted with indigenous and
   non-indigenous long-term residents in summer 2009. We examine how
   long-term residents of Iqaluit acquire, perceive, and use both local and
   scientific weather knowledge. We find that various barriers, such as a
   lack of land-based experience, cultural and linguistic differences, and
   an absence of social networks, prevent most people from obtaining all
   the information required to make fully informed decisions about the
   risks associated with land-based activities at different locations.
   Experienced hunters are perceived to be a reliable source of
   weather-related information, while scientific weather knowledge is not
   as accessible or informative as it could be. Increasing the potential
   use of traditional and scientific hazardous weather knowledge, by making
   both more universally accessible, can enhance strategies for adapting to
   climate change in the Arctic.},

Title = {Fishing Industry Perspectives on Sea-Level Rise Risk and Adaptation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise, already occurring over Florida's coast, stands to
   generate a significant impact on the state's fishing industry and
   coastal communities, exposing vulnerable areas and populations to
   extreme events and disrupting established patterns of fishery and marine
   resource use. Using a semi-structured interview approach, this study
   evaluated fishing industry perspectives on sea-level rise risk and
   adaptation in three Florida coastal communities. The results showed that
   adaptation responses vary across industry sectors and communities and
   are strongly influenced by experience, community dynamics, and age.
   Generally, older fishers are less willing to relocate due to social
   factors, such as strong place attachment, compared to younger fishers,
   who are more likely to retreat and/or work from a less vulnerable
   location. These findings suggest that adaptation responses, while
   influenced by experience, are mediated by age, attachment to place, and
   worldviews, and that these factors need to be accounted for when
   crafting adaptation strategies across coastal communities.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to discuss the role of official
   development assistance (ODA) in improving the resilience of coastal
   communities through a case study of a marine science cooperation project
   supported by Korea International Cooperation Agency for Caribbean
   small-island developing states (SIDS). Resilience characteristics
   (social technological-environmental domain, spatial scale,
   transformability, adaptability, and self-organizing ability) were
   examined. As a result of the scale-domain matrix and cascading effect
   analysis, this project formed a multi-level governance model and
   attracted voluntary participation from various stakeholders. The role of
   this project to improve the resilience of the Caribbean was spatially
   extended from fisheries and coastal tourism infrastructure to coastal
   communities, regions, countries, and Caribbean Islands. Regarding
   aspects of transformability, adaptability, and self organizing, a
   coastal expert group (Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology)
   and an educational institution (University of the West Indies) formed a
   network to provide training programs that enable countries to acquire
   coastline monitoring technology and adapt and transit on their own. This
   study holds significance in terms of providing directions to future ODA
   projects to improve sustainable development of SIDS and quality of life

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change are invariably seen on agriculture,
   aquatic ecosystem, energy, and economics. The fishery sector on which
   livelihood of world's 36 million fishers depends is also not untouched
   but a little attention has been given to study the vulnerability of
   fisherfolk population to climate change programs. Therefore, the present
   study was envisaged to assess the vulnerability of fishers to the
   climate change in Junagadh district of Gujarat, India. The vulnerability
   of 1500 fisher household was assessed using PARS (parameter, attribute,
   resilient indicator, score) methodology, in four coastal villages namely
   Old light house, Bhidiya, Navabunder and Rajpara in Junagadh district.
   Five parameters viz., fishery, economy, social, environmental and
   development drivers have been assessed as indicators of sensitivity,
   exposure and adaptive capacity. `Economy' was found to be the most
   impacted parameter consequent to climate change followed by the `social'
   and `environmental' parameters. The results obtained reflect low
   adaptive capacity of fishers that could be attributed to lack of
   awareness, preparation, and mitigation option. Thus, the finding of the
   study could be used as a vital input while developing the policy and
   suitable action plan to combat the impacts of climate change minimizing
   the risk to fisheries sector.},

Abstract = {Global warming has received more and more attention in recent years for
   its inevitable influence on population, species, soil, ocean, water and
   so on. It is essential to investigate the urban metabolism of carbon
   emissions which is a main cause of global warming and most of it occurs
   in the process of production and living in urban areas. In this paper, a
   carbon emission metabolic network is established to explore the emission
   reduction strategies by modeling carbon dioxide flows and identifying
   the mutual relationships based on the input-output analysis.
   Specifically, Eff-Lorenz curve derived from the painting of Lorenz curve
   is developed to compare the efficiency of carbon emissions from
   different sectors. The newly developed method has been applied to
   Guangdong province to demonstrate its availability and benefit. It is
   revealed that carbon emissions mainly concentrated in the secondary and
   tertiary industries with electric power generation, manufacturing
   industry, domestic consumption and transportation ranking at the top.
   The competition relationship reveals good interactions in terms of
   emission reduction while a mutualism relationship provides effective
   pathways to mitigate carbon emissions between pairwise sectors
   simultaneously. In Guangdong province, upgrading the dean combustion
   technology in electric power generation and energy extraction sectors
   would drive other sectors to cut emissions and adjusting the production
   structure of the construction sector also contribute to achieve this
   goal. The results are expected to provide corresponding and holistic
   reference for decision makers to develop the mitigation policies.},

Abstract = {Aircraft boarding is a process mainly impacted by the boarding sequence,
   passenger behaviour and the amount of hand luggage. Whereas these
   aspects are already addressed in scientific research and operational
   improvements, the influence of infrastructural changes are only focused
   upon in the context of future aircraft design. The innovative Side-Slip
   Seat technology holds the potential for sustainably improving the
   boarding time by providing a wide aisle during the boarding progress. A
   comprehensive, validated simulation environment is used to analyse the
   benefits of this technology and an adapted boarding strategy is
   identified using evolutionary algorithms. Considering the operational
   reality of the air transportation domain (e.g. seat load), the
   individual passenger behaviour (e.g. conformance to procedures), and
   operational deviations (e.g. delay), the Side-Slip Seat could fasten
   aircraft boarding by both 20\% shorter average boarding time and a more
   stable boarding progress (smaller standard deviation).},

   sector},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {230-235},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Mussel fanning is the largest aquaculture activity in Spain both in
   volume and value, being a key pillar for the development of the coastal
   areas in Galicia (NW Spain), where this production is concentrated. The
   available scientific knowledge suggests that in the long term the
   primary productivity of the Galician estuaries will be reduced due to
   climate change. Consequently, adaptive management will be required to
   face this challenge. The impact of the likely production decrease will
   depend, among other factors, on the availability of substitutes, being
   their identification the main object of this research. So, it was
   analysed whether this markets are integrated or not through
   cointegration tests, finding that only the French and the Spanish
   markets are partially integrated. This implies that since very little
   substitutes are available for the Galician fresh mussels, decreases in
   production will not necessarily affect producer's income, as prices
   increases will compensate the (eventual) reduction in volume. In terms
   of policy, this study suggests that market intelligence may contribute
   to an adaptive, pragmatic and flexible framework to face climate change
   impacts, avoiding too anticipated or blind responses that may result in
   economic, environmental and social costs.},

Abstract = {Florida's Miami-Dade County is extremely vulnerable to rising seas, and
   its options for adaptation are limited. One of the biggest challenges
   facing residents of the region is to overcome psychological barriers to
   climate action. Humans have natural biases that favor the present over
   the future, strongly held opinions over new information, and certainty
   over uncertainty. These biases make it easy for people to learn from
   experience, but difficult for them to imagine and internalize future
   threats such as sea-level rise. Nevertheless, South Florida is moving
   forward with plans to address sea-level rise through new investments,
   climate change projections, and partnerships. These are hopeful signs
   that Miami and other communities are coming to rely on the best
   available science, rather than on past experience, to cope with

   agriculture, fisheries, ecosystem, and livelihoods of this region. To
   ensure the availability of food as well as drinking water, this chapter
   highlights how individual and community people have endeavored several
   adaptation measures to minimize salinity effects. Moreover, it further
   discloses governmental and other development organizations' actions
   toward salinity to reduce its impacts.},

Abstract = {Adapting to climate change means adapting the way we do things - in all
   areas of our lives - to respond to the changing circumstances
   (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), What is
   adaptation?
   http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climate/adaptation/what.htm 2008).
   Adaptation is fundamentally a local issue - flooding, coastal erosion,
   agricultural patterns, employment, regeneration and land use all impact
   the local level. It is now recognised that local governments have an
   important role in grappling with the complex impacts of climate change
   and setting in motion plans for their services and communities.
   Councillors (elected members) play a key role in championing adaptation
   at the local level. Their ongoing enthusiasm in driving forward the
   green agenda, their awareness of the risks of business as usual and
   their passion for community wellbeing puts them in the best position to
   develop public awareness of, and the political will, for taking action
   on adaptation. This paper identifies councillors' leadership role in the
   adaptation agenda. It presents a checklist with five suggested actions
   for councillors. On communicating the adaptation agenda to the public,
   councillors could use more simple language, give practical examples and
   use more innovative channels of communications. On supporting their
   councils to take action, councillors could present a business case for
   adaptation and help build partnerships for delivery.},

Abstract = {In Australia, heatwaves are more deadly than any other natural hazard
   and predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of
   climate change. Heatwaves are directly connected to human health through
   heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
   Vulnerable people, particularly those without effective cooling in their
   homes, are at high risk of illness or death during heatwaves. Heat
   refuges-typically air-conditioned or cooled buildings that have been
   designated as a site to provide respite and safety during extreme
   heat-are commonly used in the Northern Hemisphere for vulnerable people
   during heatwaves but are less prevalent in Australia. In Australia, heat
   refuges tend to be managed by local councils as part of local planned
   climate adaptation measures. This article discusses the development of a
   heat refuge strategy in Blacktown City Local Government Area in western
   Sydney. Blacktown City has higher summer average temperatures than
   coastal Sydney, caused by its local geography and urban heat island
   effects that limit the inflow of cooler coastal winds. The draft
   Blacktown City heat refuge strategy is based on some of the key
   components of disaster risk reduction including risk assessment, early
   warning systems, emergency management planning, evacuation centres and
   community participation.},

Abstract = {Natural hazards play an increasingly important role in societal contexts
   due to rising casualties and costs observed in the last decades, which
   is often attributed to Climate Change impacts. Climate Change adaptation
   and natural hazards have entered European regional policy relatively
   recently but are quickly growing in importance. In addition to several
   national and regional Climate Change adaptation strategies the
   Territorial Agenda of the European Union and the EU White Paper on
   Climate Change Adaptation mention Climate Change and hazard related risk
   management as key role in European regional development. But in this
   argument it is often overlooked that human societies have developed
   settlements in hazard prone areas, sometimes despite better knowledge.
   Spatial planning could be a very useful tool to protect settlements from
   hazard impacts but its full range of potential is seldom applied or
   overruled by other priorities. It is of interest to observe how human
   beings have dealt with various natural hazards since the beginning of
   societies, first of all to understand motivations, and secondly to use
   this knowledge for new adaptation concepts, including potential impacts
   of Climate Change. The decision making processes that lead to hazard
   adaptation concepts are one of the key foci, as well as the
   possibilities and feasibilities to integrate Climate Change adaptation
   concepts. Concrete examples of human increases in vulnerabilities and
   the development of adaptation concepts are given from a case study in
   the Baltic Sea Region.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {This paper reports sea level rise (SLR) scenarios causing land loss,
   environmental degradation and destruction of infrastructure in the Saudi
   coast of the Arabian Gulf. Human development structures such as, sea
   ports, desalination plants, industrial establishments, commercial
   buildings, fish farms etc. will be impacted, leading to great economic
   losses. A systematic analysis on the current environmental setting of
   east coast of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) versus the existing
   infrastructure assets indicates that a 1 m sea level rise in Arabian
   Gulf affects approximately 650 km(2) land area, along the Saudi
   coastline of similar to 1,800 km in 1:50,000 scale. Three simulation
   scenarios were created with respect to 1 m, 2 m and 3 m rises from the
   present mean sea level and its impacts were assessed. Maps depicting
   major infrastructure assets, ecologically sensitive elements, historical
   locations, anthropogenic zones, and Environmental Sensitivity Indices
   (ESI) were used for overlaying the sea level change map, in a Geographic
   Information System (GIS) platform. In general, the Jubail Marine Park
   area will have serious impact due to SLR. The inundation of low-lying
   lands will affect the mangroves species of Dawhat Ad Dafi, coral reefs,
   coastal salt marshes, groundwater aquifers, and fish stocks. The risk of
   inundation on the Abu Ali Island, given their status as marine sanctuary
   of international importance, is particularly high. As an adaptation
   strategy, it is proposed that the KSA should implement Integrated
   Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZMP) for the Arabian Gulf coast without
   further delay for the protection of its vulnerable resources and for
   sustainable development.},

Title = {A systematic review of urban climate research in cold and polar climate
   regions},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {138},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cities are at the forefront of the climate change issue and are
   responsible for about 39\% of global carbon dioxide emissions. They can
   form their own climate which is often characterized by higher
   temperatures and pollution levels, less wind, and solar access compared
   to their surroundings. This paper presents a systematic review of
   publications on cities in cold and polar climate regions as defined by
   the Kodppen-Geiger climate classification to determine the
   most-researched topics, identify sparsely incorporated research areas,
   synthesize research evidence and summarize the most important results.
   In total, 101 papers have been included, categorized, and analyzed
   according to their publication year, country, climate, topic, method,
   keywords, citations, and publication channels. The articles were
   classified into nine main topics: urban heat island (UHI) magnitude, UHI
   mitigation, other UHI related, biometeorology, air pollution, urban
   boundary layer and atmospheric boundary layer, time series analysis,
   other urban meteorological phenomena, and research not falling under the
   previous eight categories. The most-covered topic was the UHI effect.
   The outweighing part of studies used on-site measurements for obtaining
   data, while some studies were dedicated to understanding the structure,
   or the temporal and spatial variability of the UHI, often by using
   numerical tools. The review reveals significant gaps in the research of
   microclimatic characteristics and physical properties of the materials
   in urban design. Ongoing climate change and the particular vulnerability
   of cold and polar climate regions makes it especially important to
   review, develop, and adopt climate adaption and mitigation strategies
   for sustainable urban development.},

Volume = {94},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A slow rate of economic development and a national commitment to
   sustainable development has enabled Cuba to maintain some of the best
   preserved marine ecosystems in the Caribbean region. Still, important
   environmental threats persist, at the same time that changes in the rate
   and magnitude of marine environmental impacts are occurring because of
   increased globalization, new relations between Cuba and the United
   States, and efforts to reform Cuba's economic model. Since Cuba lacks an
   explicit overarching national ocean policy, marine conservation is
   implemented through a combination of policy instruments. We evaluated
   nine major policy instruments to understand whether and how they create
   conditions for sustainable use and conservation of marine resources. Our
   evaluation is based on five key attributes identified in the literature:
   attention to multiple levels of ecological organization, operation at
   multiple spatial scales, coordination of interacting uses, adoption of
   precautionary and adaptive approaches, and establishment of a sound
   scientific basis for management. Although our evaluation suggests that
   Cuba's marine environmental-policy framework is relatively strong, with
   individual policies scoring on average 68\% of the maximum for the five
   key attributes, we found a marked bias toward terrestrial ecosystems and
   issues. We also found that too little attention is paid to the inclusion
   of precautionary and adaptive approaches, which received a score of
   22\%, a significant deficiency in the face of ongoing ecological and
   socioeconomic changes. Cuba should develop a forward-looking national
   ocean policy that integrates existing and future laws and policies, as
   current limitations in the policy framework could undermine the
   country's ability to achieve its sustainability and environmental
   protection goals as economic development pressures grow.},

Abstract = {The establishment and alteration of any coastal feature is largely
   dependent upon complex hydrological and geomorphologic processes.
   Therefore, understanding hazard factors and threat risk level is crucial
   for mitigating risk in coastal zones. This study examines coastal
   vulnerability factors and their influence along the Coastal Andhra
   Pradesh (CAP) region in India. CAP has been exposed to frequent
   hydrological and meteorological hazards due to variations in the
   geographical, geological, and bathymetric characteristics. Despite
   substantial vulnerabilities, the risk to the coastline of Andhra Pradesh
   has not been rigorously evaluated. The current research systematically
   reviews the drivers and effects of hazards and vulnerabilities in CAP.
   Findings indicate that urban cities have a considerably higher risk of
   cyclones and floods due to their locations on the Bay of Bengal tectonic
   plate, the topology of this coastal region, and higher population
   density. The study revealed that the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI)
   data along CAP is mostly gathered using low-resolution satellite data
   and/or field observation surveys. The study further revealed that there
   are very few existing mitigation strategies developed or discussed
   within the obtained results. However, more accurate data gathering
   techniques for coastal vulnerability factors are available such as
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Air-borne and LiDAR sensors, which
   provide very high resolution data and low-cost accessibility to
   physically inaccessible places, making them suitable for vulnerability
   data collection in coastal locations. These findings are useful for
   stakeholders seeking to reduce or ameliorate the impact of coastal
   disasters and their impacts on the CAP economy, environment, and
   population. The study further helps to reduce the existing shortcomings
   in the assessment techniques used previously.},

Abstract = {Environmental carrying capacity (ECC) provides an insight into measuring
   sustainability of the vulnerable coral reef islands. However, an
   integrated assessment of ECC on the social-ecological system of reef

   the difference of social development, which would lead to a
   misinterpretation of sustainable development of reef island system. This
   study develops an evolving model of RI-ECC which incorporates five
   specific development phases, and the assessment involves (1)
   identification and measurement of carrying components, (2) supply/demand
   surplus analysis of indicators and (3) ECC states determination. A case
   study is conducted in Zhaoshu Island of China, indicating the efficiency
   of RI-ECC model and serving as a reference for adaptive management.},

Title = {Impacts of sea level rise on wave overtopping rates around the coast of
   England},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MARITIME ENGINEERING},
Abstract = {There is unequivocal evidence that global sea levels are rising. It is
   therefore inevitable there will be socioeconomic impacts as a result of
   this. To aid mitigation, and the implementation of adaptation measures,
   it is vital the magnitude of the potential impact is quantified. Current
   approaches in the UK make simplifying assumptions regarding the
   relationship between present-day and future economic damage relating to
   coastal flood risk. The analysis undertaken here supports studies of an
   improved impact of sea level rise by providing national-scale estimates
   of changes in wave overtopping rates and flood defence overflow rates,
   as a result of different amounts of sea level rise. The analysis
   involves the application of components of an existing risk-based coastal
   flood risk analysis method. A subset of almost 600 flood defence assets
   around the country has been analysed for sea level rise rates up to 1 m.
   The resulting analysis shows that, on average, the wave overtopping rate
   increases by up to 150 times above present-day rates for lower return
   periods and by up to five times for higher return periods. This
   differential arises as a result of non-linearities in overtopping rates
   with increasing extreme sea levels.},

Abstract = {Green roofs and rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are two popular
   mitigation strategies to reduce the net building energy demand and ease
   urban heat island (UHI) effect. This research tested the potential
   mitigation effects of green roofs and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on
   increased buildings energy demand caused by climate change in Los
   Angeles County, California, USA. The mitigation effects were assessed
   based on selected buildings that were predicted to be more vulnerable to
   climate change. EnergyPlus software was used to simulate hourly building
   energy consumption with the proper settings of PV-green roofs. All
   buildings with green roofs showed positive energy savings with regard to
   total energy and electricity. The savings caused by green roofs were
   positively correlated with three key parameters: Leaf Area Index (LAI),
   soil depth, and irrigation saturation percentage. Moreover, the majority
   of the electricity-saving benefits from green roofs were found in the
   Heating, Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC) systems. In addition, this
   study found that green roofs have different energy-saving abilities on
   different types of buildings with different technologies, which has
   received little attention in previous studies.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC's) Paris
   Agreement-which aims to limit climate change and increase global
   resilience to its effects-was a breakthrough in climate diplomacy,
   committing its Parties to develop and update national climate plans. Yet
   the Parties to the Agreement have largely overlooked the effect of
   climate change on ocean-based communities, economies, and ecosystems-as
   well as the role that the ocean can play in mitigating and adapting to
   climate change. Because the ocean is an integral part of the climate
   system, stronger inclusion of ocean issues is critical to achieving the
   Agreement's goals. Here we discuss four ocean-climate linkages that
   suggest specific responses by Parties to the Agreement connected to 1)
   accelerating climate ambition, including via sustainable ocean-based
   mitigation strategies; 2) focusing on CO2 emissions to address ocean
   acidification; 3) better understanding ocean-based mitigation; and 4)
   pursuing ocean-based adaptation. These linkages offer a more complete
   perspective on the reasons strong climate action is necessary and inform
   a systematic approach for addressing ocean issues under the Agreement to
   strengthen climate mitigation and adaptation.},

Pages = {887-903},

Abstract = {Genetic adaptation-heritable changes that alter an organism's
   performance-may facilitate invasion at several scales, but is seldom
   considered in predicting and managing marine invasions. However, a
   growing body of research-largely based on emerging genetic
   approaches-suggests that adaptation is possible and potentially
   widespread in the marine realm. Here, I review evidence for adaptation
   in marine invasion, considering both quantitative and genetic studies.
   Quantitative studies, which consider trait-based differences between
   populations or individuals without directly examining genetic makeup,
   have suggested local adaptation in several high-profile species. This
   implies that invasion risk may not be constant from population to
   population within a species, a key assumption of most invasion models.
   However, in many quantitative studies, the effects of heritable adaptive
   changes may be confounded with the effects of plasticity. Molecular
   approaches can help disentangle these effects, and studies at the
   genomic level are beginning to elucidate the specific genetic patterns
   and pathways underlying adaptation in invasion. While studies at this
   scale are currently rare in the marine invasion literature, they are
   likely to become increasingly prevalent-and useful-now that
   next-generation sequencing approaches have become tractable in non-model
   systems. Both traditional and emerging genetic approaches can improve
   our understanding of adaptation in marine invasions, and can aid
   managers in making accurate predictions of invasion spread and risk.},

Volume = {123},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Local communities across the Pacific Island region have long prepared
   for and managed extreme weather events. Strategies to cope with extreme
   weather, particularly cyclones and droughts, have involved using
   particular planting techniques, initiating innovative water storage
   practices, and employing food preservation tactics to survive. These
   local experiences and knowledge have been passed on between generations
   through stories and sharing practical know-how; however, very little
   formal documentation has transpired to date. This research attempts to
   document and synthesis these experiences and knowledge to safeguard them
   through written accounts but also demonstrate how Pacific communities
   can provide valuable, appropriate and effective strategies to prepare
   for and respond to extreme weather events. In-depth interviews (n = 40)
   were conducted with community members from three villages in Fiji
   (Naselesele, Qeleni and Yanuca) and three villages in Vanuatu (Piliura,
   Tassiriki and Lonamilo). While typically missing from community
   vulnerability and risk assessments in the Pacific, local experiences and
   knowledge are a core strength in enhancing adaptive capacity and
   planning community-based activities.},

Title = {The Photovoltaic Heat Island Effect: Larger solar power plants increase
   local temperatures},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {While photovoltaic (PV) renewable energy production has surged, concerns
   remain about whether or not PV power plants induce a ``heat island{''}
   (PVHI) effect, much like the increase in ambient temperatures relative
   to wildlands generates an Urban Heat Island effect in cities.
   Transitions to PV plants alter the way that incoming energy is reflected
   back to the atmosphere or absorbed, stored, and reradiated because PV
   plants change the albedo, vegetation, and structure of the terrain.
   Prior work on the PVHI has been mostly theoretical or based upon
   simulated models. Furthermore, past empirical work has been limited in
   scope to a single biome. Because there are still large uncertainties
   surrounding the potential for a PHVI effect, we examined the PVHI
   empirically with experiments that spanned three biomes. We found
   temperatures over a PV plant were regularly 3-4 degrees C warmer than
   wildlands at night, which is in direct contrast to other studies based
   on models that suggested that PV systems should decrease ambient
   temperatures. Deducing the underlying cause and scale of the PVHI effect
   and identifying mitigation strategies are key in supporting
   decision-making regarding PV development, particularly in semiarid
   landscapes, which are among the most likely for large-scale PV
   installations.},

Abstract = {Social vulnerability and resilience indices identify populations who are
   at risk from hazards in order to guide policy to build resilience. This
   study investigates which of the indicators that commonly comprise the
   indices reflect vulnerability and resilience to coastal flooding in
   urban areas based on primary data that document the impacts of and
   recovery from Hurricane Sandy in New York City. The study constructs
   measures of vulnerability and resilience that are independent of
   proposed indicators and uses regression analysis to investigate which
   indicators influence these measures. The analysis finds that (1) middle-
   and low-income homeowners are less financially resilient than are poorer
   renters. The recovery cost middle- to low-income homeowners 2.4 times
   their annual per capita incomes, while renters paid out about half of
   their per capita incomes. Resilience increases with income but
   conditional on ownership of assets that are at risk. (2) Disabled and/or
   chronically ill residents are more vulnerable and less resilient by many
   outcome measures. (3) Non-white households experience longer disruptions
   of access to food. (4) Information, hazard-specific capacities of
   community groups, and pre-hazard access to services such as food and
   health care are important indicators of vulnerability and resilience.
   (5) The evidence that other commonly proposed indicators are correlated
   with independent measures of vulnerability and resilience to flooding is
   weak. The study yields hypotheses for further research on how relevant
   indicators differ across hazards and contexts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {23-47},
Abstract = {The current study contributes a political ecology of culture clash
   approach to the research on amenity-led development (ALD) in coastal
   areas. Coastal areas are characterized by high population growth, yet
   are prone to natural disasters, which are projected to increase as
   coasts erode, and seas rise and warm. Collaboration between newer and
   longer-term residents on hazard mitigation measures is increasingly
   important, but the ALD literature is replete with conflict, divisions,
   and increased vulnerability. The current study applies concepts from two
   lines of ALD scholarship, the culture clash literature and political
   economy approaches, to a case study of a traditional commercial fishing
   community undergoing ALD in North Carolina. Findings demonstrate that
   newer and longer-term residents share a concern for environmental harm,
   but misunderstandings and sense of place differences fuel conflict,
   while broader drivers of coastal development shape the landscape of
   vulnerability and risk. A significant contribution of this study is the
   exposition that ALD is not environmentally or politically neutral. There
   are significant consequences for environmental integrity, social
   vulnerability, and risk and hazard mitigation measures in who wins and
   who loses from culture clash politics, which belie the viability of
   cooperation based on common ground. However, making the terrain of
   politics visible reveals allies and resources for improving resilience

Title = {Future changes in climate indices relevant to agriculture in the Aegean
   islands (Greece)},
Journal = {EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Aegean islands, characterized by strong relief and low vegetation
   cover, are listed as a region of high desertification risk. Impacts of
   climate change are expected to affect significantly agricultural
   production and the local economy. In this paper, projections derived
   from seven regional climate models (RCMs) are used to examine future
   climate changes in the Aegean area to identify areas most vulnerable to
   climate change and to prioritize future interventions in the
   agricultural sector. Changes in climate indices, derived from the mean
   ensemble of the seven RCMs, are examined under the medium mitigation
   (RCP4.5) and the high emission scenario (RCP8.5) for the control
   (1971-2000), near (2031-2060) and distant (2071-2100) future periods.
   Ensemble results are calibrated against the long-term historical
   meteorological record of Naxos Island in the central Cyclades. Annual
   averaged maximum and minimum temperatures show increases of about 1.5
   degrees C (RCP4.5) or 2.1 degrees C (RCP8.5) in the near future and
   almost 2.2 degrees C (RCP4.5) or 4.5 degrees C (RCP8.5) in the distant
   future across the Aegean. Hot days and very hot days (days with T-max >
   30 degrees C and T-max > 35 degrees C, respectively) which negatively
   affect plant growth are projected to increase considerably, especially
   in the distant future. Hot days will be more frequent by 30-60 days/year
   (RCP4.5-RCP8.5), and very hot days by about 10-30 days/year
   (RCP4.5-RCP8.5) across the Aegean for the period 2071-2100. Total annual
   precipitation decreases significantly throughout the Aegean islands in
   the distant future, by 15-25\%, while increases in the maximum length of
   dry spells are projected. Under both RCP scenarios they will last about
   100 days, which is 20 days more than in the reference period. Results of
   this study feed into recommendations for adaptation measures that are to
   be integrated into agricultural policy which is formulated by the
   TERRACESCAPE project.},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {The past five years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of media
   and scientific publications on the topic of climate engineering, or
   geoengineering, and some scientists are increasingly calling for more
   research on climate engineering as a possible supplement to climate
   change mitigation and adaptation strategies. In this context,
   understanding the current state of climate engineering research can help
   inform policy discussions and guide future research directions.
   Bibliometric analysisthe quantitative analysis of publicationsis
   particularly applicable to fields with large bodies of literature that
   are difficult to summarize by traditional review methods. The
   multidisciplinary nature of the published literature on climate
   engineering makes it an ideal candidate for bibliometric analysis.
   Publications on climate engineering are found to be relatively recent
   (more than half of all articles during 1988-2011 were published since
   2008), include a higher than average percentage of nonresearch articles
   (30\% compared with 8-15\% in related scientific disciplines), and be
   predominately produced by countries located in the Northern Hemisphere
   and speaking English. The majority of this literature focuses on
   land-based methods of carbon sequestration, ocean iron fertilization,
   and solar radiation management and is produced with little collaboration
   among research groups. This study provides a summary of existing
   publications on climate engineering, a perspective on the scientific
   underpinnings of the global dialogue on climate engineering, and a
   baseline for quantitatively monitoring the development of climate
   engineering research in the future. (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Mind the gap in SEA: An institutional perspective on why assessment of
   synergies amongst climate change mitigation, adaptation and other policy
   areas are missing},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-40},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article takes its point of departure in two approaches to
   integrating climate change into Strategic Environmental Assessment
   (SEA): Mitigation and adaptation, and in the fact that these, as well as
   the synergies between them and other policy areas, are needed as part of
   an integrated assessment and policy response. First, the article makes a
   review of how positive and negative synergies between a) climate change
   mitigation and adaptation and b) climate change and other environmental
   concerns are integrated into Danish SEA practice. Then, the article
   discusses the implications of not addressing synergies. Finally, the
   article explores institutional explanations as to why synergies are not
   addressed in SEA practice. A document analysis of 149 Danish SEA reports
   shows that only one report comprises the assessment of synergies between
   mitigation and adaptation, whilst 9,4\% of the reports assess the
   synergies between climate change and other environmental concerns. The
   consequences of separation are both the risk of trade-offs and missed
   opportunities for enhancing positive synergies. In order to propose
   explanations for the lacking integration, the institutional background
   is analysed and discussed, mainly based on Scott's theory of
   institutions. The institutional analysis highlights a regulatory
   element, since the assessment of climate change synergies is underpinned
   by legislation, but not by guidance. This means that great focus is on
   normative elements such as the local interpretation of legislation and
   of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The analysis also focuses
   on how the fragmentation of the organisation in which climate change and
   SEA are embedded has bearings on both normative and cultural-cognitive
   elements. This makes the assessment of synergies challenging. The
   evidence gathered and presented in the article points to a need for
   developing the SEA process and methodology in Denmark with the aim to
   include climate change in the assessments in a more systematic and
   integrated manner. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The social-ecological dimension of vulnerability and risk to natural
   hazards},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {587-604},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The impacts of natural hazards on local communities are increasing
   worldwide and are projected to rise further due to urban expansion and
   climate change. To address these threats, a large amount of literature
   has characterized and assessed the physical, social, economic and
   institutional dimensions of disaster risk. However, much less attention
   has been paid to the social-ecological dimension of vulnerability and
   risk. The lack of consideration of this dimension represents a major
   knowledge gap, especially when considering that environmental
   degradation is regarded as one of the primary drivers of risk to natural
   hazards worldwide. While the international community advocates for the
   restoration of ecosystems as an important strategy for disaster risk
   reduction, the relationship between environmental health, vulnerability
   and risk of populations is often overlooked in vulnerability and risk
   assessment, a precondition for the design and implementation of
   effective ecosystem-based adaptation strategies. Possible explanations
   for this gap are: (1) the contradictory results on the role of ecosystem
   health in determining risk of local communities; (2) the poor
   theoretical framing of the social-ecological dimension of vulnerability
   and risk to natural hazards; or (3) the lack of clarity regarding how to
   assess this dimension of risk. This paper addresses potential reasons
   (2) and (3). It first reviews the available literature related to
   social-ecological drivers of vulnerability and risk of local communities
   exposed to natural hazards. Second, it discusses and provides a
   definition of social-ecological vulnerability and risk. Third, it
   reviews assessment methods and, finally, it suggests an improved
   conceptual framework that illustrates the main interactions between
   natural hazards, the ecosystem and the social system.},

Abstract = {A case study report of the good practices of the Sri Lankan Early
   Warning System (EWS) was prepared for the ANDROID Disaster Resilience
   Network funded by the EU Lifelong Learning Programme. The objective was
   to highlight good practices, identify gaps and useful recommendations
   (within an up-to-date and comprehensive context) to achieve disaster
   resilient governance. The EWS components; Infrastructure, Risk Knowledge
   (i.e. Hazard, Vulnerability and Risk Assessment), Preparedness and Early
   Warning Dissemination, Disaster Response and Coordination were
   scrutinised. These components were compared against the exemplary
   structure of a people-centred EWS to assess its efficacy in achieving
   disaster resilience. Since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami was the first
   contemporary large-scale disaster faced by Sri Lanka, it lacked the
   legislative framework and institutional capacity to respond and only
   thereafter the integration of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) was
   observed. The importance of training was demonstrated within risk
   knowledge, preparedness and early warning dissemination, and disaster
   response and coordination. Thereby training is considered crucial in
   achieving a progressive, people-centred EWS. However it can be
   consolidated through joint resource utilisation (particularly personnel)
   between organisations and creating a Continuing Professional Development
   (CPD) certification system. There has been considerable progress in
   integrating DRR into development at all levels, which is a key measure
   in achieving disaster resilience. It was notably observed in achieving
   disaster resilient development, climate change adaptation and DRR was
   integrated despite a general tendency to be polarised in other areas.
   Despite some existing projects there is a need for greater government
   and private sector engagement in ecosystem-based DRR. Finally to achieve
   a disaster resilient Sri Lankan EWS, risk transfer measures require
   further evaluation. The emergence of some disaster risk financing and
   insurance is observed but issues, such as assuring applicability to a
   local context and scientific, evidence-based underpinning, need to be
   addressed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.},

Abstract = {Climate simulation will not grow to the ultrascale without new
   algorithms to overcome the scalability barriers blocking existing
   implementations. Until recently, climate simulations concentrated oil
   the question of whether the climate is changing. The emphasis is now
   shifting to impact assessments, mitigation and adaptation strategies,
   and regional details. Such studies will require significant increases in
   spatial resolution and model complexity while maintaining adequate
   throughput. The barrier to progress is the resulting decrease in time
   step without increasing single-thread performance. In this paper we
   demonstrate how to overcome this time barrier for the first standard
   test defined for the shallow-water equations oil a sphere. This paper
   explains how combining a multiwavelet discontinuous Galerkin method with
   exact linear part time-evolution schemes can overcome the time barrier
   for advection equations oil a sphere. The discontinuous Galerkin method
   is a high-order method that is conservative, flexible, and scalable. The
   addition of multiwavelets to discontinuous Galerkin provides a
   hierarchical scale structure that; can be exploited to improve
   computational efficiency in both the spatial and temporal dimensions.
   Exact linear part time-evolution schemes are explicit schemes that
   remain stable for implicit-size time steps.},

Title = {Collaborative Engagement of Local and Traditional Knowledge and Science
   in Marine Environments: A Review},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Local and traditional ecological knowledge (LTK) is increasingly
   recognized as an important component of scientific research,
   conservation, and resource management. Especially where there are gaps
   in the scientific literature, LTK can be a critical source of basic
   environmental data; this situation is particularly apparent in the case
   of marine ecosystems, about which comparatively less is known than
   terrestrial ones. We surveyed the global literature relating to the LTK
   of marine environments and analyzed what knowledge has been collected
   and with what aims and results. A large proportion of LTK which has been
   documented by researchers consists of species-specific information that
   is important for traditional resource use. However, knowledge relating
   to marine ecology, environmental change, and contemporary resource
   management practices is increasingly emphasized in the literature.
   Today, marine LTK is being used to provide historical and contemporary
   baseline information, suggest stewardship techniques, improve
   conservation planning and practice, and to resolve management disputes.
   Still, comparatively few studies are geared toward the practicalities of
   developing a truly collaborative, adaptive, and resilient management
   infrastructure that is embracive of modern science and LTK and practices
   in marine environments. Based on the literature, we thus suggest how
   such an infrastructure might be advanced through collaborative projects
   and ``bridging{''} institutions that highlight the importance of
   trust-building and the involvement of communities in all stages of
   research, and the importance of shared interest in project objectives,
   settings (seascapes), and outcomes.},

Title = {The contribution of carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector to
   future climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The compact Earth system model OSCARv2.2 is used to assess the climate
   impact of present and future civil aviation carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions. The impact of aviation CO2 on future climate is quantified
   over the 1940-2050 period, extending some simulations to 2100 and using
   different aviation CO2 emission scenarios and two background
   Representative Concentrations Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0) for other
   emission sectors. Several aviation scenarios including weak to strong
   mitigation options are considered with emissions ranging from 386
   MtCO(2)/year (Factor 2 scenario) to 2338 MtCO(2)/year (ICAO based
   scenario) in 2050. As a reference, in 2000, the calculated impact of
   aviation CO2 emissions is 9.1 +/- 2 mK (0.8\% of the total anthropogenic
   warming associated to fossil fuel emissions). In 2050, on a climate
   trajectory in line with the Paris Agreement limiting the global warming
   below 2 degrees C (RCP2.6), the impact of the aviation CO2 emissions
   ranges from 26 +/- 2 mK (1.4\% of the total anthropogenic warming
   associated to fossil fuel emissions) for an ambitious mitigation
   strategy scenario (Factor 2) to 39 +/- 4 mK (2.0\% of the total
   anthropogenic warming associated to fossil fuel emissions) for the least
   ambitious mitigation scenario of the study (ICAO based). On the longer
   term, if no significant emission mitigation is implemented for the
   aviation sector, the associated warming could further increase and reach
   a value of 99.5 mK +/- 20 mK in 2100 (ICAO based), which corresponds to
   5.2\% of the total anthropogenic warming under RCP2.6. The contribution
   of CO2 is estimated to represent 36\%-51\% of the total aviation
   radiative forcing of climate including short-term climate forcers.
   However, due to its long residence time in the atmosphere, aviation CO2
   will have a major contribution on decadal time scales. These additional
   short-terms forcers are subject to large uncertainties and will be
   analysed in forthcoming studies.},

Abstract = {Stakeholder engagement is increasingly recognised as imperative for
   developing effective climate change adaptation policy within the EU,
   particularly for delivering sustainable coastal infrastructure. This
   perspective discusses how current transdisciplinary research (TDR)
   approaches concerning ecoengineering solutions for artificial coastal

   to facilitate coherent and enduring decision-making and policy
   development processes. Socio-cultural analysis focussing on how people
   view and feel about artificial coastal infrastructure within coastal

   suggest that citizen science (CS) methodologies as part of a cultural
   ecosystem services (CES) research approach can adequately inform and
   support the implementation of ecoengineering solutions for hard
   artificial coastal structures whilst addressing existing barriers
   associated with stakeholder engagement in current TDR approaches.},

Abstract = {Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD), the country's most important food basket, is
   constantly threatened by drought-infused salinity intrusion (SI). The SI
   disaster of 2020 is recognized as the worst in recent decades, hence
   inspiring this perspective article. The authors' viewpoints on the
   disaster's impacts and causes are presented. The arguments presented are
   mainly drawn from (i) up-to-date publications that report on the recent
   SI intensification in the VMD and (ii) the power spectral analysis
   results using water level data. We verified the intensifying SI in the
   VMD both in its frequency and magnitude and remarked on four of the key
   SI drivers: (i) upstream hydropower dams, (ii) land subsidence, (iii)
   the relative sea-level rise, and (iv) riverbed sand mining Also, a
   non-exhaustive yet list of recommendable management implications to
   mitigate the negative effects of the SI is contributed. The mitigation
   measures must be realized at multiple scales, ranging from pursuing
   transboundary water diplomacy efforts to managing internal pressures via
   developing early warnings, restricting illegal sand mining activities,
   alleviating pressures on groundwater resources, and diversifying
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {The present study described the gametogenesis and assessed the pattern
   of energy storage throughout the reproductive cycle of the golden carpet
   shell (Polititapes aureus) from the Ria Formosa lagoon (southern
   Portugal). Monthly sampling was performed for two years (March
   2016-February 2018) and the study was based on gonad histology,
   complemented by the estimation of the mean gonadal index, body condition
   index and biochemical composition. The species' reproductive cycle
   presented a seasonal pattern, with a resting period mainly between
   October and January and gametogenesis beginning around February-March.
   The spawning season of P. aureus was shorter in 2016 (June-September)
   than in 2017 (May-October). Furthermore, ripe individuals were very
   scarce (1.3\%) in 2017 compared with the previous year (11.4\%). Mean
   gonadal index (GI) reflected the species' reproductive cycle and the
   body condition index (CI) and biochemical composition of the individuals
   exhibited high variation between years. Regarding the biochemical
   composition, proteins ranged between 190.6 and 595.2 mu g mg(-1),
   glycogen from 5.7 to 102.6 mu g mg(-1) and total lipids between 31.6 and
   80.7 mu g mg(-1). The reproduction of P. aureus was strongly influenced
   by fluctuations in both seawater temperature and chlorophyll a, as
   reflected through the temporal variation in the gonadal cycle, condition
   index and biochemical composition. Overall, the information gathered in
   this study is valuable to propose scientifically based harvesting
   management measures for the long-term sustainable exploitation of this
   shellfish resource, further reinforcing the importance of implementing
   adaptive fishery management strategies to cope with global climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Pricing carbon is a widely used policy instrument for climate change
   mitigation. Quantitative analysis of carbon pricing are mainly conducted
   at the regional and national level, rarely at the city level due to data
   availability. As a representative of coastal megacities that are
   vulnerable to both climate change and climate policies, Singapore has
   announced to impose carbon tax on large direct emitters as a.
   complementary mitigation option to technical measures. A city-level
   Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is developed to simulate
   potential impacts of carbon pricing on the city, including paying border
   carbon-adjustment (BCA) on exports or introducing a domestic carbon tax.
   Different sector coverages and carbon tax revenue recycling schemes are
   investigated for domestic carbon tax. The simulation results show that a
   domestic carbon tax is a more cost-effective option than paying BCA.
   Given an identical carbon price at S\$10/t-CO2, GDP, total exports and
   household consumption would decline less and average abatement cost is
   much smaller in the carbon tax scenarios compared to the BCA scenario.
   In terms of absolute emissions reduction, a carbon tax that covers
   energy, manufacturing and land transport sectors would be preferred,
   making emissions around 2.7\% lower than 2010 baseline level. (C) 2017

Title = {Awareness of climate change's impacts and motivation to adapt are not
   enough to drive action: A look of Puerto Rican farmers after Hurricane
   Maria},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Understanding how perceptions around motivation, capacity, and climate
   change's impacts relate to the adoption of adaptation practices in light
   of experiences with extreme weather events is important in assessing
   farmers' adaptive capacity. However, very little of this work has
   occurred in islands, which may have different vulnerabilities and
   capacities for adaptation. Data of surveyed farmers throughout Puerto
   Rico after Hurricane Maria (n = 405, 87\% response rate) were used in a
   structural equation model to explore the extent to which their adoption
   of agricultural practices and management strategies was driven by
   perceptions of motivation, vulnerability, and capacity as a function of
   their psychological distance of climate change. Our results show that
   half of farmers did not adopt any practice or strategy, even though the
   majority perceived themselves capable and motivated to adapt to climate
   change, and understood their farms to be vulnerable to future extreme
   events. Furthermore, adoption was neither linked to these adaptation
   perceptions, nor to their psychological distance of climate change,
   which we found to be both near and far. Puerto Rican farmers' showed a
   broad awareness of climate change's impacts both locally and globally in
   different dimensions (temporal, spatial, and social), and climate
   distance was not linked to reported damages from Hurricane Maria or to
   previous extreme weather events. These results suggest that we may be
   reaching a tipping point for extreme events as a driver for climate
   belief and action, especially in places where there is a high level of
   climate change awareness and continued experience of compounded impacts.
   Further, high perceived capacity and motivation are not linked to actual
   adaptation behaviors, suggesting that broadening adaptation analyses
   beyond individual perceptions and capacities as drivers of climate
   adaptation may give us a better understanding of the determinants to
   strengthen farmers' adaptive capacity.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal variations of litter on Qingdao tourist beaches in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {303},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Beaches are an integral part of coastal tourism, but they are
   deteriorated by the beachgoers and recreational activities due to lack
   of adequate beach environmental awareness and management. Litter is
   widely distributed in marine and coastal environment and has been
   considered a severe concern. In China investigations to determine the
   beach litter abundance and pollution level are limited. The aim of this
   study is to estimate spatio-temporal distribution and composition of
   litter on 10 well-known Qingdao tourist beaches, involving pollution
   level by beach quality indexes. Beach litter was collected within an
   area of 25 x 25 m(2) in both summer (May, June and July) and winter
   (Nov, Dec and Jan) seasons, and was classified into eight categories.
   The abundance of beach litter was found higher in summer (0.13 +/- 0.04
   items/m(2)) than in winter (0.04 +/- 0.01 items/m(2)). Overall, the
   percentage of plastics were higher in both summer (23.48\%) and winter
   (24.04\%) than that of other litter categories. Based on Clean Coast
   Index, 70\% of beaches were very clean, 25\% clean, and 5\% moderately
   clean. Beach Grade Index showed that 15\% beaches were very good, 5\%
   good, 55\% fair, and 25\% poor. 85\% beaches constituted some quantity
   of hazardous litter and 15\% had no hazardous litter for Hazardous Items
   index. The findings suggest that the sources of beach litter along
   Qingdao beaches mainly come from the recreational and tourist
   activities. The substantial quantity of litter is also being transported
   by ocean (tides or current), which are finally deposited along
   beachfront. Despite regular cleaning operation along most of Qingdao
   beaches, suggested management practices involve mitigation measures,
   source reduction, change in littering behavior to improve further
   quality of beaches.},

Title = {Evaluating adaptation options to sea level rise and benefits to
   agriculture: The Ebro Delta showcase},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {806},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) is threatening low-lying coastal areas such as
   river deltas. The Ebro river Delta (Spain) is rep-resentative of coastal
   systems particularly vulnerable to SLR due to significant sediment
   retention behind up-stream dams (up to 99\%), thereby dramatically
   reducing the capacity for deltaic sediment accretion. Rice production is
   the main economic activity, covering 66\% of the delta area, and is
   negatively affected by SLR because of flooding and soil salinization.
   Therefore, appropriate adaptation measures are needed to preserve rice
   produc-tion. We combined Geographic Information Systems and Generalized
   Linear Models to identify zones prone to flooding and increasing soil
   salinity, and to calculate the so-called sediment deficit, that is the
   amount of sedi-ment needed to raise the land to compensate flooding and
   soil salinization. We modelled SLR scenarios predicted by the IPCC Fifth
   Assessment Report, and analysed the economic feasibility (not the
   technical feasibility) of reintroducing fluvial sediments retained in
   the upstream river dam reservoirs into the delta plain, which can
   con-tribute to maintaining land elevation and rice production with SLR.
   To do this, the costs of the sediment reintro-duction measures and their
   benefits in terms of avoided loss of rice production income were
   evaluated with an approximate economic cost-benefit analysis. Results
   predicted that between 35 and 90\% of the rice field area will be
   flooded in the best and worst SLR scenarios considered (SLR = 0.5 m and
   1.8 m by 2100, respectively), with a sediment deficit of 130 and 442
   million tonnes, with an associated cost of sediment reintroduction of 13
   and 226 million euro . The net benefit of rice production maintenance
   was 24.6 and 328 euro /ha. The proposed ad-aptation measure has a
   positive effect on rice production and can be considered as an
   innovative management option for maintaining deltaic areas under SLR.

Title = {Temporal changes in the relative abundance of anadromous Arctic charr,
   brown trout, and Atlantic salmon in northern Europe: Do they reflect
   changing climates?},

Abstract = {Warming temperatures resulting from climate change may alter the
   distribution and abundance of many freshwater fish species, especially
   those in northern latitudes. Owing to interspecific differences in
   temperature adaptations and tolerances, warming may lead to changes in
   the fish community as a result of shifts in the abundance of co-existing
   species.
   We investigated how increased temperatures have potentially affected the
   abundance and catch composition of anadromous salmonids in northern
   Europe. We used national angling catch statistics over a period of
   several decades (1993-2018) as a proxy of relative annual abundance of
   adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and
   Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in water courses in Iceland and in
   northern Norway. These are the only locations in the world where the
   three species coexist naturally as anadromous forms, and where they are
   distributed across latitudinal gradients characterised by varying
   temperatures.
   Interpolated data on average annual air temperatures proximate to the
   study rivers increased 1-1.7 degrees C in northern Norway and 1.0-1.5
   degrees C in Iceland during the 26-year study period.
   While the overall total number of fish caught has remained relatively
   stable during the period of study, gradual climate warming has been
   accompanied by a marked change in the catch composition of the three
   species in both countries. Increased temperatures were related to a
   decreased proportion of Arctic charr and an increased proportion of
   brown trout, while no temperature effect was found for Atlantic salmon.
   Controlling for the difference between fluvial and lacustrine systems,
   brown trout has begun to replace Arctic charr in all regions, whereas
   the relative catch of Atlantic salmon has been stable.
   Interpretation of angling data can facilitate understanding of
   longer-term trends in catch data and provide insights into possible
   underlying changes in fish species and alert managers to shifts in
   abundance that might be mitigated by management actions. However, care
   must be taken to avoid the confounding effects that changes in fisheries
   management measures, angler preferences, and effort might have on the
   metrics of relative change used to make inferences about long-term
   trends.},

Abstract = {In this study, a multi-criteria index was developed to assess
   anthropogenic stressors along the Mediterranean coastline. The index
   aimed at geo-locating pollution hotspots for informed decision making
   related to coastal zone management. The index was integrated in a
   Geographical Information System based geodatabase implemented at several
   pilot areas along the Northern (Italy and France), Eastern (Lebanon),
   and Southern (Tunisia) Mediterranean coastlines. The generated stressor
   maps were coupled with a biodiversity richness index and an
   environmental sensitivity index to produce vulnerability maps that can
   form the basis for prioritizing management and mitigation interventions
   towards the identification of pollution hotspots and the promotion of
   sustainable coastal zone management. The results identified significant
   differences between the two assessment methods, which can bias
   prioritization in decision making and policy planning depending on
   stakeholders' interests. The discrepancies emphasize the need for
   transparency and understanding of the underlying foundations behind
   vulnerability indices and mapping development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {An overview on elasmobranch release as a bycatch mitigation strategy},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Sharks and rays are among the most threatened vertebrates, mostly due to
   commercial fisheries. Data on incidental capture is sparse, but it is
   estimated that about 50\% of reported global catches of elasmobranchs
   are from bycatch. Elasmobranchs are captured in a variety of fishing
   gear throughout the world. One promising strategy to minimize incidental
   catches is the release of live sharks and rays. However, so far, no
   critical analysis had been carried out to assess the importance of
   release as a measure to mitigate the impacts of bycatch. Results
   indicated that despite onboard releases being cited in Plans of Action
   (along ZEEs) and recommendations/regulations of Regional Fisheries
   Management Commissions (in international waters), this measure is
   treated as secondary and has voluntary adherence, which can
   significantly reduce its efficiency. Moreover, among the Best Fishing
   Practice Manuals currently available, although release is cited as a
   priority, most of them do not consider the dynamics of the
   location/fishing modality for which it was developed. A change on how
   release is perceived is needed to prioritize this conservation strategy,
   as well as its potential as a social tool to reduce the impacts of
   bycatch on sharks and rays.},

Title = {Proposed improvement of coastal habitat resilience: The case study of
   Pantano forest of Policoro in southern Italy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {In the last decades, climate change and the rapid urbanization due to
   the development of the coastal economy have led to biodiversity loss and
   the fragmentation of habitat in many coastal zones. The presence of
   protected areas cannot prevent the progress of land degradation.
   However, these areas are very important because they provide significant
   ecosystem services and affect local tourism. With regard to increasing
   adaptation strategies to human pressures and climate change, the present
   study proposes a detailed monitoring activity and an ecological
   restoration plan which could improve the resilience of a protected
   coastal zone in the Pantano forest of Policoro, located on the Ionian
   coast (southern Italy). In this area, continuous phenomena of intensive
   deforestation, hydraulic reclamation actions, and fires have reduced the
   native species of particular naturalistic value, favouring the
   advancement of desertification, coastal erosion, and saltwater
   intrusion. The proposed actions are derived from a preliminary analysis
   on maps, UAV-images, climate data and from meetings with the local
   community. The operative process detailed in this article could be
   applied to other protected areas which are subjected to the same
   phenomena and problems.},

Title = {Vulnerability assessment of the coastal mangrove ecosystems in Guangxi,
   China, to sea-level rise},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {265-275},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise caused by global climate change will have significant
   impacts on the coastal zone. On tropical and subtropical coasts,
   mangrove ecosystems occur in the intertidal zone and are particularly
   sensitive to sea-level rise. Taking the mangrove ecosystems in the
   coastal zone of Guangxi province, China, as a case study, the potential
   impacts of sea-level rise were analyzed by adopting the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability
   definition. An indicator system for vulnerability assessment on coastal
   mangroves undergoing sea-level rise was developed, in which the rate of
   sea-level rise, subsidence/uplift rate, habitat elevation, mean daily
   inundation duration, intertidal slope and sedimentation rate were
   selected as the key indicators. A spatial assessment method based on a
   geographic information systems platform was established by quantifying
   each indicator, calculating the vulnerability index and grading the
   vulnerability. Vulnerability assessment, based on the projection of
   sea-level rise rates from the present trend and IPCC's A1FI scenario,
   was performed for three time periods: short term (2030s), medium term
   (2050s) and long term (2100s). The results showed that, using the
   present SLR rate of 0.29 cm/year, the mangrove ecosystems in the coastal
   zone of Guangxi would be affected only in the long-term scenario up to
   2100, but not in the short-term or medium-term scenarios. In the
   long-term scenario of the present trend, 5.4 \% of the mangroves would
   be within areas of low vulnerability. Under the A1FI climate change
   scenario, with a sea-level rise rate of 0.59 cm/year, 25.8 and 37.3 \%
   of mangroves were within areas of low vulnerability in the scenarios of
   up to 2030s and the 2050s, while 23.9 and 13.4 \% of mangroves were
   within areas of low and moderate vulnerability in the 2100s,
   respectively. The development of this new methodology for vulnerability
   assessment and the results presented in this study could assist with the
   objective and quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of mangrove
   ecosystems undergoing the impacts of sea-level rise elsewhere. Without
   proper mitigation options, the potential decrease and loss of mangrove
   habitats and ecosystem services from the Guangxi coast are inevitable.
   Based on the results of this study, mitigation measures should be
   considered for securing the future of these mangrove ecosystems, which
   include the management of sedimentation, control of reclamation, and
   methods for habitat rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {The adaptive strategy of Tetraselmis indica to survive darkness was
   evaluated over a period of 182 days. Resting cells formation and
   reduction in catabolic activity facilitated dark survival and their
   rejuvenation. The occurrence of thick-walled cells (type 1) and
   thin-walled cells with the condensed chloroplast (type 2) in light-dark
   and dark conditions respectively indicated differential resting cell
   formation. The dissolved organic carbon remained nearly constant
   throughout the dark period signifying T. indica did not favour
   heterotrophy. Upon re-illumination of dark-adapted cells, the lag phase
   lengthened from 2 to 28 days when darkness period increased from 8 to
   182 days, respectively. However, this negative influence on growth was
   compensated by an increase in growth rate from 0.35 to 0.95 d(-1). This
   resurgence capability of T. indica after six months of dark exposure and
   distinctive resting cell formation indicate a differential population
   sustenance mechanism. Further elucidation of dark adaptability and
   survival strategies in T. indica may have significance in ecological and
   evolutionary processes.},

Title = {Determinants of household fuelwood collection from mangrove plantations
   in coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {83-92},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Government of Bangladesh has been establishing mangrove plantations
   since 1960. This study analyzes results from a household survey across
   eight coastal villages to investigate how local rural communities
   utilize these resources. The predominant direct use by households is the
   extraction of combustible fuel. Econometric results suggest that
   determinants of the household decision to collect fuelwood include
   respondent occupation and village. Farmers are less likely to extract
   mangrove fuels due to the availability of substitutes such as
   agricultural residues, and are also less likely obtain non-mangrove
   fuelwood via market purchase. Collection quantities are positively
   correlated with degree of impoverishment, with poorer households
   significantly less likely to access non-mangrove fuelwood markets. These
   results are robust to selection bias, spatial lag dependence, and
   spatial error dependence, and have important policy implications for
   beneficiary selection for future mangrove plantations.},

Title = {Adaptive measures for mitigating urban heat islands: The potential of
   thermochromic materials to control roofing energy balance},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {247},
Pages = {155-170},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, the urgent need for reducing building energy
   consumption has prompted the scientific community to investigate and
   develop new adaptive materials for the built environment, and to use
   field monitoring and multiscale advanced modeling for analyzing and
   improving the urban microclimate conditions using these new materials.
   In this work, the Princeton Urban Canopy Model (PUCM) is used to
   investigate the potential of an advanced urban roofing material to
   counteract urban overheating in summer, while simultaneously taking
   advantage of solar passive heating in winter. The roofing applications
   are characterized by an adaptive dynamic temperature-dependent optical
   behavior. In particular, the effect of thermochromic materials on local
   energy transport phenomena is assessed and benchmarked against a
   traditional dark roof and a more common cool roof solution. These
   materials undergo a rapid albedo increase when the surface temperature
   exceeds a certain threshold. Results demonstrate that using
   thermochromic materials produces a smart optical response to local
   environmental stimuli and allows enhanced shortwave solar reflection in
   summer conditions, reduced reflected solar fraction in winter, and
   adaptive properties during transition periods.},

Title = {Projecting future distributions of ecosystem climate niches:
   Uncertainties and management applications},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {279},
Pages = {128-140},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches
   has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change.
   However, variability in such projections for the future periods,
   particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates,
   remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into
   climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust
   statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach
   consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios,
   and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random
   Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990),
   described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major
   ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted
   current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate =
   4-16\% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the
   distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009)
   and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We
   found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for
   BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23\% of BC since the 1970s.
   Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated
   climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental
   cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for
   coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for
   boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially.
   Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of
   Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii {[}Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems,
   we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this
   frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting
   managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed
   orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The
   results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate
   envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for
   incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning.
   It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource
   management to a changing climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Behavioural responses of invasive American mink Neovison vison to an
   eradication campaign, revealed by stable isotope analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. The detrimental impacts of invasive, non-native species on islands
   are widely acknowledged and it is often best to act rapidly against such
   species, even where uncertainty exists over the best way to proceed. If
   management actions are evaluated and refined, using information learnt
   from the biology of culled animals, this uncertainty can be gradually
   reduced, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome.
   2. American mink Neovison vison carcasses were collected as part of an
   eradication campaign on several islands of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland,
   and stable isotope analysis was used to describe ecological variation in
   this invasive non-native predator.
   3. Isotope profiles from individual mink whiskers demonstrated how
   behaviour at a population level changed markedly over time. As the
   eradication campaign progressed, mink increased their reliance on marine
   food sources and focused their activity on the coastline. Stable isotope
   analyses also demonstrated sex-related changes in foraging and ranging
   behaviour in relation to food resource availability on the two main
   island complexes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings contribute to the refinement
   of a campaign to extend the successful eradication of mink from Uist and
   Harris, to the whole of the Outer Hebrides archipelago, UK. They also
   highlight the potential for stable isotope approaches to provide more
   detailed postmortem information that can inform adaptive management of
   wildlife populations for conservation objectives.},

Number = {11},
Pages = {2275-2299},

Abstract = {The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has been criticized for
   inaccurate flood hazard maps and premiums that are not risk based. We
   employ granular storm surge data comprised of five different event
   probabilities with associated flood elevations to calculate surge
   risk-based premiums for homes in Pensacola, Florida, which we compare
   with NFIP premiums that are based on flood risk data with only one event
   probability (1\% annual chance floods). We demonstrate how more granular
   flood risk data used for calculating risk-based insurance premiums
   should be part of the NFIP mapping and rate-setting processes. We then
   examine three different sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios specific to
   Pensacola from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA), and assess surge risk-based premiums out to 2100. We analyze the
   cost effectiveness of elevating homes to mitigate surge risks when costs
   of elevation are one lump upfront sum, and when costs are spread over 30
   years via low-interest mitigation loans. Benefits are the avoided future
   losses from surge risks going out to 2100 with the three different SLR
   scenarios. Findings show that it is cost effective to elevate high-value
   homes with low first-floor elevations in the most risky surge zones.
   Spreading costs of elevation with 30-year loans should be directed at
   low-income households to address affordability concerns. Alternative
   flood mitigation actions, such as wet floodproofing and elevating
   electrical and plumbing utilities, should be considered in instances
   where elevation is not cost effective.},

   released natu-rally or through human activities. For the first time, a
   systematic global assessment of geothermal arsenic (As) in fluids of the
   six principal types of geothermal reservoirs and their environmental
   impact (e.g. freshwater sources used for drinking and irrigation),
   distinguishing between different uses (if any), was performed based on
   research of the geo -chemical characteristics and geotectonic setting of
   the formation of natural geothermal reservoirs worldwide. This will
   assist to further improve the sustainability of geothermal energy use,
   which can be an excellent environmental friendly renewable energy
   resource for electric power production and direct heat use. Arsenic in
   geothermal fluids (up to several tens of mg/L) originates especially in
   deep seated (several kilometers) reservoirs. Proper management of
   geothermal fluids during exploration, exploitation, use and disposal of
   resulting waste products through sustainable As mitigation strategies
   are essential. However, more research about As speciation and volatile
   As is necessary to fulfil this aim. Therefore As (and its principal
   species) needs to be included as parameter for standard analysis and
   monitor -ing program in any project using geothermal fluids from
   exploration to management of resulting wastes as base to de -fine
   appropriate mitigation actions.},

Title = {Implementation challenges of climate change adaptation initiatives in
   coastal lagoon communities in the Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {MARITIME STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {This paper explores some key challenges the Mexican government may face
   when implementing climate change adaptation initiatives in coastal
   lagoon communities in the Mexican state of Tabasco, in the Gulf of
   Mexico. I discuss some challenges state initiatives of this type may
   encounter considering the existence of local contentious political
   issues among various actors -fishers and the state-owned oil industry
   -that are at the core of the emergence of coastal environmental changes
   in the study site. A close analysis of local political, economic and
   environmental processes in coastal lagoon communities illustrates the
   existence of contentious issues among powerful actors over territory and
   its resources. It is in the context of these local, on the ground,
   issues that I argue that climate change adaptation interventions become
   highly political. I also argue that climate change policy analysis must
   be done in light of past and failed state interventions in Tabasco that
   have had a negative impact on ecosystems and fishers' livelihoods. My
   analysis of climate change adaptation initiatives and fishers' views on
   their local environmental problems is based on political ecology
   approaches to environmental narratives and critical literature on
   climate change.},

Title = {Perceptions of Risk among Households in Two Australian Coastal
   Communities},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-159},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There is limited knowledge of risk perceptions in coastal communities
   despite their vulnerability to a range of risks including the impacts of
   climate change. A survey of 400 households in two Australian coastal
   communities, combined with semi-structured interviews, provides insight
   into household perceptions of the relative importance of climatic and
   non-climatic risks and the subsequent risk priorities that may inform
   household adaptive action. In contrast to previous research, the results
   demonstrated that geographic location and household characteristics
   might not affect perceptions of vulnerability to environmental hazards.
   However, past experience was a significant influence, raising the
   priority of environmental concerns. Overall, the results highlight the
   priority concerns of coastal households (from finance, to health and
   environment) and suggest to increase the profile of climate issues in
   coastal communities climate change strategies need to better demonstrate
   links between climate vulnerability and other household concerns.
   Furthermore, promoting generic capacities in isolation from
   understanding the context in which households construe climate risks is
   unlikely to yield the changes required to decrease the vulnerability of
   coastal communities.},

Title = {Simulation-Based Exceedance Probability Curves to Assess the Economic
   Impact of Storm Surge Inundations due to Climate Change: A Case Study in
   Ise Bay, Japan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Understanding storm surge inundation risk is essential for developing
   countermeasures and adaptation strategies for tackling climate change.
   Consistent assessment of storm surge inundation risk that links
   probability of hazard occurrence to distribution of economic consequence
   are scarce due to the lack of historical data and uncertainty of climate
   change, especially at local scales. This paper proposes a
   simulation-based method to construct exceedance probability (EP) curves
   for representing storm surge risk and identifying the economic impact of
   climate change in the coastal areas of Ise Bay, Japan. The
   region-specific exceedance probability curves show that risk could be
   different among different districts. The industry-specific exceedance
   probability curves show that manufacturing, transport and postal
   activities, electricity, gas, heat supply and water, and wholesale and
   retail trade are the most affected sectors in terms of property damage.
   Services also need to be of concern in terms of business interruption
   loss. Exceedance probability curves provide complete risk information
   and our simulation-based approach can contribute to a better
   understanding of storm surge risk, improve the quantitative assessment
   of the climate change-driven impacts on coastal areas, and identify
   vulnerable regions and industrial sectors in detail.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {369-386},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Globally sustainable environmental practices in ports have been linked
   to socio-economic benefits. While African ports are increasingly
   acknowledging environmental issues and starting to address these in
   environmental policy, many are still struggling with effective
   implementation of sound environmental management practices. Multiple
   factors have been identified as potentially contributing to these
   challenges including institutional limitations, financial constraints,
   and limited human and technical capacity. In this paper, we propose an
   EMS framework for African ports, based on international best practice,
   but customised to specific continental challenges, and taking guidance
   from integrated coastal management (ICM) best practice recognising that
   coastal systems are the broader domain within which ports are spatially
   situated. The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) model provides the adaptive
   management structure for the proposed EMS framework. We consider this
   framework as a logical and structured method to initiate the
   implementation of EMS in African ports more effectively, compatible with
   international standards such as ISO 14001. Unpacking each of the key
   components and elements within the PDCA model, together with motivation
   for their inclusion, provides greater transparency to port managers who
   ultimately have to understand and implement EMS processes.},

Abstract = {The combined model produced a tool for evaluating effects on fish
   populations from passage through hydro-power turbines at dams. Mean
   blade-strike mortality was higher for adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar) and sea-run brown trout (Salmo trutta) (25.2\%-45.3\%) than for
   juveniles (5.3\%-9.7\%). Based on life cycle modeling, salmon
   populations in two Swedish rivers responded differently to strategies
   for mitigating mortality caused by fish striking turbine blades.
   Although population growth rates increased up to 3\% and were relatively
   similar for both rivers. the relative increase in the number of female
   salmon escaping above a dam annually after 20 years when both juveniles
   and adults were protected was greater in the River Pitealven (68\%) than
   in the River Vindelalven (46\%) and was approximately four times greater
   in the River Pitealven (38\% vs. 10\%) when only adults were protected.
   These population responses were not predicted by estimates of mortality
   through turbines. They showed the model could be used to evaluate
   strategies to conserve fish populations affected by dams located in fish
   migratory corridors and how postspawn adults contributed to population
   productivity.},

Title = {Lessons From the Pacific Islands - Adapting to Climate Change by
   Supporting Social and Ecological Resilience},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {By necessity, Pacific Islands have become hubs of innovation, where
   climate strategies are piloted and refined to inform adaptation efforts
   globally. Pacific Island ecosystems are being degraded by pollution,
   overfishing, and unsustainable development. They also increasingly face
   severe climate impacts including sea-level rise, changing temperature
   and rainfall patterns. These impacts result inchanges in food and water
   security, loss of identity, climate-induced migration and threats to
   sovereignty. In response, communities in the region are leading climate
   adaptation strategies, often combining traditional practices and
   cutting-edge science, to build the resilience of their communities and
   ecosystems in the face of increasing climate risk. For example,
   communities are implementing resilient networks of marine protected
   areas using the best available science and strengthening tribal
   governance to manage these networks, experimenting with salt and drought
   tolerant crops, revegetating coastlines with native salt-tolerant
   plants, revitalizing traditional wells, and implementing climate-smart
   development plans. Often these efforts contribute to local development
   priorities and create co-benefits for multiple sustainable development
   goals (SDGs). These community efforts are being scaled up through
   provincial and national policies that reinforce the critical role that
   ecosystems play in climate adaptation and provide a model for the rest
   of the world. While adaptation efforts are critical to help communities
   cope with climate impacts, in some cases, they will be insufficient to
   address the magnitude of climate impacts and local development needs.
   Thus, there are inherent trade-offs and limitations to climate
   adaptation with migration being the last resort for some island
   communities.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea is particularly vulnerable to warming and the
   abrupt declines experienced by the endemic Posidonia oceanica
   populations after recent heatwaves have forecasted severe consequences
   for the ecological functions and socio-economical services this habitat
   forming species provides. Nevertheless, this highly clonal and
   long-lived species could be more resilient to warming than commonly
   thought since heat-sensitive plants massively bloomed after a simulated
   heatwave, which provides the species with an opportunity to adapt to
   climate change. Taking advantage of this unexpected plant response, we
   investigated for the first time the molecular and physiological
   mechanisms involved in seagrass flowering through the transcriptomic
   analysis of bloomed plants. We also aimed to identify if flowering is a
   stress-induced response as suggested from the fact that heat-sensitive
   but not heat-tolerant plants flowered. The transcriptomic profiles of
   flowered plants showed a strong metabolic activation of sugars and
   hormones and indications of an active transport of these solutes within
   the plant, most likely to induce flower initiation in the apical
   meristem. Preflowered plants also activated numerous epigenetic-related
   genes commonly used by plants to regulate the expression of key floral
   genes and stress-tolerance genes, which could be interpreted as a
   mechanism to survive and optimize reproductive success under stress
   conditions. Furthermore, these plants provided numerous molecular clues
   suggesting that the factor responsible for the massive flowering of
   plants from cold environments (heat-sensitive) can be considered as a
   stress. Heat-stress induced flowering may thus be regarded as an
   ultimate response to survive extreme warming events with potential
   adaptive consequences for the species. Fitness implications of this
   unexpected stress-response and the potential consequences on the
   phenotypic plasticity (acclimation) and evolutionary (adaptation)
   opportunity of the species to ocean warming are finally discussed.},

Title = {Optimal adaptive fuzzy management strategy for fuel cell-based DC
   microgrid},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {247},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {This study presents an optimal adaptive intelligent energy management
   strategy designed for a DC microgrid based on a fuel cell system (FC),
   photovoltaic array (PV), and battery bank. The main objective is to
   enhance the system's power saving. For this reason, an optimal adaptive
   FC-based energy management strategy (EMS) is designed. The optimizer
   updates the fuzzy membership functions according to the provided energy
   by the fuel cell and the main grid. The used optimizer is based on
   meta-heuristic optimization strategies such as particle swarm
   optimization (PSO); salp swarm algorithm (SSA); Archimedes optimization
   algorithm (AOA); marine predator algorithm (MPA); artificial
   ecosystem-based optimization (AEO); equilibrium optimizer (EO);
   political optimizer (PO) and tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA). Each one of
   the studied optimizers provides its proper performance depending on its
   optimization mechanism. To check the performance of both conventional
   and optimal adaptive FC based EMS, a comparative study was carried out
   utilizing Matlab Simulink. The obtained results prove the political
   optimizer's superiority (PO) over the other optimizers, where the
   obtained power saving using PO achieved 7.7\% with a tracking efficiency
   of 99.571\%. Statistical analysis using the Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   test will be performed to approve the performance of the proposed energy
   management strategy.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The practice of settling and enacting strategic guidelines for climate
   adaptation in spatial planning: lessons from ten Swedish municipalities},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1133-1143},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Spatial planning is increasingly expected to address climate change
   adaptation. In a Swedish context, this has meant a predominant focus on
   risks of flooding, erosion and sea-level rise. Gradually, regulatory
   mechanisms and concrete strategies are evolving to support practical
   mainstreaming. The aim of this paper was to analyze how frontline
   planners approach climate change adaptation in an urban context,
   emphasizing the process of settling and enacting strategic guidelines in
   spatial planning. The study suggests that municipalities are being
   preactive, i.e., preparing to act by settling guidelines rather than
   proactively implementing change when planning for new settlements.
   Further, the process of accommodating climate risks involves problems.
   Settling strategic guidelines and determining appropriate levels for
   what to adapt to are but the start of approaching climate change.
   Guidelines represent more of an endeavor than settling absolute limits
   and actually applying the guidelines involves challenges of
   accessibility and esthetics where the new waterfront limits meets older
   city structures. Further, guidelines are seen as negotiable since an
   overarching principle is to maintain flexibility in planning to allow
   for continued waterfront planning. Pursuing this path is motivated by
   current demand and previous urban settlement patterns. Also, as future
   protective measures are needed to secure existing urban areas at risk of
   flooding and erosion, planners see no use in preventing further
   waterfront development. Although settling guidelines are important in
   preparing to act, their practical effectiveness all fall back to how
   they are actually implemented in daily planning. This leads us to
   problematize the role of strategic guidelines to secure a climate-proof
   spatial planning.},

Title = {Carbon prices and CCS investment: A comparative study between the
   European Union and China},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {327-340},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage is considered as a key option for climate
   change mitigation; policy makers and investors need to know when CCS
   becomes economically attractive. Integrating CCS in a power plant adds
   significant costs which can be offset by a sufficient CO2 price.
   However, most markets have failed: currently, the weak carbon price
   threatens CCS deployment in the European Union (EU). In China, a carbon
   regulation is appearing and CCS encounters a rising interest. This study
   investigates two questions: how much is the extra-cost of a CCS plant in
   the EU in comparison with China? Second, what is the CO2 price beyond
   which CCS plants become more profitable than reference plants in the EU
   and in China? To address these issues, I conducted a literature review
   on public studies about CCS costs. To objectively assess the
   profitability of CCS plants, I constructed a net present value model to
   calculate the Levelised Cost of Electricity and the breakeven CO2 price.
   CCS plants become the most profitable plant type beyond 115 /tCO(2) in
   the Eli vs. 45 (sic)/tCO(2) in China (offshore transport and storage
   costs). I advise on the optimal plant type choice depending on the CO2
   price in both countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reduced Rainfall Variability Reduces Growth of Nothofagus alessandrii
   Espinosa (Nothofagaceae) in the Maule Region, Chile},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Nothofagus alessandrii Espinosa is an endemic species of the coastal
   Maulino forest of central Chile that has historically been severely
   threatened by the reduction of its habitat and the isolation of its
   fragments. In addition, a gradual reduction in precipitation has been
   observed in recent years across its entire natural distribution area.
   Although the genus Nothofagus has been extensively analyzed in
   dendrochronological studies in the Southern Hemisphere, the
   dendrochronological potential of this species is unknown. In this study,
   we developed a novel tree-ring chronology of N. alessandrii in order to
   examine the climate sensitivity of the radial growth and to thus
   understand its response to climate change in central Chile. Our
   ring-width chronology showed a series intercorrelation value of 0.48 for
   the period of 1942-2016 (EPS < 0.85, with 10 trees), showing a strong
   common growth signal among the trees. N. alessandrii growth was strongly
   influenced by precipitation from May to November (the austral winter and
   spring seasons), while the temperature signal was weak. We observed that
   the radial growth patterns of N. alessandrii chronology showed upward
   growth trends, with a marked positive slope until the mid-1980s.
   However, a negative trend was observed for the period of 1985-2016,
   which was related to the increased drought conditions (rainfall and soil
   moisture reductions) in past decades and affected the entire natural
   distribution of the species. We suggest that drier winters and springs
   would slow the growth of this species. This information is of vital
   importance to understanding the growth dynamics of N. alessandrii, a
   critically endangered species, and to take on urgent adaptation and
   mitigation measures in the face of climate change.},

Title = {Climate-change-induced range shifts of three allergenic ragweeds
   (Ambrosia L.) in Europe and their potential impact on human health},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Invasive allergenic plant species may have severe health-related
   impacts. In this study we aim to predict the effects of climate change
   on the distribution of three allergenic ragweed species (A mbrosia spp.)
   in Europe and discuss the potential associated health impact. We built
   species distribution models based on presence-only data for three
   ragweed species, using MAXENT software. Future climatic habitat
   suitability was modeled under two IPCC climate change scenarios (RCP 6.0
   and RCP 8.5). We quantify the extent of the increase in `high allergy
   risk' (HAR) areas, i.e., parts of Europe with climatic conditions
   corresponding to the highest quartile (25\%) of present day habitat
   suitability for each of the three species. We estimate that by year
   2100, the distribution range of all three ragweed species increases
   towards Northern and Eastern Europe under all climate scenarios. HAR
   areas will expand in Europe by 27-100\%, depending on species and
   climate scenario. Novel HAR areas will occur mostly in Denmark, France,
   Germany, Russia and the Baltic countries, and overlap with densely
   populated cities such as Paris and St. Petersburg. We conclude that
   areas in Europe affected by severe ragweed associated allergy problems
   are likely to increase substantially by year 2100, affecting millions of
   people. To avoid this, management strategies must be developed that
   restrict ragweed dispersal and establishment of new populations.
   Precautionary efforts should limit the spread of ragweed seeds and
   reduce existing populations. Only by applying cross-countries management
   plans can managers mitigate future health risks and economical
   consequences of a ragweed expansion in Europe.},

Title = {Where Are White Roofs More Effective in Cooling the Surface?},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {By reflecting more sunlight, white (cool) roofs experience lower surface
   temperatures and produce less heating of the surrounding air. The
   effectiveness of cool roofs, quantified by the surface temperature
   difference between cool and regular roofs (Delta T-s), is known to vary
   spatially. A common perception is that Delta T-s is controlled by solar
   radiation that reaches the roof surface. Here we use an Earth System
   Model and a surface energy balance model to show that the spatial
   variability of Delta T-s, when normalized by the albedo difference
   between cool and regular roofs Delta alpha, is also controlled by an
   energy distribution factor that encodes the efficiencies of surface
   energy balance components in dissipating heat. Our results suggest that
   painting the roof white is more effective when the roof has less
   water-holding capacity and smaller thermal admittance and is located in
   places with more solar radiation, less precipitation, and lower wind
   speed.
   Plain Language Summary Solar reflective roofs (also called white or cool
   roofs) are a common heat mitigation strategy. By increasing the albedo
   of roof surface, more sunlight is reflected, leading to less heating of
   the building and the surrounding air. In this study, the effectiveness
   of cool roofs is represented by the reduction of roof surface
   temperature per unit increase of roof albedo. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that this effectiveness varies spatially, but the
   controlling factors of the spatial variability remain unquantified. We
   find that the cool roof effectiveness is mainly controlled by the solar
   radiation that reaches the roof surface and an energy distribution
   factor that encodes efficiencies of different surface energy components
   in dissipating heat. Our results suggest that painting the roof white is
   more effective when the roof is located in places with more solar
   radiation, lower wind speed, less precipitation, and when the roof has
   less water-holding capacity and smaller thermal admittance. These
   findings shed new insights into how we implement heat mitigation
   strategies in urban environments. We stress that our study only focuses
   on the surface temperature, acknowledging that the impacts of cool roofs
   on air temperature and building energy consumption require further
   investigations.},

Abstract = {This paper describes several cases that explore the impacts of potential
   emergent conditions, including climate change and other factors, to
   infrastructure systems and mission assurance. The cases suggest a need
   to account in strategic planning for combinations of emergent
   conditions, including climate, economic, technological, social, and
   political conditions. We define scenarios to be specific combinations of
   diverse emergent conditions. We discuss the implications of emergent
   conditions for multicriteria analysis of strategic investments. The
   identification of influential emergent conditions can focus
   investigative and modeling efforts on issues of concern for long time
   horizons. The several cases are: (i) inland training ranges in Alaska,
   (ii) communities of Alaska vulnerable to coastal erosion, and (iii)
   energy security of military installations. The approach is generalizable
   to highlight the combinations of emergent conditions that should be
   influential to adaptation and strategic planning for inland and
   terrestrial infrastructure systems.},

Title = {Citizen science for monitoring seasonal-scale beach erosion and

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Sandy beaches are highly dynamic systems which provide natural
   protection from the impact of waves to coastal communities. With coastal
   erosion hazards predicted to increase globally, data to inform decision
   making on erosion mitigation and adaptation strategies is becoming
   critical. However, multi-temporal topographic data over wide
   geographical areas is expensive and time consuming and often requires
   highly trained professionals. In this study we demonstrate a novel
   approach combining citizen science with low-cost unmanned aerial
   vehicles that reliably produces survey-grade morphological data able to
   model sediment dynamics from event to annual scales. The high-energy
   wave-dominated coast of south-eastern Australia, in Victoria, is used as
   a field laboratory to test the reliability of our protocol and develop a
   set of indices to study multi-scale erosional dynamics. We found that
   citizen scientists provide unbiased data as accurate as professional
   researchers. We then observed that open-ocean beaches mobilise three
   times as much sediment as embayed beaches and distinguished between
   slowed and accelerated erosional modes. The data was also able to assess
   the efficiency of sand nourishment for shore protection. Our citizen
   science protocol provides high quality monitoring capabilities, which
   although subject to important legislative preconditions, it is
   applicable in other parts of the world and transferable to other
   landscape systems where the understanding of sediment dynamics is
   critical for management of natural or anthropogenic processes.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {238-246},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) remain central to the conservation of
   marine biodiversity, but enhancing their resilience under climate change
   require that organizations managing them are able to adapt. Social
   factors like institutions can affect organizational capacities to adapt
   to climate change. Yet our knowledge about how different institutional
   designs for protected areas affect management adaptive capacity is
   limited. We address this gap by comparing how two models of MPA
   governance - centralized and collaborative (co-management) - influence
   the adaptive capacities of public organizations managing MPAs in East
   Africa. Social network analysis is used to examine external relations of
   MPA organizations which are interpreted through the lens of social
   capital theory to explain the acquisition of information and knowledge
   that support adaptive capacity. We find differences in the ways focal
   MPA organizations in the centralized and co-managed MPA systems are
   connected to their external partners. In the centralized system, the
   focal MPA organization operates in a less connected network rich in
   opportunities to bridge disconnected groups that can be a source of
   novel and diverse information. Conversely, the focal MPA organization in
   the co-managed system operates in a dense network of interconnected
   organizations that are likely to have similar information, therefore
   providing redundant information benefits. The composition of partners
   around focal MPA organizations which determines information quality is
   not affected by MPA governance context. We conclude that institutional
   context affects the relational dimensions of adaptive capacity, by
   giving greater or fewer opportunities for the development of either
   bridging or bonding social capital.},

   have emerged during the past decade and develop a predictive framework
   that integrates knowledge from ecophysiology and community ecology with
   modeling approaches. Future work must continue to anticipate and monitor

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {This study provides an overview of 11 lagoons in North Africa, from the
   Atlantic to the Eastern Mediterranean. Lagoons are complex,
   transitional, coastal zones providing valuable ecosystem services that
   contribute to the welfare of the human population. The main economic
   sectors in the lagoons included fishing, shellfish harvesting, and salt
   and sand extraction, as well as maritime transport. Economic sectors in
   the areas around the lagoons and in the watershed included agriculture,
   tourism, recreation, industrial, and urban development. Changes were
   also identified in land use from reclamation, changes in hydrology,
   changes in sedimentology from damming, inlet modifications, and coastal
   engineering. The human activities in and around the lagoons exert
   multiple pressures on these ecosystems and result in changes in the
   environment, affecting salinity, dissolved oxygen, and erosion; changes
   in the ecology, such as loss of biodiversity; and changes in the
   delivery of valuable ecosystem services. Loss of ecosystem services such
   as coastal protection and seafood affect human populations that live
   around the lagoons and depend on them for their livelihood. Adaptive
   management frameworks for social-ecological systems provide options that
   support decision makers with science-based knowledge to deliver
   sustainable development for ecosystems. The framework used to support
   the decision makers for environmental management of these 11 lagoons is
   Drivers-Activities-Pressures-State Change-Impact (on Welfare)-Responses
   (as Measures).},

Abstract = {Coastal hazards are an urgent issue of global concern considering the
   increasing population pressure in coastal regions, retreating
   coastlines, and rising seawater levels. Here we demonstrate the process
   of assessing the vulnerability of a coastal urban environment using the
   case of Kuala Terengganu, a coastal town in Malaysia, and evaluating the
   potential social, environmental, and economic impacts. Uncertainties in
   the human dimensions of global change deeply affect the assessment and
   responses to environmental, climatic, and non-climate impacts on coastal
   city population growth and communities. We address these uncertainties
   by combining a Delphi-Analytical Hierarchy Process (Delphi-AHP) model
   and Geographic Information System (GIS)tools to determine mitigation and
   adaptation probabilities as part of a Coastal City Vulnerability
   Assessment. We conclude by presenting calculations of the short- and
   long-term suitability for land use and recommending hazard mitigation
   measures to equip city planners and decision-makers in evaluating
   hazards and potential impacts on coastal city areas.},

Title = {Developing the capacity to monitor climate change impacts in
   Mediterranean estuaries},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Pages = {529-550},
Abstract = {Background: Under predicted climate change scenarios, estuaries and
   deltas face increased threats to biological sustainability. The
   Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA forms the upstream
   component of the largest estuary on the Pacific coast of the Americas.
   It is a Mediterranean system in steep ecological decline under threat
   from current and potential climate changes.
   Goal: Illustrate how climate change impacts on an already fragile system
   can be monitored with new, advanced remote sensing methods. Describe how
   remote sensing data can improve monitoring of ecosystem changes. Use
   examples from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California to
   illustrate some of the types of ecosystem changes that are expected with
   climate change, such as changing species composition and dominance,
   changes in environmental conditions like salinity, water and air
   temperatures, and precipitation patterns. Show how imaging spectroscopy
   can provide information about the dynamics of native and invasive
   estuarine plant communities.
   Data: Airborne HyMap imaging spectroscopy data of the Sacramento-San
   Joaquin Delta collected in June for the years 2004 through 2008.
   Approximately 65 flightlines covered the Delta each year with 3 x 3 m
   spatial resolution. Concurrent field data recorded geographical
   locations and phenology of different aquatic plant species. Airborne
   LiDAR data rasterized at 1 x 1 m, collected in winter 2007 for the
   entire Delta, was used to calculate light interception by riparian tree
   canopies.
   Analysis method: We used hyperspectral image analysis in various
   classification algorithms to perform vegetation type and species
   mapping, and estimate plant densities and functional traits. A radiative
   transfer model was applied to LiDAR data to estimate the effects of
   riparian tree canopies on the irradiance budget of the surface waters of
   the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as a surrogate for potential water
   temperature increases.
   Results: New remote sensing techniques and data detected and measured
   the density and other functional traits of plant communities and species
   in this delta. Examining the year-to-year locations of pixels containing
   invasive species shows that they have high rates of persistence, and
   that the predicted increases in water temperature may improve the
   habitat conditions for invasive aquatic plant species. Other changes,
   such as altered precipitation patterns, may affect the hydrograph of the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and its turbidity that could further
   improve the habitat for non-native species, although sea level rise and
   increasing upstream salinity might produce the opposite effect.
   Conclusions: The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Estuary face ecosystem
   problems that are characteristic of most Mediterranean estuaries.
   Interactions between the biological and physical conditions in the Delta
   affect the trajectory of dominance by native and invasive aquatic plant
   species. Trends in growth and community characteristics associated with
   predicted impacts of climate change (sea level rise, warmer
   temperatures, changes in the hydrograph with high winter and low summer
   outflows) do not provide simple predictions. Individually, the impact of
   specific environmental changes on the biological components can be
   predicted, however it is the complex interactions of biological
   communities with the suite of physical changes that make predictions
   uncertain. Systematic monitoring of these estuarine environments is
   critical to achieving sustainable management of these ecosystems and
   providing the data needed to document and understand change and to
   identify successful adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Here, we synthesize conceptual frameworks, applied modeling approaches,
   and as case studies to highlight complex social-ecological system (SES)
   dynamics that inform environmental policy, conservation and management.
   Although a set of ``good practices{''} about what constitutes a good SES
   study are emerging, there is still a disconnection between generating
   SES scientific studies and providing decisionrelevant information to
   policy makers. Classical single variable/hypothesis studies rooted in
   one or two disciplines are still most common, leading to incremental
   growth in knowledge about the natural or social system, but rarely both.
   The recognition of human dimensions is a key aspect of successful
   planning and implementation in natural resource management,
   ecosystem-based management, fisheries management, and marine
   conservation. The lack of social data relating to human-nature
   interactions in this particular context is now seen as an omission,
   which can often erode the efficacy of any resource management or
   conservation action. There have been repeated calls for a
   transdisciplinary approach to complex SESs that incorporates resilience,
   complexity science characterized by intricate feedback interactions,
   emergent processes, non-linear dynamics and uncertainty. To achieve this
   vision, we need to embrace diverse research methodologies that
   incorporate ecology, sociology, anthropology, political science,
   economics and other disciplines that are anchored in empirical data. We
   conclude that to make SES research most useful in adding practical value
   to conservation planning, marine resource management planning processes
   and implementation, and the integration of resilience thinking into
   adaptation strategies, more research is needed on (1) understanding
   social-ecological landscapes and seascapes and patterns that would
   ensure planning process legitimacy, (2) costs of transformation
   (financial, social, environmental) to a stable resilient
   social-ecological system, (3) overcoming place-based data collection
   challenges as well as modeling challenges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {An optimal stochastic energy management system for resilient microgrids},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {300},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming
   model for the optimal energy management system of unbalanced three-phase
   of alternating current microgrids. The proposed model considers the
   following random variables: nodal demands, nodal renewable generation
   and voltage reference at the point of common coupling. Furthermore, the
   proposed model is aimed at providing resilient energy management system
   solutions via contingency constraints. The proposed mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear
   programming model through a set of linearizations that can be solved via
   off-the-shelf convex programming solvers. The analyzed microgrid
   comprises photovoltaic generation, energy storage systems, electric
   vehicle chargers, direct load control, and non-renewable generation,
   which operates when the microgrid is in islanded mode. The stochastic
   nature of the problem is considered through a scenario-based approach.
   The solution to the model determines the day-ahead operation of the
   microgrid resources that minimizes the average operational cost. An
   unexpected islanded operation at any given time is considered via
   contingency constraints. Tests are performed using data of the real
   microgrid at the Laboratory of Intelligent Electrical Networks (LabREI),
   at University of Campinas. Results show that the proposed model produces
   resilient day-ahead energy management system solutions while minimizing
   the average operational costs and maximizing the use of local renewable
   energy sources.},

Title = {Evaluation of fire severity in fire prone-ecosystems of Spain under two
   different environmental conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {271},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Severe fires associated to climate change and land cover changes are
   becoming more frequent in Mediterranean Europe. The influence of
   environmental drivers on fire severity, especially under different
   environmental conditions is still not fully understood. In this study we
   aim to determine the main environmental variables that control fire
   severity in large fires (>500 ha) occurring in fire-prone ecosystems
   under two different environmental conditions following a transition
   (Mediterranean-Oceanic)-Mediterranean climatic gradient within the
   Iberian Peninsula, and to provide management recommendations to mitigate
   fire damage. We estimated fire severity as the differenced Normalized
   Burn Ratio, through images obtained from Landsat 8 OLI. We also examined
   the relative influence of pre-fire vegetation structure (vegetation
   composition and configuration), prefire weather conditions, fire history
   and topography on fire severity using Random Forest machine learning
   algorithms. The results indicated that the severity of fires occurring
   along the transition (MediterraneanOceanic)-Mediterranean climatic
   gradient was primarily controlled by pre-fire vegetation composition.
   Nevertheless, the effect of vegetation composition was strongly
   dependent on interactions with fire recurrence and prefire vegetation
   structural configuration. The relationship between fire severity,
   weather and topographic predictors was not consistent among fires
   occurring in the Mediterranean-Oceanic transition and Mediterranean
   sites. In the Mediterranean-Oceanic transition site, fire severity was
   determined by weather conditions (i.e., summer cumulative rainfall),
   rather than being associated to topography, suggesting that the control
   exerted by topography may be overwhelmed by weather controls.
   Conversely, results showed that topography only had a major effect on
   fire severity in the Mediterranean site. The results of this study
   highlight the need to prioritise fuel treatments aiming at breaking fuel
   continuity and reducing fuel loads as an effective management strategy
   to mitigate fire damage in areas of high fire recurrence.},

Abstract = {Climate change is modifying scientific attitudes toward pre- and
   post-event assessments of natural hazards. Unprecedented levels of
   destruction need renewed focus on addressing and protecting communities
   forcing the decision makers to change their attention to vulnerability
   and risk assessment. In particular, society and economy rely heavily on
   infrastructures, as fundamental links for movement of goods and people,
   and are extremely vulnerable to multiple hazards (such as droughts,
   floods, storms, and coastal hazards). In this regard, resilience
   quantifies the recovery time and procedures to facilitate and enhance
   pre-hazard and post-hazard event mitigation and emergency response
   strategies of systems and entire communities. Resilience calculation
   depends on two important contributions: loss and recovery models that
   need to consider the effects of climate change. This paper aims to
   propose a methodology that implements the most recent approaches to
   assess climate change inside the traditional framework of resilience.
   The proposed framework is then applied to a case study of a bridge.},

Title = {Modelling and quantifying tomorrow's risks from natural hazards},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {817},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Understanding and modelling future risks from natural hazards is
   becoming increasingly crucial as the climate changes, human population
   grows, asset wealth accumulates, and societies become more urbanised and
   interconnected. This need is recognised by the 2015-2030 Sendai
   Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which emphasises the importance
   of preparing for the disasters that our world may face tomorrow through
   strategies/policies that aim to minimise uncontrolled development in
   hazardous areas. While the vast majority of natural-hazard
   risk-assessment frameworks have so far focused on static impacts
   associated with current conditions and/or are influenced by historical
   context, some authors have sought to provide decision makers with
   risk-quantification approaches that can be used to cultivate a
   sustainable future. This Review documents these latter efforts,
   explicitly examining work that has modelled and quantified the
   individual components that comprise tomorrow's risk, i.e., future
   natural hazards affected by climate change, future exposure (e.g., in
   terms of population, land use, and the built environment), and the
   evolving physical vulnerabilities of the world's infrastructure. We end
   with a discussion on the challenges faced by modellers in determining
   the risks that tomorrow's world may face from natural hazards, and the
   constraints these place on the decision-making abilities of relevant
   stakeholders.},

   Restoration in Prey Lang Forest},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate Change policies are playing an ever-increasing role in global
   development strategies and their implementation gives rise to
   often-unforeseen social conflicts and environmental degradations. A
   landscape approach to analyzing forest-based Climate Change Mitigation
   policies (CCM) and land grabs in the Prey Lang Forest landscape,
   Cambodia revealed two Korea-Cambodia partnership projects designed to
   increase forest cover that are juxtaposed in this paper. Case study data
   revealed a REDD+ project with little negative impact or social conflict
   in the project area and an Afforestation/Reforestation (A/R) project
   that created both social and ecological conflicts. The study concludes
   that forest-based CCM policies can reduce conflict through efforts at
   minimal transformation of local livelihoods, maximal attention to the
   tenure rights, responsibilities, and authority of citizens, and by
   improving, not degrading, the project landscapes. The paper presents the
   circumstances under which these guidelines are sidestepped by the A/R
   project, and importantly reveals that dramatic forest and livelihood
   transformation had already affected the community and environment in the
   REDD+ project site. There are deep contradictions at the heart of
   climate change policies toward which attention must be given, lest we
   leave our future generations with nothing but forest islands and
   castaway communities.},

Title = {Factors determining the gas crossover through pinholes in polymer
   electrolyte fuel cell membranes},
Journal = {ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {240-247},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Membrane degradation in polymer electrolyte fuel cells often results in
   pinhole formation, which does not force an immediate fuel cell shutdown,
   as the performance is still good and the gas crossover is moderate for
   low membrane defect densities. However, the gas crossover increases
   locally at defects, which may accelerate chemical polymer decomposition
   and enlarge the defect. Hence, a fundamental understanding of the gas
   crossover through small pinholes is required to deduce strategies
   mitigating fast membrane degradation. Methods are developed to implement
   pinholes (10 mu m) artificially in polymer electrolyte membranes. The
   pinhole morphology and chemical environment are characterized by X-ray
   tomographic microscopy and FTIR spectro-microscopy. The gas crossover is
   measured in situ for different fuel cell operating conditions using a
   mass spectrometry based method. In saturated environment liquid water
   can seal pinholes and eliminate the crossover. This sealing effect
   depends on the pinhole size and the pressure gradient between anode and
   cathode. Increasing temperature or humidity reduces the gas crossover.
   Hydrogen, permeating through defects, does not oxidize quantitatively at
   the cathode catalyst layer, but permeates through the gas diffusion
   layer (GDL) into the gas channel. Then, the permeability of the GDL, in
   particular its micro-porous layer, limits the gas crossover through
   pinholes significantly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study presents an assessment of the potential impacts of sea level
   rise on the New Jersey, USA coastal region. We produce two projections
   of sea level rise for the New Jersey coast over the next century and
   apply them to a digital elevation model to illustrate the extent to
   which coastal areas are susceptible to permanent inundation and episodic
   flooding due to storm events. We estimate future coastline displacement
   and its consequences based on direct inundation only, which provides a
   lower bound on total coastline displacement. The objective of this study
   is to illustrate methodologies that may prove useful to policy makers
   despite the large uncertainties inherent in analysis of local impacts of
   climate and sea level change. Our findings suggest that approximately
   1\% to 3\% of the land area of New Jersey would be permanently inundated
   over the next century and coastal storms would temporarily flood
   low-lying areas up to 20 times more frequently. Thus, absent human
   adaptation, by 2100 New Jersey would experience substantial land loss
   and alteration of the coastal zone, causing widespread impacts on
   coastal development and ecosystems. Given the results, we identify
   future research needs and suggest that an important next step would be
   for policy makers to explore potential adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Australian rainfall variability-Why is the eastern seaboard of Australia
   different to the rest of Australia and also internally inhomogeneous},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Eastern Seaboard of Australia (ESA) has been identified as being
   different to the rest of Australia in terms of rainfall patterns.
   However, rainfall patterns within the ESA itself are not well
   understood. This study identifies Australian rainfall districts that
   exhibit similar (and different) temporal variation, with the primary aim
   being to determine if the ESA can be considered a homogenous region with
   respect to rainfall. The results (a) confirm that the ESA is different
   to the rest of Australia and (b) show that the ESA is not homogenous and
   that East Coast Lows (ECLs) are linked to this inhomogeneity. For winter
   (JJA) three separate divisions within the ESA are identified and at
   least two clear divisions are identified in other seasons. ECL sub-types
   contribute to this inhomogeneity because each ECL sub-type is associated
   with different spatio-temporal rainfall patterns across the ESA. This is
   an important insight for natural resources management and emergency
   services within the heavily populated ESA because it demonstrates that
   existing climate related risks are different across the ESA. Further,
   the way climate risks change in the future is also likely to be
   inconsistent across the ESA. Future climate related risks will depend on
   how ECL behaviour (e.g., intensity, frequency, location, duration, path
   and geographical extent) changes. This reinforces the need for locally
   relevant and practically useful climate science information and

Title = {Understanding Resilience in a Vulnerable Industry: the Case of Reef
   Tourism in Australia},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Understanding the resilience of vulnerable sectors of social-ecological
   systems is critical in an era of escalating global change. The coral
   reef tourism sector is highly vulnerable not only to ecological effects
   of climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances on reefs, but
   also to shocks such as economic recession and energy price escalation.
   Commercial tourism enterprises are key players in reef tourism in
   Australia and elsewhere. However, the factors that confer resilience to
   reef-based tourism enterprises, or the reef tourism sector more broadly,
   in the face of large disturbances have not been investigated to date.
   This paper empirically examines the perceived resilience of reef tourism
   enterprises on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to large disturbances or
   shocks. Binary logistic regression analysis of two measures of
   enterprise resilience demonstrates the importance of human capital in
   strengthening enterprise resilience. Lifestyle identity, measured as the
   extent to which owners and senior managers are active in reef tourism as
   a lifestyle choice, is positively related to enterprise resilience.
   Finally, reef tourism enterprises indicate that financial and marketing
   support are the most important actions that government can take to
   support enterprises in the face of a large shock.},

Abstract = {Marine fisheries science is a broad field that is fundamentally
   concerned with sustainability across ecological, economic, and social
   dimensions. Ensuring the delivery of food, security, equity, and
   well-being while sustaining ecosystems in the face of rapid change is,
   by far, the main challenge facing marine fisheries. A tighter
   integration of modeling and empiricism is needed to confront this
   challenge. In particular, improved incorporation of empirically grounded
   and realistic representation of human behaviors into models will greatly
   enhance our ability to predict likely outcomes under alternative
   adaptive strategies. Challenges to this integration certainly exist, but
   many of these can be overcome via improved professional training that
   reduces cultural rifts between empiricists and modelers and between
   natural and social sciences, ideally ending the presumption that there
   is a divide between empiricism and modeling.},

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},

Volume = {36},
Number = {11-12},
Pages = {2113-2128},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Europe has been warming over the past 30 years. In particular all
   seasonal temperature records have been broken since 2003, which altered
   socio-economic and environmental systems. Since we expect this trend in
   both mean and extreme temperatures to continue along the twenty first
   century under enhanced radiative forcing, it is crucial to understand
   the underlying mechanisms of such climate variations to help in
   considering adaptation or mitigation strategies to reduce the impacts of
   a warmer climate. From a statistical analysis we show that the
   inter-annual variability of European seasonal temperatures can be
   reconstructed from North-Atlantic atmospheric circulation only, but not
   their recent trends and extreme seasons. Adding North-Atlantic
   sea-surface temperature (SST) as a predictor helps improving the
   reconstruction, especially in autumn and winter. Sensitivity experiments
   with the MM5 regional model over 2003-2007 suggest that the anomalous
   SST enhance European land temperatures through the upper-air advection
   of heat and water vapor, interacting with radiative fluxes over the
   continent. This mechanism is pronounced in autumn and winter, where
   estimates of SST influence as obtained from MM5 are in agreement with
   those obtained from statistical regressions. We find a lesser SST
   influence in spring and summer, where local surface and radiative
   feedbacks are the main amplifiers of recent extremes.},

Title = {Plasticity of Least Tern and Piping Plover nesting behaviors in response
   to sand temperature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Birds that nest on the ground in open areas, such as Piping Plovers
   (Charadrius melodus) and Interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum
   athalassos), are exposed to high temperatures in thermally stressful
   environments. As a result, some ground-nesting avian species have
   adapted behavioral strategies to maintain thermal regulation of eggs and
   themselves. We assessed the impact of sand temperature on shorebird
   nesting behaviors by installing video cameras and thermocouples at 52
   Least Tern and 55 Piping Plover nests on the Missouri River in North
   Dakota during the 2014-2015 breeding seasons. Daily duration and
   frequency of shading behaviors exhibited a nonlinear relationship with
   temperature; therefore, we used segmented regressions to determine at
   what threshold temperature (mean temperature = 25.7 degrees C for
   shading behavior daily frequency and mean temperature = 25.1 degrees C
   for shading behavior daily duration) shorebird adults exhibited a
   behavioral response to rising sand temperatures. Daily nest attendance
   of both species decreased with increasing sand temperatures in our
   system. Frequency and duration of daily shading behaviors were
   positively correlated with sand temperatures above the temperature
   threshold. Piping Plovers exhibited more and longer shading behaviors
   above and below the temperature thresholds (below: frequency = 10.30 +/-
   1.69 se, duration = 7.29 min +/- 2.35 se; above: frequency = 59.27 +/-
   6.87 se) compared to Least Terns (below: frequency = -1.37 +/- 1.98 se,
   duration = -0.73 min +/- 1.51 se; above: frequency = 31.32 +/- 7.29 se).
   The effects of sand temperature on avian ground-nesting behavior will be
   critical to understand in order to adapt or develop recovery plans in
   response to climate change.},

Abstract = {Lampreys worldwide face multiple anthropogenic stressors. Several
   species are `at-risk' listed, yet abundance data for most remain
   insufficient to adequately assess conservation status. Lamprey
   population declines are largely due to habitat degradation and
   fragmentation, pollution, and exploitation. Conservation priorities
   include: quantification of population trends and distribution;
   identification of Evolutionarily Significant Units; improved water
   quality and habitat; barrier removal or effective mitigation;
   ecologically-sensitive river flow management and hydropower planning;
   and mitigation of climate change impacts. There is urgent need for
   ecological and population demographics data for multiple species,
   particularly those in the Southern Hemisphere, Caspian Sea region, and
   Mexico. Irrigation and damming are already extensive, or rapidly
   expanding (e.g. Chile), while water-stressed regions (Mexico,
   California, Chile, Australia, Iberia) may be further impacted by climate
   change-induced flow alteration and increased temperatures. Barrier
   removal should benefit lampreys by increasing available habitat.
   However, fishways vary in effectiveness and are often inadequate, but
   present research opportunities encompassing ecohydraulics, biotelemetry
   and engineering. Environmental DNA permits rapid assessment of lamprey
   distribution within catchments, especially if improvements to
   distinguishing genetically similar groups are possible. Marine
   environments may play a critical role in population dynamics yet remain
   a ``black box{''} in anadromous lamprey biology. Studying juvenile
   lamprey ecology is a substantial challenge but should be a priority.
   Some examples are monitoring of parasitic feeding-phase lamprey through
   trawl surveys and fisheries bycatch, telemetry of movements, or
   examining chemical tracers of marine habitat use. Knowledge transfer
   between the sea lamprey control programme and native-lamprey biologists
   worldwide remains crucial to developing effective lamprey management.

Title = {Climate adaptation planning for cultural heritages in coastal tourism

Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Substantial climate change impacts threaten the persistence of cultural
   resources globally. The need exists for conceptualizing decision support
   tools that focus on quantifying and optimizing the managerial priorities
   to leverage historic preservation and adaptation actions that enhance
   the continuity of heritage values and sites. Informed by the Structured
   Decision Making (SDM) approach, this study advances the singular
   objective Optimal Preservation (OptiPres) Model, a decision support tool
   for climate adaptation planning of historic buildings by considering
   three tourism management objectives: (a) maximize accumulated resource
   value, (b) maximize cost-efficiency, and (c) minimize vulnerability.

Title = {On the cooling potential of urban heating mitigation technologies in a
   coastal temperate city},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We assess the impact of advanced heat-mitigation technologies in a
   coastal temperate city under heatwave conditions. For the first time
   urban-heating mitigation scenarios that refer to `cool/reflective' roofs
   and roads, `green/living' roofs and shading by replacing low urban
   vegetation with deciduous broadleaf trees are considered at the highly
   dense-populated city of Athens (Greece). Numerical simulations are
   performed for a typical seebreeze and a heatwave day with the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to an urbancanopy model.
   Highresolution data on vegetation and urban land use, derived from
   satellite image analysis, are considered. All scenarios show a cooling
   effect, with the maximum mean daytime temperature reduction in the case
   of `cool/reflective' roofs and roads. During daytime, the mean
   ambient-temperature reduction reaches up to 1 degrees C while for the
   surface-temperature up to 9.5 degrees C and 11.5 degrees C, on the
   see-breeze and heatwave day respectively. In the case of `green/living'
   roofs, the mean daytime latent-heat flux is increased (e.g. up to 140 W/
   m2 on the heatwave day) due to increased evapotranspiration while the
   surface temperature is more affected during nighttime. Both scenarios
   result in a sea-breeze attenuation of 0.5-1 m/s. The presence of
   deciduous broadleaf street trees has a minor impact on mean ambient
   temperature but an evident reduction in surface temperature. The mean
   urban-heating reduction ranges from 0.1 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C and
   from 0.3 degrees C to 1.7 degrees C during the sea breeze and heatwave
   day respectively, with the maximum reduction shown in `cool/reflective'
   roofs and roads and the minimum in `shading trees' scenarios.},

Title = {Storm-induced risk assessment: Evaluation of two tools at the regional
   and hotspot scale},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {134},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {241-253},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Coastal zones are under increasing risk as coastal hazards increase due
   to climate change and the consequences of these also increase due to
   on-going economic development. To effectively deal with this increased
   risk requires the development of validated tools to identify coastal
   areas of higher risk and to evaluate the effectiveness of disaster risk
   reduction (DRR) measures. This paper analyses the performance in the
   application of two tools which have been developed in the RISC-KIT
   project: the regional Coastal Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) and a
   hotspot early warning system coupled with a decision support system
   (EWS/DSS). The paper discusses the main achievements of the tools as
   well as improvements needed to support their further use by the coastal
   community. The CRAF, a tool to identify and rank hotspots of coastal
   risk at the regional scale, provides useful results for coastal managers
   and stakeholders. A change over time of the hotspots location and
   ranking can be analysed as a function of changes on coastal occupation
   or climate change. This tool is highly dependent on the quality of
   available information and a major constraint to its application is the
   relatively poor availability and accessibility of high-quality data,
   particularly in respect to social-economic indicators, and to lesser
   extent the physical environment. The EWS/DSS can be used as a warning
   system to predict potential impacts or to test the effectiveness of risk
   reduction measures at a given hotspot. This tool provides high
   resolution results, but needs validation against impact data, which are
   still scarce. The EWS/DSS tool can be improved by enhancing the
   vulnerability relationships and detailing the receptors in each area
   (increasing the detail, but also model simulations). The developed
   EWS/DSS can be adapted and extended to include a greater range of
   conditions (including climate change), receptors, hazards and impacts,
   enhancing disaster preparedness for effective risk reduction for further
   events or morphological conditions. Despite these concerns, the tools
   assessed in this paper proved to be valuable instruments for coastal
   management and risk reduction that can be adopted in a wide range of
   coastal areas.},

Abstract = {Madagascar contains Africa's fourth largest extent of mangroves,
   representing approximately 2\% of the global distribution. Since 1990,
   more than 20\% of Madagascar's mangrove ecosystems have been heavily
   degraded or deforested due primarily to increased harvest for charcoal
   and timber and the expansion of agriculture and aquaculture.
   Anthropogenic-driven loss is particularly prominent in the north-western
   Ambanja and Ambaro Bays (AAB). At over 24,000 ha, AAB is one of
   Madagascar's largest mangrove ecosystems, including prominent estuaries
   fed by rivers and streams originating in the country's highest mountain
   range. Similar to the national rate, AAB has experienced approximately
   20\% loss since 1990, driven primarily by over-harvesting for charcoal
   and timber. Continued loss threatens the livelihoods and wellbeing of
   thousands of residents who rely on the many goods and services provided
   by a healthy, relatively intact mangrove ecosystem. To combat this loss,
   Blue Ventures (BV), in partnership with local communities and the
   University of Antananarivo, is working to protect, restore and encourage
   the sustainable use of mangroves. BVs' Blue Forests project aims to help
   maintain and diversify local livelihoods and to sustainably manage
   mangroves and their associated biodiversity in AAB, as well as
   throughout western Madagascar. This chapter provides an overview of the
   biophysical characteristics, historic dynamics and current status of the
   AAB mangrove ecosystem, and mitigation strategies being implemented
   through BVs' Blue Forests project.},

Title = {Evaporation from (Blue-)Green Roofs: Assessing the Benefits of a Storage
   and Capillary Irrigation System Based on Measurements and Modeling},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Worldwide cities are facing increasing temperatures due to climate
   change and increasing urban density. Green roofs are promoted as a
   climate adaptation measure to lower air temperatures and improve comfort
   in urban areas, especially during intensive dry and warm spells.
   However, there is much debate on the effectiveness of this measure,
   because of a lack of fundamental knowledge about evaporation from
   different green roof systems. In this study, we investigate the water
   and energy balance of different roof types on a rooftop in Amsterdam,
   the Netherlands. Based on lysimeter measurements and modeling, we
   compared the water and energy balance of a conventional green roof with
   blue-green roofs equipped with a novel storage and capillary irrigation
   system. The roofs were covered either with Sedum or by grasses and
   herbs. Our measurements and modeling showed that conventional green roof
   systems (i.e., a Sedum cover and a few centimeters of substrate) have a
   low evaporation rate and due to a rapid decline in available moisture, a
   minor cooling effect. Roofs equipped with a storage and capillary
   irrigation system showed a remarkably large evaporation rate for Sedum
   species behaving as C3 plants during hot, dry periods. Covered with
   grasses and herbs, the evaporation rate was even larger. Precipitation
   storage and capillary irrigation strongly reduced the number of days
   with dry-out events. Implementing these systems therefore could lead to
   better cooling efficiencies in cities.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {55-61},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Assessment of fisheries vulnerability to climate change is an important
   step for enhancing the understanding and decision-making to reduce such
   vulnerability. This study aimed to provide an analysis of country level
   vulnerability focusing on food security implications of climatic
   disturbances on marine fisheries. The comparative magnitude and
   distribution of potential food security impacts of climatic disturbances
   on marine fisheries were assessed for 109 countries by scoring and
   ranking countries against a set of vulnerability criteria including
   metrics of national exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity,
   highlighting the contribution of marine fisheries to national food and
   nutrition security. Results showed that developing countries in Africa,
   Asia, Oceania, and Latin America appeared to be most vulnerable, and the
   key sources of vulnerability differed considerably among the countries.
   For countries most vulnerable to climate-induced effects on marine
   fisheries, more than two-thirds of them depended on domestic marine
   fisheries as a main source of fish supply. Developing appropriate
   adaptation policies and management plans to reduce the impacts of
   changing climate is of great importance to sustain food security in
   these highly vulnerable and heavy marine fisheries-dependent countries.},

Abstract = {The Institute of Water Modelling (IWM), in Bangladesh, hosts a suite of
   hydrodynamic models that can estimate river stages and discharge, flood
   and groundwater levels and water quality variables for most rivers and
   regions of the country. In the past 10 years, there has been a growing
   capacity and capability of numerical modelling in IWM. However, there is
   pressing need to translate the outputs of these models into meaningful
   information for decision makers. ``What is the effect on Aman rice
   production from an increase in upstream water levels due to a new
   embankment on the Jamuna River?{''} ``What is the cost of infrastructure
   damage due to climate change induced sea level rise in Chittagong port
   area?{''} To address this knowledge gap, researchers at IWM have
   developed a water resources Decision Support System (DSS) that can use
   outputs from their mathematical models to simulate and predict likely
   impacts on key sectors, such as agriculture, infrastructure,
   environment, fisheries, navigation, etc. It is envisaged that this DSS
   will assist policy makers and planners by providing information about
   likely impacts of climate variability and water-related projects in
   Bangladesh. The DSS has also been designed to be a communication and
   educational tool for non-technical users and key project stakeholders.
   In this paper, the experiences and findings of the DSS
   conceptualization, development, testing and consultations with
   stakeholders are presented. The DSS is GIS-based and primarily data
   driven. However, it also has features of a model-driven DSS. At the
   heart of the DSS impact estimates are sector response functions, which
   consist of quantitative and qualitative relationships that describe how
   changes in the state of water resources will affect key sectors. For
   example, for the agriculture sector, response functions include
   empirical equations that estimate losses in rice yield depending on rice
   type, growth stage, water level, and duration of inundation. The impacts
   are presented in terms of yield loss in tonnes and also in monetary
   units, where relevant price data is available. The DSS users can thus
   gain insights of the risks associated with climate change and also the
   efficacy of different adaptation options.
   The development of DSSs is a key feature in IWM's long-term plan. This
   involves meeting the growing demand to advance from integrated modelling
   software to hydroinformatic objects, such as DSSs. This evolution should
   assist resource managers and decision makers to adapt better to climate
   change and chronic water-related challenges, such as arsenic
   contamination in groundwater. Further development of the DSS involve
   incorporating optimization routines that can generate adaptation options
   subject to constraints in the human and environmental systems.},

Abstract = {The Paris agreement focused global climate mitigation policy on limiting
   global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.
   Consequently, projections of hazards and risk are increasingly framed in
   terms of global warming levels rather than emission scenarios. Here, we
   use a multimethod approach to describe changes in extreme sea levels
   driven by changes in mean sea level associated with a wide range of
   global warming levels, from 1.5 to 5 degrees C, and for a large number
   of locations, providing uniform coverage over most of the world's
   coastlines. We estimate that by 2100 similar to 50\% of the 7,000+
   locations considered will experience the present-day 100-yr
   extreme-sea-level event at least once a year, even under 1.5 degrees C
   of warming, and often well before the end of the century. The tropics
   appear more sensitive than the Northern high latitudes, where some
   locations do not see this frequency change even for the highest global
   warming levels.},

   reveals the heterogeneity of preferences via two classes depending on
   risk perception: residents who may be described as ``unaware

   display ``informed solidarity{''}, generally in favour of this policy.
   Furthermore, people the more frequently exposed to the risk reveal an

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change are likely to exacerbate many problems
   that coastal areas already face. In this study, we used multinomial
   logistic regression to examine human perception of climate change based
   on a cross-sectional survey of 1253 individuals in coastal regions of
   Tanzania. This was complemented with time series analysis of 50-year
   meteorological data. The results indicate that self-rated ability to
   handle work pressure, self-rated ability to handle personal pressure and
   unexpected difficulties, age, region and educational status were
   significant predictors of perceived temperature change unlike ethnicity
   and gender. A disproportionately large percentage of respondents of all
   ages indicated that temperature was getting hotter between the past 10
   and 30 years. This observation was supported by the time series
   analysis. Although respondents also alluded to changes in rainfall
   patterns in the past 10-30 years, time series analysis of rainfall
   revealed a different scenario except for Mtwara region of Tanzania.
   Because there is agreement between respondents' perceptions of
   temperature and available scientific climatic evidence over the 50-year
   period, this study argues that when meteorological records are
   incomplete or unavailable, local perceptions of climatic changes can be
   used to complement scientific climatic evidence. Based on the spatial
   differentials in climate change perception observed in this study, there
   is opportunity for a more locally oriented adaptation dimension to
   climate policy integration, which has hitherto been underserved by both
   academics and policymakers.},

Abstract = {It is estimated that nearly one-third of India's population lives on the
   coast and is dependent on its resources. Shoreline erosion, storm surges
   and extreme events have resulted in severe loss of human life, damage to
   ecosystems and to property along the coast of India. Studies carried out
   in the Cuddalore region of South India reveal that this low-lying
   coastal zone, which suffered significant erosion during the last
   century, has been severely affected by the tsunami of 2004, storm floods
   and cyclones. In response to these impacts, a variety of coastal defense
   measures and adaptation strategies have been implemented in the region,
   although with only limited success. In order to inform future coastal
   planning in this region, the work reported here identifies a composite
   hazard line, seaward of which coastal flooding events will have a return
   interval of less than 1 in 100 years. The area landward of the coastal
   hazard line will be unaffected by 100 years of coastal erosion at
   present day rates. The study directly supports the Integrated Coastal
   Zone Management (ICZM) Plan of the Tamil Nadu State through the
   identification and assessment of coastal hazards and the overall
   vulnerability to coastal flooding and erosion. The key results from this
   pilot study will be used directly by the State of Tamil Nadu in the
   protection of the coastal livelihoods, better conservation measures and
   sustainable development along the coast. This study is a step toward
   mapping the hazard line for the entire coast of India that helps protect
   human lives and property.},

Title = {SALINE INTRUSION: A POTENTIAL RISK FOR COASTAL AQUIFER MANAGEMENT IN SEA
   LEVEL RISE SCENARIOS THE CASE STUDY OF AN ADAPTATION PLAN FOR THE
   MUNICIPALITY OF FANO},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-69},
Abstract = {The work reported in this paper is part of a European Union project
   called ASTERIS and co-funded by the Interreg Italy-Croatia Cross-Border
   Cooperation Programme. The paper summarises the expected environmental
   changes resulting from North Adriatic sea level rise due to climate
   change, and the findings of a risk analysis of saltwater intrusion in
   coastal aquifers, at both regional and local scale.
   Starting from this scenario, and through a review of best practices, we
   set up an adaption plan with a view to mitigating the environmental and
   socio-economic damage due to the expected increase in salinisation along
   the coastal aquifers in the municipality of Fano (Pesaro province,
   Marche region, Italy). The municipal adaptation plan identifies the
   actions to be taken for sustainable use of groundwater, i.e. maintaining
   freshwater baseflow towards the sea, relocating the pumping systems to
   lower the interface zone, and creating barriers to saltwater ingression.
   The suggested adaptation measures were spatially distributed on the
   basis of the hydrogeological effects expected in the different zones of
   the coastal aquifer. These measures involve different groups of
   stakeholders playing key roles in the use of groundwater resources:
   owners of domestic wells, industrial and commercial water users
   depending on groundwater resources, managers of integrated water
   systems, urban planners, farmers, and tourist operators. Particular
   emphasis was placed on surface water bodies inside the town, which are
   in direct connection with seawater and exposed to salt wedge seepage
   during summers. Monitoring transects and threshold values were
   established in selected test sites. With regard to the progression of
   the saltwater intrusion process in future decades, ``dynamic
   updating{''} of the adaptation plan, supported by field observations,
   appeared to be the most suitable method.},

Title = {``New Governance{''} in the Arctic and Its Role for Supporting Climate
   Change Adaptation},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE GOVERNANCE IN THE ARCTIC},
Series = {Environment \& Policy},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {97-116},
Abstract = {Formal Arctic governance has developed mainly since the 1990s when the
   eight-state Arctic Council was established to provide a common forum for
   national, indigenous peoples' and environmental interests. The Arctic is
   seen as encompassing the northernmost areas of the Nordic states, USA,
   Russia and Canada, thereby including areas that will be among those
   impacted the earliest by the effects of climate change on sea ice and
   permafrost. However, most of the pollution affecting the Arctic is not
   released in the area, and cohesion among the states in confronting the
   climate change problem has been limited. Based in interviews with
   organisations involved in new governance initiatives (high level fora,
   NGOs and international organisations) in the Arctic region, this chapter
   discusses the capacity of the Arctic governance framework to support
   adaptation to climate change. The paper views adaptation in governance
   as requiring horizontal and vertical interlinkage between actors, and
   outlines the interlinkages between regional actors as well as the
   resources (including funding and legislation) perceived by the
   interviewees as available to the organisations. The paper concludes that
   organisational capacities will need to be strengthened for effective
   implementation of adaptive actions.},

Title = {Measuring the impacts of a real-world neighborhood-scale cool pavement
   deployment on albedo and temperatures in Los Angeles},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to exacerbate the urban heat island (UHI)
   effect in cities worldwide, increasing the risk of heat-related
   morbidity and mortality. Solar reflective `cool pavement' is one of
   several mitigation strategies that may counteract the negative effects
   of the UHI effect. An increase in pavement albedo results in less heat
   absorption, which results in reduced surface temperatures (T (surface)).
   Near surface air temperatures (T (air)) could also be reduced if cool
   pavements are deployed at sufficiently large spatial scales, though this
   has never been confirmed by field measurements. This field study is the
   first to conduct controlled measurements of the impacts of
   neighborhood-scale cool pavement installations. We measured the impacts
   of cool pavement on albedo, T (surface), and T (air). In addition,
   pavement albedo was monitored after installation to assess its
   degradation over time. The field site (similar to 0.64 km(2)) was
   located in Covina, California; similar to 30 km east of Downtown Los
   Angeles. We found that an average pavement albedo increase of 0.18 (from
   0.08 to 0.26) corresponded to maximum neighborhood averaged T (surface)
   and T (air) reductions of 5 degrees C and 0.2 degrees C, respectively.
   Maximum T (surface) reductions were observed in the afternoon, while
   minimum reductions of 0.9 degrees C were observed in the morning. T
   (air) reductions were detected at 12:00 local standard time (LST), and
   from 20:00 LST to 22:59 LST, suggesting that cool pavement decreases T
   (air) during the daytime as well as in the evening. An average albedo
   reduction of 30\% corresponded to a similar to 1 degrees C reduction in
   the T (surface) cooling efficacy. Although we present here the first
   measured T (air) reductions due to cool pavement, we emphasize that the
   tradeoffs between T (air) reductions and reflected shortwave radiation
   increases are still unclear and warrant further investigation in order
   to holistically assess the efficacy of cool pavements, especially with
   regards to pedestrian thermal comfort.},

Title = {The emerging threats of climate change on tropical coastal ecosystem

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},

Volume = {101},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Climate change has significantly impacted tropical ecosystems critical
   for sustaining local economies and community livelihoods at global
   scales. Coastal ecosystems have largely declined, threatening the
   principal source of protein, building materials, tourism-based revenue,
   and the first line of defense against storm swells and sea level rise
   (SLR) for small tropical islands. Climate change has also impacted
   public health (i.e., altered distribution and increased prevalence of
   allergies, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases). Rapid human
   population growth has exacerbated pressure over coupled
   social-ecological systems, with concomitant non-sustainable impacts on
   natural resources, water availability, food security and sovereignty,
   public health, and quality of life, which should increase vulnerability
   and erode adaptation and mitigation capacity. This paper examines
   cumulative and synergistic impacts of climate change in the challenging
   context of highly vulnerable small tropical islands. Multiple adaptive
   strategies of coupled social-ecological ecosystems are discussed.
   Multi-level, multi-sectorial responses are necessary for adaptation to
   be successful. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses known and unknown risks for coastal communities and
   also challenges for university faculty and local government staff who
   communicate about cli- mate sciences. Conceived as a way to move beyond
   traditional models of science communication, this project involved
   public and private decision makers in specific at-risk communities in
   Oregon (U.S. Pacific coast) and Maine (Atlantic coast). Both state
   projects sought to move behavior toward decisive action that results in
   coastal communities that are more resilient to climate variability at
   all scales. To promote engagement between project staffs and publics, a
   dialogic model of communication was advanced, beginning with interviews
   and focus groups that in turn shaped further engagement through
   workshops and targeted video products. This means of communication led
   to a deeper understanding of participants' knowledge, beliefs,
   perceptions, values, and barriers to action related to climate change
   and its effects. Coinciding with this, project participant evaluations
   in both Oregon and Maine indicate that the workshops and videos were
   successful at informing them on this complex issue; and in both states,
   project participation led to action outcomes. We believe that applied
   elsewhere our multifaceted and adaptive approach will garner similar
   results, provided sufficient dedicated staffing and attention to
   methods.},

Title = {Natural and anthropogenic hazards in the African coastal and ocean
   environment: Need for holistic and pragmatic early warning system and

Abstract = {The African coastal and ocean environment span twenty two countries in
   the South and Central Eastern Atlantic ocean and nine countries in the
   Indian Ocean. According to the World Bank, the population of Africa is
   approximately 650 million which is projected to grow at a rate of no
   less than 3\% per year. With this growth rate, the population in the
   coastal urban area is expected to double within the next 30 years and by
   the year 2025, the urban coastal population will increase from a mean of
   200 inhabitants/km(2) to 500 inhabitants/km(2). The African coastal and
   ocean environment is richly blessed with a wide variety of living and
   non-living resources. Rapid industrial growth and the search for source
   of livelihood in the coastal cities have resulted in high pressures on
   the coastal resources. According to a Global Environmental facility
   report, the three greatest threats to the African coastal and ocean
   areas are pollution from land base activities, over exploitation of
   living resources, alteration and destruction of marine habitats. Global
   climate change and associated impacts like sea-level rise and flooding
   have been documented to have serious impacts on the socio-economic
   activities in both West and East African regions. The devastating mega
   thrust earthquake of December 26, 2004 in South East Asia produced
   gravity waves which propagated in the Indian Ocean for several hundreds
   of kilometers to reach the East African coast causing loss of lives and
   destruction of coastal infrastructure. Coastal storm surges caused by
   meteorological factors also cause widespread coastal flooding annually
   along the West African coast. While several national and International
   coastal and marine programmes are presently being implemented, many
   African coastal countries need international assistance to address
   coastal and marine hazards which are devastating the area. The need for
   an integrated and African-wide early warning system is now imperative to
   warn coastal population of impending hazards from flooding, earthquakes
   and other associated coastal hazards. Such an early warning system will
   also complement and ensure preparedness programmes to alleviate poverty
   and enhance national socio-economic developmental Such an early warning
   system should include a network of tide gauges, earth movement
   monitoring devices (seismographs) and effective communication system to
   enable near real time exchange of data, and warning information. A well
   coordinated early warning system will complement and ensure effective
   preparedness programmes and mitigating options. Flood and erosion
   mitigating options should also involve using appropriate and site
   specific methods. While sand nourishment is not a permanent solution,
   flood and erosion mitigating options involving hard structures like
   groins (gabion groins), breakwaters, revetments and bulkheads are
   examples of more permanent options. However, implementation of hard
   structures along the coast should as much as possible involve use of
   locally available technology, materials and resources. Also, before
   contemplating on any large scale flood and beach erosion control
   structures it is important to consider the likely future response of the
   beach (downdrift and updrift) in both long term and under extreme
   conditions. The main issues to consider here are:
   What will happen to the beach and the defenses behind if they experience
   severe storm?
   How will the beach respond in the long term to hard structures
   What will happen to the downdrift beach?
   These questions are better answered through field surveys, data and
   information compilation, numerical and physical modeling. Such a
   programme of action will require cooperation between national, regional
   and international programmes and agencies. National ownership of an
   early warning system and hazard mitigation programmes is an important
   ingredient to the success of any such programme.},

Abstract = {Global warming is causing increasing Heat Waves that affect human
   health. High temperatures markedly increase morbidity and mortality.
   Urban Heat Islands increase the effects of Heat Waves and are a serious
   inconvenience to human health and comfort. Cities can substantially
   increase local temperatures and reduce temperature drop at night. During
   the night, the greater thermal inertia of the central areas reduces
   their cooling capacity. On the other hand, it is important to highlight
   that urban vegetation plays a key role in adapting cities to Global
   Warming and Urban Heat Island. Green areas have lower temperatures than
   the rest of land uses and generate a cooling effect that spreads to
   their surroundings creating a ``cool island{''} effect. The main
   objective of this paper is to establish the nocturnal land surface
   temperature and land surface air temperature of Barcelona Metropolitan
   Area (35 municipalities, 636 km(2), 3.3 million inhabitants) in an
   episode of a nocturnal heatwave and to estimate its possible impact on
   health and mortality. Subsequently, nighttime temperatures are analysed
   in this extreme heat context to determine their spatial distribution and
   detect the urban landscapes that are most vulnerable to extreme night
   heat. Modelling of land surface temperature must reveal the elements
   that determine night Urban Heat Island and consequently identify actions
   that can be implemented at urban planning level to refresh the
   environment during the night and thus increase the resilience of the
   most vulnerable landscapes and improve residents' health. This paper
   studies the effect of urban greenery and green infrastructures on
   Nighttime Urban Heat Island and propose climate adaptation measures and
   design for urban green areas to decrease high temperature in a Heat Wave
   context, which contributes to reducing the serious negative impacts on
   people's health.},

Title = {Climate extremes can drive biological assemblages to early successional
   stages compared to several mild disturbances},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Extreme climatic events have a major role in the structuring of
   biological communities, and their occurrence is expected to increase due
   to climate change. Here I use a manipulative approach to test the
   effects of extreme storm events on rocky mid-shore assemblages. This
   study shows that an extreme storm can cause more negative effects than
   several mild storms, primarily by bringing the biological assemblages
   towards early stages of succession. This finding contrasts with the
   effects of clustering of climatic events due to climate change, which
   are expected to mitigate its ecological impacts. Thus, the ecological
   consequences of climatic events that are influenced by climate change
   may have contrasting effects depending on the features that are

Abstract = {Infrared maritime target tracking has been a typical application of
   infrared tracking techniques, and it remains a challenging task to
   design trackers with outstanding robustness and efficiency
   simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time
   infrared maritime target tracker based on adaptive context-aware and
   spatially-regularized discriminative correlation filters (ACSDCF). The
   adaptive context-aware strategy is utilized to incorporate more negative
   samples explicitly and suppress background interference. We design an
   automatic spatial regularization mechanism to alleviate the inherent
   drawbacks of correlation filter-based trackers by utilizing response map
   information. Moreover, an adaptive updating strategy based on response
   map variation is introduced to cast a tradeoff between tracking speed
   and accuracy. Extensive experimental results in different infrared
   maritime target sequences demonstrate that the comprehensive properties
   of the proposed ACSDCF, with a tracking speed of 40 + frames per second,
   are superior to state-of-the-art trackers.},

Abstract = {Climate change is pervasive, bringing about heat and floods. To address
   these hazards, better coping, adaptation and resilience are needed.
   Cities all over the world suffer from heat and flood disasters that
   account for significant losses. This paper examines the incidence of
   heat and flood occurrence in urban areas, and examines how sustainable
   urban drainage systems (SUDS) is used to combat them. The methodology is
   based on historical event analysis, literature review and secondary
   data. Results indicate that heat and flood hazards in cities can be
   effectively reduced by using SUD systems which incorporate vegetated
   surfaces that absorbs and retains rain water, purifies stormwater and
   transfers heat. Results show that SUD system reduces flood peaks and
   heat, thereby reducing the incidence of flash floods and heat islands.
   SUD system is recommended as a viable method of heat and flood control
   in cities as cities using SUDS were found to cope very well with heat
   and floods. Overall, technical measures of flood management such as SUDS
   are found to be effective, affordable, aesthetically pleasing and
   socially acceptable. A holistic strategy combing technical SUDSs and
   non-technical human aspects of coping and resilience is the key towards
   effective management of floods in cities.},

   physiological and behavioural selective agents},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities affect fish populations worldwide. River dams
   have profound impacts on ecosystems by changing habitats and hindering
   migration. In an effort to counteract such effects, a range of
   mitigation measures have been installed at hydroelectric power plants.
   However, not all individuals in a population use these measures,
   potentially creating strong selection processes at hydroelectric power
   plants. This may be especially true during migration; fish can get
   heavily delayed or pass through a hydropower turbine, thus facing
   increased mortality compared with those using a safe bypass route. In
   this study, we quantify migration route choices of descending wild
   passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged Atlantic salmon smolts
   released upstream from a hydroelectric plant. We demonstrate how only a
   few metres' displacement of bypass canals can have a large impact on the
   fish guidance efficiency (FGE). The proportion of fish using the
   bypasses increased from 1\% to 34\% when water was released in surface
   gates closer to the turbine intake. During a period of low FGE, we
   observed two different smolt migratory strategies. While some
   individuals spent little time in the forebay before migrating through
   the turbine tunnel, others remained there. We suggest that these groups
   represent different behavioural types, and that suboptimal mitigation
   measures at hydropower intakes may, therefore, induce strong selection
   on salmon behavioural traits. The ultimate outcome of these selection
   mechanisms is discussed in light of potential trade-offs between turbine
   migration mortality coast and optimal sea entrance timing survival
   benefits.},

   Perspective},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {271-276},
Abstract = {Massachusetts, like many coastal states in the US, stands to be impacted
   from climate-induced sea level rise. As a result, climate-sensitive
   coastal policy instruments are critical for providing adequate
   adaptation options, including an option to allow coastal features to
   migrate inland. But the migration of coastal features is under threat
   due to extensive private armoring. This essay highlights specific
   regulatory instruments at the federal and state level dealing with hard
   armoring using Massachusetts as an example. It argues specific federal
   and state regulations legitimize and incentivize hard armoring over
   other coastal land use planning methods. The current level of armoring
   in Massachusetts is highlighted and implications under current federal
   and state policy frameworks are explained. Suggestions for coastal
   states planning for sea level rise are discussed, including the need for
   state planning to take the lead. Recommendations for changes at the
   federal level are also highlighted.},

Abstract = {Worldwide, rice is the most important food staple. Climate change is
   expected to affect rice yields and overall rice production in tropical
   locations. With less than 10\% of rice produced traded internationally,
   there will be increasing pressure on the rice supply available for
   international trade to be retained to meet domestic market needs. Such a
   scenario would severely threaten food security in the Pacific islands,
   which are increasingly dependent on grain imports. The production of
   breadfruit and most other traditional crops is expected to be far less
   adversely impacted by climate change. Breadfruit is a high-yielding tree
   crop, the fruit of which can be converted to high quality gluten-free
   flour and starch. However, breadfruit is not yet cultivated as an
   orchard crop, which is necessary to achieve high-volume and low-cost
   production. For this reason, one of the key objectives of the Pacific
   Breadfruit Project is to establish breadfruit as a smallholder-based
   orchard crop. This paper reports on the progress being made in
   developing breadfruit orchards in Fiji and discusses their
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {We assessed the influence of the intertidal and salinity gradients and
   mangrove forest structure on C stocks and sequestration rates in
   mangrove soils of an estuarine system in Todos os Santos Bay, Eastern
   Brazil. The accumulation rates of organic C (C-org) during the last
   century varied between and within estuarine zones, ranging from 65 to
   1073 g C(org)m(-2)yr(-1). The mean stocks of C-org and N for the top 1 m
   soils were 263 +/- 14 Mg C-org ha(-1)and 11.8 +/- 0.4 Mg N ha(-1),
   respectively. We found a less variable distribution pattern on C-org and
   N stocks throughout the salinity gradient than along the intertidal
   gradient, being significantly higher at the fringe mangroves than at the
   interior forest. We estimated that Brazil, one of the major reservoirs
   of mangroves (similar to 10\%) on the planet, has 207 +/- 34 Tg C-org in
   the upper meter of soils, which represents 3-8\% of the C stored in
   mangrove soils globally. Given that Brazil is a Blue Carbon hotspot, it
   is emphasized the urgent need for the establishment of better mangrove
   conservation practices and a comprehensive evaluation of their value in
   climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for reducing CO2

   under acute temperature stress (-1? and 28?) and identified an extensive
   set of genes and pathways that respond to acute temperature stress.
   Physiological changes at the molecular level were compared to explore
   potential differences in the response of clams and their adaptation to
   temperature change and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of
   resilience or sensitivity to stress conditions in the two clam
   populations. The enrichment of genes involved in protein processing in
   the endo-plasmic reticulum was integral to the adaptation of clams to
   stressful conditions. Furthermore, phagosome-related genes and pathways
   were significantly enriched under acute high temperature stress. The
   upregulation of xenobiotic metabolism by cytochrome P450 showed a
   population-specific response in the low-latitude clams under both heat
   and cold stress but not in the high-latitude clams, whereas genes
   encoding peroxisomes were upregulated in high-latitude clams under heat
   stress but not in low-latitude clams. This study provides useful
   information related to the response of R. philippinarum to temperature
   stress, which could be helpful for improving the temperature stress
   resistance of these clams in the aquaculture industry. Our results may
   also help predict future biodiversity trends under temperature change
   scenarios.},

Title = {Understanding the variability of urban heat islands from local

Volume = {208},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation in urban areas is among the biggest challenges
   humanity faces partly because of the combined effects of urban heating
   and global warming. The variability of urban heat islands (VUHIs) is
   known to influence the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies;
   however, the understanding of VUHIs is still limited. Here, we
   quantified the diurnal and seasonal VUHIs in 245 Chinese cities that
   varied in population and physical size based on the remotely sensing
   data from 2002 to 2012. Taking the 2012 VUHIs as an example, we examined
   the relationships between VUHIs and underlying drivers of background
   climate and urbanization. The results showed that: (1) the VUHIs from
   2002 to 2012 had obvious periodicity in different years while
   significant diurnal and seasonal variability; (2) the explanation rates
   of local background climate for the diurnal VUHIs were 30\% (spring),
   19\% (summer), 29\% (autumn), and 25\% (winter), respectively; (3) the
   explanation rates of urbanization for the diurnal VUHIs were 13\%
   (spring), 22\% (summer), 11\% (autumn), and 21\% (winter), respectively;
   (4) these two variables also accounted for 32\% and 12\% of the seasonal
   VUHIs during the daytime, and 25\% and 23\% during the nighttime,
   respectively. Our research suggests that the improvement of urban
   climate-change adaptation necessitates local ``climate-smart{''}
   strategies, a reduction in local anthropogenic heat emissions, and
   rational use of green planning for sustainable urban development. (C)

Abstract = {Fisheries currently represent the main source of animal protein intake
   worldwide, although catches of most commercial species are at or beyond
   maximum sustainable yields. Increasing production would require an
   excess of exploitation levels and aquaculture is expected to become
   crucial in sustaining a growing seafood demand. Nonetheless, many
   threats are expected to affect aquaculture and the increased production
   must evolve in a way that minimizes environmental and socio-economic
   impacts. The claimed sustainable development of human activities at sea
   (blue growth and economy) seeks for new joint analyses and solutions at
   (trans-)national systemic level should be planned and applied. To meet a
   sustainable development, both production and management approaches
   should evolve. Here we propose a conceptual framework to integrate a
   ``downscaling approach{''} based on functional features of cultivated
   organisms to accommodate multiple stressors in setting sustainable
   development standards to design adaptive solutions fitting with the
   management of marine space.},

Title = {Understanding the transformation of climate futures. A conceptual
   framework illustrated with urban adaptation policy},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {76},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {30-41},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Projects in which science-based futures are produced indicating the
   relevant impacts of climatic changes are proliferating, in tandem with
   the increasing attention for climate change adaptation. Constructionist
   science studies have put forward the concept of `co-production' to
   understand how knowledge claims become stable, authoritative, get
   institutionalised and reorder science and society. Moreover, knowledge
   and structures of power are co-evolutionary. Exercises in constructing
   futures are interesting practices where what is and what ought are
   enmeshed, and where knowledge claims may in turn be performative for
   societal reordering. This article presents a conceptual framework to
   understand the transformation of knowledge claims about the future in
   more analytical detail. Five concepts are suggested to aid the analysis
   of transformations: reduction, extension, rhetorical packaging,
   modification and redefinition. This conceptual framework is used to
   present a qualitative, in-depth study about the transformation of the
   volatile issue of urban warming in the face of climate change in the
   Netherlands, and the related knowledge claims on the future of this
   issue. As this case makes clear, the constant erosion of legitimacy for
   urban warming as a matter of collective concern is important to
   understand the transformation of knowledge claims. Also, the context and
   organisational embedding in which the projects originated had direct
   consequences for the construction of relevant knowledge on future urban
   warming. Moreover, the pre-existing methodologies science brings to the
   production of knowledge functioned as important templates which
   transformed the issue of urban warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In Norway, floods are triggered by rainfall, or rainfall in combination
   with snowmelt. Most rivers have two or more flood seasons primarily in
   spring and autumn. Spring flood are the results of snowmelt often in
   combination with rainfall. These floods are typical floods in large
   inland river basins in eastern and northern Norway as well as in the
   mountain areas. Autumn floods are the results of intensive rainfall and
   commonly occur in the coastal regions. This paper aims to give an
   overview of flood situations and flood control in Norway. Historical
   floods and their damage are summarized. Structural flood control works
   and design flood frequencies are introduced. Non-structural flood
   mitigation measures, i.e. the hydrological observation stations and the
   data base, flood forecasting and warning system, emergency flood plan
   and social flood aid are described. In addition, environmentally-based
   flood mitigation and climate change which constitute important parts of
   flood control are addressed as well. Finally, the challenges of flooding
   and flood control in the future are highlighted.},

Abstract = {The academic literature on climate change communications is growing.
   However, the majority of this literature focuses on the issue of climate
   change mitigation in a developed country context, and there is little
   published material regarding communication in a developing country and
   adaptation context. Similarly, despite community-based approaches to
   climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction increasing in the
   Pacific Islands region, there is very limited guidance on how to
   effectively communicate climate change in a way that enhances people's
   resilience. This paper documents the experiences of organisations,
   including local and international non-government and faith-based
   organisations, governments, regional technical organisations and donor
   agencies in communicating climate change for adaptation in the Pacific
   region. Three key climate change communication challenges are
   highlighted and suggestions made for overcoming them based on results
   from interviews, a focus group discussion and an online forum. Finally,
   recommendations are made for good practice guidance in climate change
   communication that is empowering and culturally relevant.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {141},
Number = {4},
Pages = {685-701},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change could have large implications for the management of
   dune-fringed coasts. Sea level rise and changes in storm wave and surge
   characteristics could lead to enhanced dune erosion and hence a decrease
   in safety levels. Here, we use the process-based model XBeach to
   quantify the impact of sea level rise and changing hydrodynamic boundary
   conditions on the magnitude of future dune erosion at two locations
   along the Dutch coast. We find a linear relation between sea level rise
   and dune erosion volume, the exact linear relation being dependent on
   the local hydrodynamical boundary conditions. The process driving higher
   erosion appears to be sea level rise, allowing waves to attack the dune
   at a higher level. Additional simulations illustrate that a change in
   the offshore wave angle, potentially produced by changes in storm
   tracks, could influence the erosion volume with the same order of
   magnitude as sea level rise. Finally, simulations with different
   mitigation options (i.e., sand nourishments) illustrate the strong
   effect of the location of the added sand to the reduction in the dune
   erosion volume.},

Abstract = {Understanding precipitation changes over the Northern Hemisphere land
   monsoon (NHLM) region, where nearly 60\% of the world's population
   resides, is fundamental for hydrological projections and adaptations
   against climate change. There are many studies on the hydrological cycle
   under various climate change scenarios. However, there is still a lack
   of research on the hydrological responses to CO2 removal as a global
   warming mitigation measure from a global perspective. This study
   demonstrates the distinguished hysteresis responses of mean NHLM
   precipitation based on idealized CO2 ramp-up and ramp-down experiments
   using the Community Earth System Model|Community Earth System model. The
   Indian and North African monsoons have time asymmetry in the mean
   precipitation changes under the CO2 increase and decrease pathways,
   while the North American monsoon does not. The zonal contrasting
   hysteresis is attributed to longitudinally contrasting changes in the
   intertropical convergence zone position driven by the inter-hemispheric
   and land-sea thermal contrast. On the contrary, changes in extreme
   precipitation exhibit little temporal asymmetries over any of the NHLM
   domains. These results provide new insights into climate hysteresis of
   the hydrological cycle from regional and global perspectives.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities all over the world are experiencing unprecedented
   alterations from climate change. Unlike what most people would guess,
   coastal communities have not advanced much in their preparedness for a
   climate that is changing fast, despite their extensive exposure to
   climate hazards. If not true worldwide, at least that is what is
   happening in the majority of small and medium communities in the coast
   of New England, in the Northeast of US. This article explores data
   collected in a web survey conducted with city officials of coastal
   communities in the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,
   New Hampshire and Maine, aiming to verify barriers to address climate
   change adaptation at the local level. The results of the survey showed
   many similarities between the challenges experienced by these small
   coastal communities. We suggest that, in presenting the main themes of
   the research, including special attention to the barriers encountered,
   this knowledge can contribute to the creation of a more climate-friendly
   region, thus helping to design and implement future climate change
   policies at the local level.},

Title = {Trajectories of exposure and vulnerability of small islands to climate
   change},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {This article advocates for a dynamic and comprehensive understanding of
   vulnerability to climate-related environmental changes in order to feed
   the design of adaptation future pathways. It uses the trajectory of
   exposure and vulnerability (TEV) approach that it defines as `storylines
   of driving factors and processes that have influenced past and present
   territorial system exposure and vulnerability to impacts associated with
   climate variability and change.' The study is based on the analysis of
   six peer-reviewed Pacific island case studies covering various
   geographical settings (high islands vs low-lying reef islands, urban vs
   rural) and hazards associated with climate variability and change; that
   addressed the interactions between natural and anthropogenic driving
   factors; and adopted multidecadal past-to-present approaches. The
   findings emphasize that most urban and rural reef and high islands have
   undergone increasing exposure and vulnerability as a result of major
   changes in settlement and demographic patterns, lifestyles and
   economies, natural resources availability, and environmental conditions.
   The article highlights three generic and successive periods of change in
   the studied islands' TEV: from geopolitical and political over the
   colonization-to-political independence period; to demographic,
   socio-economic, and cultural from the 1960s to the 1980s; culminating in
   the dominance of demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and
   environmental drivers since the 1980s. Based on these empirical
   insights, the article emphasizes the existence of anthropogenic-driven
   path-dependency effects in TEV, thus arguing for the analysis of the
   temporal dimensions of exposure and vulnerability to be a prerequisite
   for science to be able to inform policy-and decision-making processes
   toward robust adaptation pathways. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Beach-dune system morphodynamics is probably one of the most classical
   coastal engineering problems. While the topic has been studied
   extensively and literature is plentiful of considerable research
   contributions, from the authors' knowledge the subject is still
   challenging for coastal and environmental sciences. As a part of the
   Special Issue entitled ``Beach-dune system morphodynamics{''} of this
   Journal, the present paper reviews traditional issues and design
   advances building bridges between potential risks and adaptation
   measures. The benefits of nature-based and hybrid solutions and the need
   for multidisciplinary studies and approaches to promote sustainable and
   resilient conservation of the coastal environment are emphasized.
   Considering the importance and complexity of the subject, this work
   cannot be fully complete. It is limited to providing a general overview
   and outlining some important directions intending to serve as a
   springboard for further research in the field of beach-dune system
   morphodynamics.},

Abstract = {The Karst area in Indonesia consists of a total area of 154.000 km(2) of
   which 15\% is protected. Pacitan is a part of The Thousand Mountains
   (Gunung Sewu in Javanese language) karst area and located in Southern
   Coastal of Java Island. Gunung Sewu karst area ranges over 85 km from
   west in Yogyakarta Special Province, to the east in East Java Province.
   Water scarcity is one of the issues in Pacitan due to the porous texture
   of the karst underground; most of the precipitation trickles immediately
   down into extensive system of sinkholes and caves. Thus, no surface
   water rivers, brooks or springs can be found in the area, especially
   during dry season where water supply, such as little lakes, called
   telaga, are depleted. Three sub-districts of Pacitan that include in
   Gunung Sewu karst area, i.e. Donorojo, Punung, and Pringkuku, suffer
   water shortage, especially during dry season, where the local
   communities need to walk up to 5 kilometers in order to take water for
   their domestic use. However, State-owned Water Company (Perusahaan
   Daerah Air Minum/PDAM) that has developed since 1992 in Pacitan,
   contributes in water supply in these areas and it has covered 70\% in
   three kecamatan (sub-districts) by building IPA and is currently
   developing to cover the rest of the area by utilizing big water sources.
   PDAM and The Ministry of Public Work support the water treatment
   installation (Instalasi Pengolahan Air/IPA), especially in these three
   sub-districts. Furthermore, adaptive capacity has been developed in the
   local community of karst area in Pacitan, e.g. planting cultivars
   resistant to drought (cassava, maize, soybean, and groundnut) or doing
   multi cropping between those cultivars, and planting rainwater
   harvesting and artificial aquifer. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The development of successful coastal adaptation strategies for both the
   built and natural environments requires combining scenarios of climate
   change and socio-economic conditions, and risk assessment. Such planning
   needs to consider the adaptation costs and residual damages over time
   that may occur given a range of possible storm conditions for any given
   sea level rise scenario. Using the metric of the expected value of
   annual adaptation costs and residual damages, or another metric that can
   be related to the elevation of flooding, a simplified method to carry
   this out is presented. The approach relies upon developing
   damage-flooding depth probability exceedance curves for various
   scenarios over a given planning period and determining the areas under
   the curves. While the approach does have limitations, it is less complex
   to implement than using Monte Carlo simulation approaches and may be
   more intuitive to decision makers. A case study in Maine, USA is carried
   out to illustrate the method.},

Title = {Index-based Approach to Evaluate City Resilience in Flooding Scenarios},

Abstract = {Intense rainfall events combined with high tide levels frequently result
   in urban floods in riverine or coastal cities. Their increasing
   variability and uncertainty demand urgent but sustained responses. Thus,
   resilience-driven approaches are emerging in contrast to the traditional
   technical-economic frameworks, as urban resilience reflects the overall
   capacity of a city to survive, adapt and thrive when experiencing
   stresses and shocks. This paper presents a simplified index-based
   methodology for the evaluation and quantification of urban resilience to
   flooding, based on the works developed in the EU H2020 RESCCUE project.
   A set of five indicators are proposed to compute the Integrated Urban
   Resilience Index (IURI), allowing to classify resilience according to a
   proposed range of rankings. This methodology considers simultaneously a
   multisectoral approach, reflecting services interdependences, and a
   sectorial approach, applying 1D/2D computational modelling of the urban
   drainage network. It was applied to the study case of Lisbon downtown,
   involving the analysis of interdependencies between 124 infrastructures
   of 10 urban services. Two scenarios were considered, respecting the
   current and future situations, considering climate changes. Results
   enhance the usefulness, practicability, and potential of the proposed
   approach, and improvement opportunities were also identified for future
   developments.},

Title = {Effects of the urban heat island and climate change on the growth of
   Khaya senegalensis in Hanoi, Vietnam},
Journal = {FOREST ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {BackgroundRecent projections expect that Vietnam will be affected most
   severely by climate change with higher temperatures, more precipitation
   and rising sea levels. Especially increased temperatures will worsen the
   situations in cities, amplifying the urban heat island effect. Green
   infrastructures, i.e. urban trees are a common tool to improve the urban
   micro-climate for humans. Vital and well growing trees provide greatest
   benefits such as evaporative cooling, shading, air filtering and carbon
   storage. However, urban tree growth is often negatively affected by
   urban growing conditions such as high soil sealing with compacted tree
   pits providing small growing spaces with limited water, nutrient and
   oxygen supply, further warm temperatures and high pollution emissions.
   This study analyzed the growth of urban and rural African mahogany
   (Khaya senegalensis (Desr.) A. Juss.) trees in the city of Hanoi,
   Vietnam and the effects of the surrounding climate conditions on tree
   growth.ResultsThe results showed that rural African mahogany trees grew
   better than trees situated in the city center, which is contrary to
   other results on tree growth of temperate and subtropical cities
   worldwide. Moreover tree growth was similar regardless of the time of
   growth. Other results regarding stem growth of African mahogany located
   in different areas of Hanoi (east, west, north, city center) revealed a
   better growth in the northern and western outskirts of the city compared
   to the growth of trees in the city center.ConclusionAfrican mahogany
   trees in the urban centers of Hanoi showed a decreased growth compared
   to rural trees, which was likely induced by a low ground-water level and
   high pollution rates. In view of climate change and global warming, the
   decreased tree growth in the city center may also affect tree service
   provision such as shading and cooling. Those climate mitigation
   solutions are strongly needed in areas severely affected by climate
   change and global warming such as Vietnam.},

Abstract = {Consequences resulting from future Climate Change may be one of the most
   severe threats for people and economies in many countries of the world.
   With respect to Coastal Protection, the resulting changed hydrodynamic
   impacts are discussed globally. At present, a world-wide average sea
   level rise of less than 1.0 m within the 21st century can be assumed to
   be reasonable order of magnitude. Nevertheless, other sources, which are
   taking into account possible melting of the two main continental ice
   covers, estimate significantly higher values, especially over long
   periods. Besides the problem of sea level rise, also possible general
   changes in the frequency and intensity of storms as well as general
   changes in the average wind field are discussed worldwide. With respect
   to the protection of the coast against flooding and erosion, possible
   future coastal protection strategies and also possible future coastal
   protection measures are analyzed and assessed. The content of this paper
   has been published also in Nova Acta Leopoldina({[}3])},

Abstract = {Existing wells pose a risk for the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from
   storage sites, which might compromise the suitability of carbon dioxide
   removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as
   climate change mitigation options. Here, we show results of a controlled
   CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical
   simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental
   consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our
   field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the
   detectability and impact of a leakage of < 55 t yr(-1) of CO2 would be
   limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid
   CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water
   column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal
   currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are
   found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only
   prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2
   storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many
   abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment,
   hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the
   most suitable areas for CO2 storage.},

Abstract = {A primary cause of soil erosion is the impact of rain. Therefore,
   understanding the altering rainfall characteristics and their effect on
   soil erosion is an issue of main concern. This is of utmost importance
   to contribute to developing suitable adaptation and mitigation
   strategies for soil and water resources conservation and crop management
   practices.
   The rainfall seasonality index (SI), precipitation concentration index
   (PCI) and modified Fournier index (MFI) for rainfall erosivity have been
   calculated and analysed in this study for the hyper-arid region of
   Sudan. The data used consist of monthly rainfall measurements spanning
   over 60 years for three index meteorological stations, two on the Nile
   corridor and one on the Red Sea coast. The region is characterized by
   high year-to-year variability in rainfall leading to extreme
   seasonality/irregular distribution of rainfall over the year. Although
   prevalent diminishing rainfall amounts have been witnessed, there are
   marked tendencies for some months to become wetter, indicating changing
   intra-annual rainfall variability and thus monthly rainfall erosivity.
   No statistically significant trends were observed in rainfall
   seasonality and concentration during the common data period of
   1945-2007. Cases of high and very high erosion powers were detected. A
   significant decreasing trend in erosivity is shown for one inland
   station. A brief discussion on the implications of these results for
   risk of soil erosion, freshwater quality and agriculture is also given.

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The aim of the research is to present a review of urban agriculture as
   synergic green and blue infrastructure solutions and to evaluate modern
   hybrid units with biomass and food production, and water retention in
   urbanized areas. The synergy between technologies of biomass production
   and water reuse provides the basis for the idea of self-sufficient urban
   units and sustainable agriculture. The research work defines the
   criteria and typology for urban resilience solutions. The analyses
   concern the correlation between production, management, retention, and
   reuse of water as a part of solutions for the model of a sustainable
   urban agriculture system in a compact city. The obtained results
   describe typology for cultivation and production in the modern city.
   Creating a resilient city connected with requirements posed by
   civilization concern changes in functional and spatial structure of the
   compact city. The discussion is supplemented with conclusions to the
   issue of synergy in urban planning, architecture, and engineering
   solutions. The article describes implementation technologies for city
   resilience in the context of agricultural production, energy and water
   management for the local community, and the ecosystem services in the

Title = {Urban water management and climate change adaptation: A self-assessment
   study by seven midsize cities in the North Sea Region},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cities are experiencing the impacts of climate change through
   water-related disasters, while the sustainable management of water
   resources remains crucial for urban climate resilience. Accordingly,
   frameworks that integrate urban water management with climate change
   adaptation become increasingly relevant. The Water Sensitive Cities
   (WSC) framework is built on three pillars that address cities' role as
   communities and networks, water catchments, and providers of ecosystem
   services. A major element of the framework is the WSC index, which can
   be applied to assess cities by using multiple indicators under each
   pillar. With the objectives of adjusting and testing the WSC index in
   the context of the North Sea Region through a transdisciplinary
   knowledge co-production process, this paper presents the results from a
   self-assessment conducted by seven midsize cities. Insights gained from
   the comparison of self-assessment results are twofold. Firstly, the
   cities need to value the benefits of ecosystem services for climate
   change adaptation, and integrate climate change into other sectors.
   Secondly, the cities differ regarding the priority of climate change,
   and even the cities that aspire to be frontrunners have weaknesses. The
   application of the self-assessment process also creates an exchange and
   mutual learning platform for cities, and increases their awareness on
   climate resilience.},

Title = {Adaptive governance of recreational ecosystem services following a major
   hurricane},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Despite the popularity of coastal recreational ecosystem services, and
   their linked synergies and tradeoffs with regulating and provisioning
   ecosystem services, there is uncertainty over integration into
   decision-making. There are few empirical analyses of decision-making,
   and ``governance is largely ignored{''} (Primmer et al., 2015, pg. 158).
   This case study details decision-making following a major coastal
   hazard, Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Mexico, in the United States
   (U.S.). It illustrates how collaborative adaptive governance of
   recreational ecosystem services enhances coastal resilience, or the
   ability to recover after a hazard. Evidence of resilience centered
   policy is surprising in the U.S. state of Texas, a conservative
   subnational area where the denial of climate change science is popular
   in the epicenter of the U.S. oil and gas industry. This research
   suggests the devastating hurricane and the popularity of recreational
   ecosystem services provided a window of opportunity for policy makers to
   address resilience, which would have been otherwise impossible for
   political reasons. As part of this process, decision-makers and
   stakeholders 1) sought out new and innovative funding sources for rapid
   recreational infrastructure repairs focused on resilience, 2) prevented
   the loss of public waterfronts and small businesses in the nature based
   recreational economy that constitute major parts of local identity, and
   3) enhanced decision maker capacity to include local ecological
   knowledge in novel and potentially transformative ways. Recreational
   ecosystem services, due to their obvious economic importance and
   popularity, may act as unifying symbols to decision-makers, allowing
   them enact policy to respond to climate impacts and to conserve
   ecosystem services in places where this is otherwise politically
   unpopular.},

Title = {Characterizing the spatial heterogeneity and controlling factors of land
   surface temperature clusters: A case study in Beijing},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The spatial variation in land surface temperature (LST) is a measure of
   the exchange and interaction of energy flux between the land surface and
   near-surface atmosphere. Understanding the connections between LST and
   complex landscape patterns is vital for selecting proper mitigation
   strategies to improve the urban thermal environment. However, the high
   spatial heterogeneity of the urban landscape makes it tricky to
   accurately characterizing the quantitative contributions from man-made
   or natural objects. In this study, we first estimated LST with Landsat-8
   TIRS by applying a split-window algorithm. We then grouped the urban
   landscape into 10 urban function zones (UFZs) and classified these UFZs
   as LST hot or cool spots. We used stepwise regression to examine the
   relationships between surface temperatures in hot and cool spots and 7
   climate-sensitive parameters. We obtained some interesting results: (1)
   Urban thermal environment is highly heterogeneous at the scale of UFZ.
   Every UFZ can be partitioned into both hot and cool spots. (2) The
   prediction accuracy of LST is found to be dependent on a combination of
   different parameters. The 2-dimensional parameters were more effective
   in predicting LST than the 3-dimensional parameters according to the
   stepwise regression analyses. (3) A new 3-dimensional parameter
   (sun-view factor-SunVF) adopted in this study, provides an alternative
   option in characterizing the variation of LST of various landscape
   structures. The results of this study provide insights into how the
   current spatial pattern of LST formed and into which mitigation
   strategies can be applied to improve the urban thermal environment.},

Title = {An Adaptive, Situation-Based Risk Assessment and Security Enforcement
   Framework for the Maritime Sector},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Maritime processes involve actors and systems that continuously change
   their underlying environment, location and threat exposure. Thus, risk
   mitigation requires a dynamic risk assessment process, coupled with an
   adaptive, event driven security enforcement mechanism, to efficiently
   deal with dynamically evolving risks in a cost efficient manner. In this
   paper, we propose an adaptive security framework that covers both
   situational risk assessment and situational driven security policy
   deployment. We extend MITIGATE, a maritime-specific risk assessment
   methodology, to capture situations in the risk assessment process and
   thus produce fine-grained and situation-specific, dynamic risk
   estimations. Then, we integrate DynSMAUG, a situation-driven security
   management system, to enforce adaptive security policies that
   dynamically implement security controls specific to each situation. To
   validate the proposed framework, we test it based on maritime cargo
   transfer service. We utilize various maritime specific and generic
   systems employed during cargo transfer, to produce dynamic risks for
   various situations. Our results show that the proposed framework can
   effectively assess dynamic risks per situation and automate the
   enforcement of adaptive security controls per situation. This is an
   important improvement in contrast to static and situation-agnostic risk
   assessment frameworks, where security controls always default to
   worst-case risks, with a consequent impact on the cost and the
   applicability of proper security controls.},

Abstract = {Coastal risk management has received increasing attention from
   policy-makers and practitioners over the last 20 years. The introduction
   by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), of a
   new approach to coastal risk management in England, led to the
   Environment Agency being given overall responsibility for the management
   of coastal risks in 2007. The establishment of a framework for coastal
   management, together with appropriate policy guidance, is particularly
   important on account of the increasing influence that predicted climate
   change may have on coastal economies, infrastructure, communities and
   conservation interests over the next century. Within this framework, the
   issue of coastal land instability is now being considered alongside the
   hazards of coastal erosion and flooding. In developing coastal
   management policies, and in deciding on whether coastal change should be
   adapted to rather than prevented, the availability of funding for
   coastal risk management projects and schemes is often an overriding
   consideration. This is encouraging new and innovative approaches for the
   avoidance of risks, through the implementation of adaptation strategies
   and the publication of improved advice and guidance. This paper
   describes recent policy guidance for coastal cliffs introduced in
   England and Wales, as well as the testing of new approaches in the
   field, and provides examples of updated tools to support engagement with
   stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Growth regulation in adult Atlantic salmon (1.6 kg) was investigated
   during 45 days in seawater at 13, 15, 17, and 19 A degrees C. We focused
   on feed intake, nutrient uptake, nutrient utilization, and endocrine
   regulation through growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factors
   (IGF), and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP). During prolonged thermal
   exposure, salmon reduced feed intake and growth. Feed utilization was
   reduced at 19 A degrees C after 45 days compared with fish at lower
   temperatures, and body lipid storage was depleted with increasing water
   temperature. Although plasma IGF-1 concentrations did not change, 32-Da
   and 43-kDa IGFBP increased in fish reared at a parts per thousand
   currency sign17 A degrees C, and dropped in fish reared at 19 A degrees
   C. Muscle igf1 mRNA levels were reduced at 15 and 45 days in fish reared
   at 15, 17, and 19 A degrees C. Muscle igf2 mRNA levels did not change
   after 15 days in response to increasing temperature, but were reduced
   after 45 days. Although liver igf2 mRNA levels were reduced with
   increasing temperatures after 15 and 45 days, temperature had no effect
   on igf1 mRNA levels. The liver igfbp2b mRNA level, which corresponds to
   circulating 43-kDa IGFBP, exhibited similar responses after 45 days.
   IGFBP of 23 kDa was only detected in plasma in fish reared at 17 A
   degrees C, and up-regulation of the corresponding igfbp1b gene indicated
   a time-dependent catabolic response, which was not observed in fish
   reared at 19 A degrees C. However, higher muscle ghr mRNA levels were
   detected in fish at 17 and 19 A degrees C than in fish at lower
   temperatures, indicating lipolytic regulation in muscle. These results
   show that the reduction of muscle growth in large salmon is mediated by
   decreased igf1 and igf2 mRNA levels in addition to GH-associated
   lipolytic action to cope with prolonged thermal exposure. Accordingly,
   13 A degrees C appears to be a more optimal temperature for the growth
   of adult Atlantic salmon at sea.},

Abstract = {Coral is the life-form that underpins the habitat of most tropical reef
   ecosystems, thereby supporting biological diversity throughout the
   marine realm. Coral reefs are undergoing rapid change from ocean warming
   and nearshore human activities, compromising a myriad of services
   provided to societies including coastal protection, fishing, and
   cultural practices. In the face of these challenges, large-scale
   operational mapping of live coral cover within and across reef
   ecosystems could provide more opportunities to address reef protection,
   resilience, and restoration at broad management- and policy-relevant
   scales. We developed an airborne mapping approach combining laser-guided
   imaging spectroscopy and deep learning models to quantify, at a large
   archipelago scale, the geographic distribution of live corals to 16-m
   water depth throughout the main Hawaiian islands. Airborne estimates of
   live coral cover were highly correlated with field-based estimates of
   live coral cover (R-2 = 0.94). Our maps were used to assess the relative
   condition of reefs based on live coral, and to identify potential coral
   refugia in the face of human-driven stressors, including marine heat
   waves. Geospatial modeling revealed that water depth, wave power, and
   nearshore development accounted for the majority (>60\%) of live coral
   cover variation, but other human-driven factors were also important.
   Mapped interisland and intraisland variation in live coral location
   improves our understanding of reef geography and its human impacts,
   thereby guiding environmental management for reef resiliency.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews information from the literature and the EU ArcRisk
   project to assess whether climate change results in an increase or
   decrease in exposure to mercury (Hg) in the Arctic, and if this in turn
   will impact the risks related to its harmful effects. It presents the
   state-of-the art of knowledge on atmospheric mercury emissions from
   anthropogenic sources worldwide, the long-range transport to the Arctic,
   and it discusses the likely environmental fate and exposure effects on
   population groups in the Arctic under climate change conditions. The
   paper also includes information about the likely synergy effects
   (co-benefits) current and new climate change polices and mitigation
   options might have on mercury emissions reductions in the future. The
   review concludes that reductions of mercury emission from anthropogenic
   sources worldwide would need to be introduced as soon as possible in
   order to assure lowering the adverse impact of climate change on human
   health. Scientific information currently available, however, is not in
   the position to clearly answer whether climate change will increase or
   decrease the risk of exposure to mercury in the Arctic. New research
   should therefore be undertaken to model the relationships between
   climate change and mercury exposure.},

Title = {Short-term impact of sediment addition on plants and invertebrates in a
   southern California salt marsh},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {The implementation and monitoring of management strategies is integral
   to protect coastal marshes from increased inundation and submergence
   under sea-level rise. Sediment addition is one such strategy in which
   sediment is added to marshes to raise relative elevations, decrease
   tidal inundation, and enhance ecosystem processes. This study looked at
   the plant and invertebrate community responses over 12 months following
   a sediment addition project on a salt marsh located in an urbanized
   estuary in southern California, USA. This salt marsh is experiencing
   local subsidence, is sediment-limited from landscape modifications, has
   resident protected species, and is at-risk of submergence from sea-level
   rise. Abiotic measurements, invertebrate cores, and plant parameters
   were analyzed before and after sediment application in a
   before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. Immediately following the
   sediment application, plant cover and invertebrate abundance decreased
   significantly, with smothering of existing vegetation communities
   without regrowth, presumably creating resulting harsh abiotic
   conditions. At six months after the sediment application treatment,
   Salicornia bigelovii minimally colonized the sediment application area,
   and Spartina foliosa spread vegetatively from the edges of the marsh;
   however, at 12 months following sediment application overall plant
   recovery was still minimal. Community composition of infaunal
   invertebrates shifted from a dominance of marsh-associated groups like
   oligochaetes and polychaetes to more terrestrial and more mobile
   dispersers like insect larvae. In contrast to other studies, such as
   those with high organic deposition, that showed vegetation and
   invertebrate community recovery within one year of sediment application,
   our results indicated a much slower recovery following a sediment
   addition of 32 cm which resulted in a supratidal elevation with an
   average of 1.62 m (NAVD88) at our sampling locations. Our results
   indicate that the site did not recover after one year and that recovery
   may take longer which illustrates the importance of long-term monitoring
   to fully understand restoration trajectories and inform adaptive
   management. Testing and monitoring sea-level rise adaptation strategies
   like sediment addition for salt marshes is important to prevent the loss
   of important coastal ecosystems.},

Title = {Rapid adaptation to crisis events: Insights from the bait crisis in the
   Maine lobster fishery},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {926-942},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change, overfishing, and other anthropogenic drivers are forcing
   marine resource users and decision makers to adapt-often rapidly. In
   this article we introduce the concept of pathways to rapid adaptation to
   crisis events to bring attention to the double-edged role that
   institutions play in simultaneously enabling and constraining swift
   responses to emerging crises. To develop this concept, we draw on
   empirical evidence from a case study of the iconic Maine lobster
   (Homarus americanus) industry. In the Gulf of Maine, the availability of
   Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) stock, a key source of bait in the
   Maine lobster industry, declined sharply. We investigate the patterns of
   bait use in the fishery over an 18-year period (2002-2019) and how the
   lobster industry was able to abruptly adapt to the decline of
   locally-sourced herring in 2019 that came to be called the bait crisis.
   We found that adaptation strategies to the crisis were diverse, largely
   uncoordinated, and imperfectly aligned, but ultimately led to a
   system-level shift towards a more diverse and globalized bait supply.
   This shift was enabled by existing institutions and hastened an
   evolution in the bait system that was already underway, as opposed to
   leading to system transformation. We suggest that further attention to
   raceways may be useful in understanding how and, in particular, why
   marine resource users and coastal communities adapt in particular ways
   in the face of shocks and crises.},

Abstract = {Due to the effects of climate change over the course of the next
   century, the combination of rising sea levels, severe storms, and
   coastal change will threaten the sustainability of coastal communities,
   development, and ecosystems as we know them today. To clearly identify
   coastal vulnerabilities and develop appropriate adaptation strategies
   due to projected increased levels of coastal flooding and erosion,
   coastal managers need local-scale hazards projections using the best
   available climate and coastal science. In collaboration with leading
   scientists world-wide, the USGS designed the Coastal Storm Modeling
   System (CoSMoS) to assess the coastal impacts of climate change for the
   California coast, including the combination of sea-level rise, storms,
   and coastal change. In this project, we directly address the needs of
   coastal resource managers in Southern California by integrating a vast
   range of global climate change projections in a thorough and
   comprehensive numerical modeling framework. In Part 1 of a two-part
   submission on CoSMoS, methods and the latest improvements are discussed,
   and an example of hazard projections is presented.},

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Estimates indicate that by 2050, 70\% of the world's population will
   live in urban areas, expanding the total built-up space and density of
   those areas. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon causes increased
   temperatures in urban areas compared to outlying regions. It is
   considered one of the main anthropogenic climate modifications and is
   directly linked to land-use patterns. The objective of this study was to
   analyze the presence of the UHI effect, diurnal and nocturnal, in the
   dry season in 21 Brazilian metropolitan areas from 2000 to 2016. Surface
   temperature, mean albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) values generated by the MODIS sensor (Moderate-resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer) were used. The results obtained showed substantial
   differences between diurnal and nocturnal UHI effects. Manaus, Porto
   Alegre, Belem, and Recife presented the highest values of diurnal UHI,
   whereas Curitiba, Brasilia, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro showed higher
   heat island effects at night. The results are an alert to policymakers
   of the need to rethink land occupation regulations and also give support
   to actions to mitigate the phenomenon.},

Title = {Proactive Management of Microgrids for Resiliency Enhancement: An

Abstract = {Deploying microgrids (mu Gs) with the capability of islanding and
   self-supply can considerably enhance power system resilience in coping
   with weather events. To this end, practical methods are needed in order
   to operationally position and manage the mu G to optimally control its
   resources and minimize the risk in the face of such disturbances. This
   paper proposes a two-stage adaptive robust formulation for mu G
   predisturbance scheduling to minimize the damaging consequences of
   islanding events. The approach considers different uncertainties and
   obtains the best day-ahead schedule for the mu G, which is robust
   against realization of uncertain parameters. An appropriate
   decomposition strategy, called column-and-constraint generation
   algorithm, is adopted to efficiently solve the problem, and ``budget of
   uncertainty{''} parameters are introduced to control the conservatism of
   the robust solution. The effectiveness of the novel framework is
   evaluated and discussed on a mu G using a set of illustrative case
   studies. The simulations show that the framework mitigates the huge cost
   of load shedding at the expense of a small increase in the
   predisturbance preparation cost. The advantages of our model are
   particularly remarkable when a weather event will come through, and a
   significant level of uncertainty exists.},

Abstract = {Scientific evidence suggests that agriculture will be adversely affected
   by climate change globally in the near future, with the countries and
   small islands of South Asia projected to be amongst the most vulnerable.
   This study uses the ORANI-G-SL, a single-country, static computable
   general equilibrium model to investigate the economic impacts of climate
   change-induced agricultural productivity changes on Sri Lanka, as a
   South Asian case study. In comparison with a baseline scenario, the
   results show reductions in the output of most agricultural crops will
   cause increased consumer prices for these agri-cultural commodities,
   with a consequential decline in overall household consumption within
   next few decades. The projected decline in crop production and increases
   in food prices will enhance the potential for food insecurity. Thus,
   climate change will negatively impact the overall GDP and most of the
   macro and microeconomic variables of the Sri Lankan economy. These
   results highlight the need for future scientific research on climate
   change adaptation strategies and the importance of developing policy
   responses to counter adverse effects on agriculture and food
   security.(c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published

Abstract = {In the western US-Mexico border region, both countries' authorities look
   to desalination as a means to meet increased demands for dwindling
   supplies. In addition to several existing or planned desalination
   plants, plans exist to develop projects along Mexico's coasts to convert
   seawater into freshwater primarily for conveyance and consumption in the
   United States. Even though desalination systems have the potential to
   increase water supply in the region, there are associated consequences,
   costs and constraints. To understand the impacts of such binational
   desalination systems, this paper assesses, through a water-security
   framework, the case of a proposed desalination plant on the Upper Gulf
   of California. The analysis suggests that for binational desalination
   systems, there are several key areas of impact against which the
   benefits of increased water supply must be weighed.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the challenges faced by women in coastal
   villages in selected districts of Tamil Nadu due to impact of climatic
   changes. One hundred coastal women beneficiaries from coastal districts
   of Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam were selected
   for the study. Descriptive statistics and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses,
   opportunities and threats) analysis were used to examine the data.
   Results of the study revealed that gender, age and community of the
   respondents had influence over the access to different sets of resources
   and livelihood assets. Drudgery of women increased after migration of
   men to urban areas in search of job. It is understood that livelihood
   patterns of women have changed considerably. Strengths expressed were
   knowledge, leadership qualities, self confidence and group cohesiveness,
   while the weaknesses identified were lack of knowledge, lack of
   technical knowledge, male migration, social taboos and beliefs as well
   as poor health status. The opportunities were government institutional
   support as well as research organisation support The threats identified
   were unusual rainfall, floods, cyclone and change in water quality. It
   is understood that women need access to training, credit and
   skills-development programmes to ensure their full participation in
   climate change initiatives. Participation of women in negotiations,
   policy actions and initiatives towards environmental change will help
   governments and coastal communities to maintain and build adaptive
   measures towards the effects of climate driven environmental changes in
   the coastal villages.},

Title = {The contribution of ocean-based solutions to carbon reduction in China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {797},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Climate change has become a great challenge for humanity. However, the
   current climate change mitigation measures, primarily concentrate on
   land, more or less neglecting the vital role of the ocean-based
   solutions. While the ocean is a crucial regulator of the global climate,
   ocean-based solutions could also play an essential role in climate
   change mitigation and policymaking. This paper developed an Ocean-based
   Solutions Carbon Reduction Assessment Model (OSCRAM) that addresses
   coastal ecosystems, ocean energy, marine transportation, fishery, and
   seabed to estimate the oceanic contribution to climate change
   mitigation. It has been applied to evaluate the capacity of carbon
   emission reduction through oceans in China. We found that the total
   contribution for carbon emission reduction was about 6.86 Tg CO2 per
   year, and it may reach 139.39 Tg in 2030 under the target scenario. The
   results indicated that the ocean has huge potential to reduce carbon
   emissions. The development of marine energy and low-carbon marine
   shipping may have more potential for emission reduction in China, and
   the government should also protect and restore coastal wetlands for
   their enormous carbon storage. It can also provide a reference for the
   globe and other nations in achieving emission reduction goals. (C) 2021

Title = {Historical and future naturalization of Magallana gigas in the Galician

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {838},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Magallana gigas is a naturalized species on the north coast of Galicia
   (Rias Altas, Northwest Iberian Peninsula), where it was unintentionally
   introduced. In recent decades, a greater abundance of M. gigas has been
   observed on the Galician coast, expanding towards the south, reaching
   the Artabro Gulf (Rias Centrales, NW Galician coast), probably due to
   ocean warming. Although this species has been cultivated in the Rias
   Baixas since the early 1990s and spawning has been reported, recruitment
   was never observed, which is likely due to the cold water upwelled
   during the spawning months. The future rise in seawater temperature may
   favor the naturalization of the non-indigenous species M. gigas
   southwards, in the Rias Baixas. Thermally, the Ria de Arousa seems to be
   the most favorable estuary for the future settlement of M. gigas, which
   may occur in the next decades. The extent of thermally favorable zones
   within estuaries is projected to increase rapidly bymid-century, and
   reaching 100\% of the estuarine area by the end of the century. As has
   already happened in other areas of the world, the expansion and
   naturalization of the Pacific oyster on the Galician coast will likely
   affect the native communities and economic activities, making it
   necessary to implement monitoring and management strategies to mitigate
   its effect.},

Title = {Geospatial modelling of tropical cyclone risk along the northeast coast
   of Oman: Marine hazard mitigation and management policies},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Globally, an increasing and more dispersed population, as well as
   climate change, have led to growing impacts of environmental hazards,
   particularly across areas prone to extreme weather events such as
   tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones frequently cause fatalities, damage
   to infrastructure, and disruption to economic activities. The north and
   northeast regions of Oman, particularly the Oman seacoast, are prone to
   the storm surges, windstorms and extreme precipitation events associated
   with these tropical storms. However, integrated spatial risk
   assessments, for the purpose of mapping cyclone risk at subnational
   geographic scales, have not yet been developed in this area. Here we
   evaluate and map cyclone risk using four independent components of risk:
   hazard, exposure, vulnerability and mitigation capacity. An integrated
   risk index was calculated using a geographical information system (GIS)
   and an analytical hierarchical process (AHP) technique, based on a
   geodatabase including 17 variables (i.e., GIS data layers) and criteria,
   with rank and weight scores for each criterion. The resulting risk
   assessment reveals the spatial variation in cyclone risk across the
   study area and highlights how this variation is controlled by variations
   in physical hazard, exposure, vulnerability and emergency preparedness.
   The risk maps reveal that, despite their perceived adaptive capacity for
   disaster mitigation, the population and assets in low-lying lands
   situated near the coastline in the east of Muscat, as well as the
   Al-Batnah south governorates, are at high risk due to cyclones.
   Furthermore, the coastal zones of the urban Wilayats of the Muscat
   governorate were also found to be at high, to very high, risk. This
   study has several policy implications and can provide effective
   guidelines for natural hazard preparedness and mitigation across the
   northern coasts of Oman.},

Title = {Resilience in landscape exploitation systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {201},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {440-452},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {A generic model is developed that describes the broad properties of
   land-exploitation systems from hunting-gathering societies to modern,
   intensive agriculture. The framework includes social, economic and
   ecological drivers of change, going beyond the concept of
   ``sustainability{''} to establish a paradigm of ``resilient
   exploitation{''} that calculates the capacity of landscape exploitation
   systems to survive in uncertain and variable human and natural
   environments. The model is highly aggregated, consisting of two state
   variables: (1) human-made capital and labour (H) and (2) natural capital
   (N). Depending on the parameters, the model displays a single
   non-trivial equilibrium, two equilibria, or stable limit cycles. Our
   analysis focuses on the strategies that exploiters employ, through
   varying their investment in H, and how this affects resilience of the
   system. We measure resilience as the size of the basin of attraction
   near a desirable equilibrium and the return time following small
   perturbations. Four general strategies are analysed and discussed using
   grazing systems as a particular example: (1) constant stocking rate, (2)
   maintaining grass stock, (3) constant utilization rate, and (4) a
   non-linear, compound strategy.
   Like previous models of renewable resources, maximum sustainable yield
   and profit are determined by properties of the renewable resource, so
   all management strategies yield identical long-term sustainable
   production and identical equilibria. However, different management
   strategies drastically change the system's resilience. We assess the
   opportunity cost of the disparate objectives of resilience and
   profitability using multi-objective optimization and demonstrate that
   resilience decreases rapidly as maximum profit is approached. Thus, the
   same stable and sustainable equilibrium point in an exploitation system
   will be more or less resilient depending on the exploiter's strategy.
   Traditional economic analysis does not consider the impact of the
   management strategy employed to drive the system towards these long-term
   equilibria, and therefore misses large differences in dynamical
   behaviour away from equilibrium. The possibility of multiple steady
   states in these non-linear systems results in the potential for a
   discontinuous ``threshold{''} in resilience, to one side of which
   resilience is maintained, while on the other resilience and production
   are greatly degraded. We further discuss how subsidies might increase or
   decrease resilience of exploitation systems by affecting an exploiter's
   strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As rates of global warming increase rapidly, identifying species at risk
   of decline due to climate impacts and the factors affecting this risk
   have become key challenges in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we
   present a framework for assessing three components of climate-related
   risk for species: vulnerability, exposure and hazard. We used the
   relationship between the observed response of species to climate change
   and a set of intrinsic traits (e.g. weaning age) and extrinsic factors
   (e.g. precipitation seasonality within a species geographic range) to
   predict, respectively, the vulnerability and exposure of all
   data-sufficient terrestrial non-volant mammals (3,953 species).
   Combining this information with hazard (the magnitude of projected
   climate change within a species geographic range), we identified global
   hotspots of species at risk from climate change that includes the
   western Amazon basin, south-western Kenya, north-eastern Tanzania,
   north-eastern South Africa, Yunnan province in China, and mountain
   chains in Papua-New Guinea. Our framework identifies priority areas for
   monitoring climate change effects on species and directing climate
   mitigation actions for biodiversity.},

Abstract = {This study for the first time assesses the influence of employing solar
   reflective ``cool{''} walls on the urban energy budget and summertime
   climate of the Los Angeles basin. We systematically compare the effects
   of cool walls to cool roofs, a heat mitigation strategy that has been
   widely studied and employed, using a consistent modeling framework (the
   Weather Research and Forecasting model). Adoption of cool walls leads to
   increases in urban grid cell albedo that peak in the early morning and
   late afternoon, when the ratio of solar radiation onto vertical walls
   versus horizontal surfaces is at a maximum. In Los Angeles County, daily
   average increase in grid cell reflected solar radiation from increasing
   wall albedo by 0.80 is 9.1 W m(-2), 43\% of that for increasing roof
   albedo. Cool walls reduce canyon air temperatures in Los Angeles by 0.43
   K (daily average), with the peak reduction (0.64 K) occurring at 09:00
   LST and a secondary peak (0.53 K) at 18:00 LST. Per 0.10 wall (roof)
   albedo increase, cool walls (roofs) can reduce summertime daily average
   canyon air temperature by 0.05 K (0.06 K). Results reported here can be
   used to inform policies on urban heat island mitigation or climate
   change adaptation.},

Abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) plays a fundamental role in achieving urban
   pluvial flood management, mitigating urban heat island effect, and
   improving living suitability. Residents' participation is the main
   driving force of GI implementation. Based on semi-structured interviews,
   GIS spatial analysis, and multiple regression, we investigated
   residents' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI in
   public and private space and identified the influence factors in
   Shanghai, China. The results show that, compared with private space,
   residents prefer to implement GI in public space, where they have
   different preferences of GI measures. On urban scale, residents'
   willingness to participate in the implementation of GI in private space
   is characterized as ``high in the inner city, low in the suburban
   areas{''}, while the spatial difference is insignificant for public
   space. In addition, the factors affecting residents' willingness to
   participate in the implementation of GI are different in private and
   public space. The deterministic factors of GI participation are gender,
   education level, and floor for private space, while only include
   building age for public space, in addition to the common factors of free
   time, cognition of GI, perception of pluvial flood risk, supportive
   factors, and environment-improving factors that can influence both
   private and public space GI participation. Our analysis therefore
   provides valuable information for policymakers concerning nature-based
   solutions to climate change adaptation and urban sustainability.},

Abstract = {Archaeological resources in the coastal zone are subjected to a variety
   of cultural, social, and environmental conditions that affect a site's
   stability, which can be defined in physical (e.g. structure, geophysical
   environment), sociocultural (e.g. looting, vandalism), and regulatory
   (e.g. federal, state, and local mandates) terms. To effectively manage
   resources within this dynamic environment requires a holistic
   understanding of what drives stability (or instability) at each site.
   The systematic development of indices for archaeological site stability
   aggregates a large number of complex conditions, both drivers and
   pressures, into a smaller set of key indicators that can be used to
   evaluate site stability, and to monitor changes over time. This system
   of indices provides an integrated framework for evaluation of
   site-specific stability that allows for adaptive management and the
   prioritisation of resources (e.g. funding, time, staff).},

   Adjacent Beaches along Western Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The compatibility of sediments in terms of grain size, composition and
   colour among beaches and strategic sediment deposits (SSD) along Western
   Sardinia (Western Mediterranean Sea) were assessed to explore management
   strategy in the protection and adaptation to counteract the beach
   erosion and the effect of sea level rise along sandy shores. Twelve
   beaches, mainly conditioned by geological control, due to the presence
   of extensive rocky outcrops in the sea, enclosed in seven sedimentary
   cells (defined by the continuity of sediment transport pathways and by
   identification of boundaries where there are discontinuities), were
   characterised in terms of sediment composition and grain size. One
   hundred ninety-three beach sediments and one hundred sediments from SSDs
   were collected and analysed for sediment grain size, carbonate content
   and sediment colour. The beach sediments are composed by gravel to fine
   sands (D-50: from 81 mu m to 4986 mu m) with siliciclastic and biogenic
   carbonate sediments mixed in different proportions (0-100\% in CaCO3).
   The SSDs sediments are gravels to medium-fine sand (D-50: from 96 mu m
   to 1769 mu m) composed by biogenic carbonate sands mixed with
   siliciclastic grains (0-100\% in CaCO3). To be able to evaluate the
   compatibility between the beaches and SSDs, a multivariate statistical
   procedure was applied to grain size dataset. Our results show that 8
   beaches have strategic deposits of compatible grain size and
   composition, whereas only 2 beaches have compatible strategic deposits
   of both grain size and colour. This may be related to the different
   sediment sources and depositional processes of sediment along the

Abstract = {Future changes in river discharge driven by climate change are expected
   to affect various water-resource sectors. In this study, we investigated
   the influence of climate change on streamflow in a heavy snowfall area
   of mountainous central Japan using hydrological model simulations driven
   by climate projections obtained from the d4PDF database. We projected an
   increase in snowmelt discharge during winter and a decrease in spring,
   along with a general decrease in water resources and an increase in the
   frequency of annual maximum daily discharge during winter because of
   increasing future snowmelt. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were then
   applied using atmospheric data to study the linkage between streamflow
   and weather regime patterns (WPs) in future and present climate
   scenarios. The SOM analysis suggested that the impacts of climate change
   on streamflow varied by WP. The increase in future winter discharge was
   due to the strengthening of impacts of certain WPs, causing snowmelt.
   However, the decrease during spring could be due to changes in the
   predominant discharge-related WPs resulting from a decreasing snowpack.
   The obtained results can be useful information for considering
   adaptation strategies for sustainable management of water resources in
   heavy snowfall areas that must meet both economic and environmental
   demands.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The aggravating impacts of the urban heat island phenomenon in
   Philippine cities has motivated planners to utilize urban green and blue
   spaces as a potential mitigation strategy. This study aims to assess the
   cooling effect (CE), heat reduction (HR), and energy saving potential
   (ESP) of trees and water along the Iloilo River Esplanade located in
   Iloilo City, Philippines. Microclimate modelling and simulation during
   summertime were performed using ENVI-met software and validated using
   field observations. Results of the study show that the urban park can
   provide a maximum CE of 2.63 degrees C at 3:00 PM near the southern edge
   of the river, which is equivalent to a HR of 13,564 J and an ESP of 1.09
   x 10(-2) kWh. Meanwhile, a temperature increase of up to 0.16 degrees C
   can be observed at night due to the nocturnal warming effect of water.
   In terms of spatial distribution, CE, HR, and ESP tend to gradually
   decrease as the horizontal distance from the park and altitude
   increases. Moreover, wind direction may also increase the scale and
   intensity of CE downwind, but it has an opposite effect in areas upwind.},

Title = {Combined Assessment of Climate Change and Socio-Economic Development as
   Drivers of Freshwater Availability in the South of Portugal},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {A combined assessment of the potential impacts from climate change (CC)
   and socio-economic development (SED) on water resources is presented for
   the most important aquifer in the south of Portugal. The goal is to
   understand how CC and SED affect the currently large pressures from
   water consuming and contaminating activities, predominantly agriculture.
   Short-term (2020-2050) and long-term (2070-2100) CC scenarios were
   developed and used to build aquifer recharge and crop water demand
   scenarios, using different methods to account for uncertainty. SED
   scenarios were developed using bottom-up and top-down methods, and
   discussed at workshops with farmers and institutional stakeholders in
   the water sector. Groundwater use was quantified for each scenario.
   Together with the recharge scenarios, these were run through a
   calibrated groundwater flow model, to study their individual and joint
   impacts on groundwater levels and discharge rates into a coastal
   estuary. Recharge scenarios show clear negative long-term trends and
   short-term increase in temporal variability of recharge, though
   short-term model uncertainties are higher. SED scenario 1 (SED1),
   predicting intensification and decline of small farms, considered the
   most likely by all workshop participants, shows a large drop in
   agricultural area and water demand. SED2, a most desired scenario by
   farmers, foresees growth and modernization of agriculture, but proves
   unsustainable in combination with predicted CC without efficient
   adaptation measures. The results thus reveal that CC in the region will
   dynamically interact with economic factors, and going one step beyond,
   CC could be directly integrated as a constraint in the development of
   SED scenarios. Exercises involving the integration of CC and SED
   regionally based scenarios, constructed in both bottom-up and top- down
   fashion and discussed in participatory contexts are still rarely used
   for adaptation, and specifically adaptation of agriculture to water
   scarcity. The joint analysis of CC and SED revealed challenging, as it
   involved the use of different methods across the border between natural
   and social sciences. In our view this method contributes in an
   encouraging manner to a more holistic and transdisciplinary water
   management, by allowing a more plausible identification of what (and if)
   adaptation measures are needed.},

Title = {Legal barriers and enablers for reintroducing tides: An Australian case
   study in reconverting ponded pasture for climate change mitigation},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {88},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Across the globe, areas of the floodplain have been converted to
   agricultural use - often at the expense of natural ecosystems. In
   Australia, coastal wetlands have been transformed to `ponded pasture'
   for cattle grazing which has resulted in a loss of saline wetlands,
   increased methane emissions, and impacts on species like fish and birds.
   Reconversion of these areas to saline wetlands is a potential climate
   change mitigation strategy, but given they occur at the intersection of
   private and public ownership regimes, some specific legal issues must be
   considered.
   This article provides an analysis of the legal enablers and barriers
   associated with reconverting ponded pastures or other hydrologically
   modified coastal land to saline wetlands for climate change mitigation,
   using Queensland, Australia as a case study. While projects are clearly
   possible, some of the key factors to consider in order to reduce legal
   risk and liability include: whether the law permits reflooding and what
   permits are required; clarifying land and carbon rights, which may
   require negotiation with the state government; and understanding the
   liabilities for potential impacts on adjacent land and biota.},

   Availability: Amino Acid Incorporation in San Francisco Bay},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Aquatic microorganisms are typically identified as either oligotrophic
   or copiotrophic, representing trophic strategies adapted to low or high
   nutrient concentrations, respectively. Here, we sought to take steps
   towards identifying these and additional adaptations to nutrient
   availability with a quantitative analysis of microbial resource use in
   mixed communities. We incubated an estuarine microbial community with
   stable isotope labeled amino acids (AAs) at concentrations spanning
   three orders of magnitude, followed by taxon-specific quantitation of
   isotopic incorporation using NanoSIMS analysis of high-density
   microarrays. The resulting data revealed that trophic response to AA
   availability falls along a continuum between copiotrophy and
   oligotrophy, and high and low activity. To illustrate strategies along
   this continuum more simply, we statistically categorized microbial taxa
   among three trophic types, based on their incorporation responses to
   increasing resource concentration. The data indicated that taxa with
   copiotrophic-like resource use were not necessarily the most active, and
   taxa with oligotrophic-like resource use were not always the least
   active. Two of the trophic strategies were not randomly distributed
   throughout a 16S rDNA phylogeny, suggesting they are under selective
   pressure in this ecosystem and that a link exists between evolutionary
   relatedness and substrate affinity. The diversity of strategies to adapt
   to differences in resource availability highlights the need to expand
   our understanding of microbial interactions with organic matter in order
   to better predict microbial responses to a changing environment.},

Title = {Towards an operationalisation of nature-based solutions for natural
   hazards},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {731},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) are being promoted as adaptive measures
   against predicted increasing hydrometeorological hazards (HMHs), such as
   heatwaves and floods which have already caused significant loss of life
   and economic damage across the globe. However, the underpinning factors
   such as policy framework, end-users' interests and participation for NBS
   design and operationalisation are yet to be established. We discuss the
   operationalisation and implementation processes of NBS by means of a
   novel concept of Open-Air Laboratories (OAL) for its wider acceptance.
   The design and implementation of environmentally, economically,
   technically and socio-culturally sustainable NBS require inter- and
   transdisciplinary approaches which could be achieved by fostering
   co-creation processes by engaging stakeholders across various sectors
   and levels, inspiring more effective use of skills, diverse knowledge,
   manpower and resources, and connecting and harmonising the adaptation
   aims. The OAL serves as a benchmark for NBS upscaling, replication and
   exploitation in policy-making process through monitoring by field
   measurement, evaluation by key performance indicators and building solid
   evidence on their short- and long-term multiple benefits in different
   climatic, environmental and socioeconomic conditions, thereby
   alleviating the challenges of political resistance, financial barriers
   and lack of knowledge. We conclude that holistic management of HMHs by
   effective use of NBS can be achieved with standard compliant data for
   replicating and monitoring NBS in OALs, knowledge about policy silos and
   interaction between research communities and end-users. Further research
   is needed for multi-risk analysis of HMHs and inclusion of NBS into
   policy frameworks, adaptable at local, regional and national scales
   leading to modification in the prevalent guidelines related to HMHs. The
   findings of this work can be used for developing synergies between
   current policy frameworks, scientific research and practical
   implementation of NBS in Europe and beyond for its wider acceptance. (C)

Abstract = {Heat waves are posing rising threats to the environment and society due
   to climate change, urban sprawl, and aging population. To help identify
   and reduce the vulnerability of cities to extreme heat, this study
   projects the spatial and temporal variation of heat waves in the
   twenty-first century and evaluates the performance and
   cost-effectiveness of heat wave mitigation strategies under future
   climate conditions. The heat-related condition of Washington D.C. is
   investigated for such purpose using the high-resolution weather research
   and forecasting model and the representative concentration pathway 8.5
   climate scenario. Results indicate that by the end of the century, the
   amplitude of heat waves may grow by 5.7 degrees C, and frequency and
   duration may increase by more than twofold. The urban heat island effect
   plays an important role in heat wave growth even though global climate
   change dominates the variation. Deploying cool roofs and green roofs in
   Washington D.C. can effectively reduce the amplitude and duration of
   heat waves, whereas using reflective pavements has relatively little
   impact. From an economic perspective, cool roofs are more cost-efficient
   than green roofs and reflective pavements.},

Title = {Evaluating adaptive co-management as conservation conflict resolution:
   Learning from seals and salmon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {160},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {By linking iterative learning and knowledge generation with
   power-sharing, adaptive co-management (ACM) provides a potential
   solution to resolving complex social-ecological problems. In this paper
   we evaluate ACM as a mechanism for resolving conservation conflict using
   a case study in Scotland, where seal and salmon fishery stakeholders
   have opposing and entrenched objectives. ACM emerged in 2002,
   successfully resolving this long-standing conflict. Applying evaluation
   approaches from the literature, in 2011 we interviewed stakeholders to
   characterise the evolution of ACM, and factors associated with its
   success over 10 years. In common with other ACM cases, triggers for the
   process were shifts in slow variables controlling the system (seal and
   salmon abundance, public perceptions of seal shooting), and exogenous
   shocks (changes in legal mandates, a seal disease outbreak). Also
   typical of ACM, three phases of evolution were evident: emerging local
   leadership preparing the system for change, a policy window of
   opportunity, and stakeholder partnerships building the resilience of the
   system. Parameters maintaining ACM were legal mechanisms and structures,
   legal power held by government, and the willingness of all stakeholders
   to reach a compromise and experiment with an alternative governance
   approach. Results highlighted the critical role of government power and
   support in resolving conservation conflict, which may constrain the
   extent of local stakeholder-driven ACM. The evaluation also demonstrated
   how, following perceived success, the trajectory of ACM has shifted to a
   `stakeholder apathy' phase, with declining leadership, knowledge
   exchange, stakeholder engagement, and system resilience. We discuss
   remedial actions required to revive the process, and the importance of
   long term government resourcing and alternative financing schemes for
   successful conflict resolution. Based on the results we present a
   generic indicator framework and participatory method for the
   longitudinal evaluation of ACM applied to conservation conflict
   resolution. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Salt marshes are at risk globally if they cannot keep pace with sea
   level rise. Along the United States Mid-Atlantic coast, high marsh has
   already declined, and is particularly vulnerable to future loss due to
   greater regional rates of relative sea level rise and limited capacity
   for both vertical accretion and landward migration. To support climate
   adaptation efforts in the region, we conducted a spatial overlay
   analysis to (1) assess interior ponding in the high tidal marsh zone
   caused by waterlogging, and (2) identify restoration opportunities where
   poor drainage is limiting natural recovery. Surface inundation has
   increased across over 14,000 ha of high marsh in the region, mostly
   along the eastern Chesapeake Bay and New Jersey coast. Within this
   waterlogged area, we identified 239 potential restoration sites (275
   ha). Validation data indicate our analysis had relatively high accuracy
   in identifying potential restoration sites, with a true positive rate of
   76\% and a true negative rate of 96\%. Widespread waterlogging
   emphasizes the need for climate adaptation efforts to restore and
   protect high marsh in the face of future change. Our recommended
   restoration strategy of connecting waterlogged sites to tidal creeks
   aligns with best practices by enabling drainage of high marsh to halt or
   even reverse ponding, improve recovery from future flooding events, and
   ultimately facilitate marsh migration with sea level rise.},

Title = {A Methodological Approach to Determine Sound Response Modalities to
   Coastal Erosion Processes in Mediterranean Andalusia (Spain)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Human occupation along coastal areas has been greatly increasing in
   recent decades and, in many places, human activities and infrastructures
   are threatened by erosion processes that can produce relevant economic
   and human losses. In order to reduce such impacts and design sound
   management strategies, which can range from the ``no action{''} to the
   ``protection{''} option, coastal managers need to know the intrinsic
   coastal sensitivity and the potential vulnerability and value of land
   uses. In this paper, in a first step, coastal sensitivity was determined
   by calculating the following: (i) the spatial distribution at the coast
   of the wave forcing obtained by using the ERA5 wave dataset and defined
   as the energy associated with the 50-year return period storm. Two storm
   conditions were considered, that is, one for the eastern and one for the
   western parts of the Andalusia Mediterranean coast, respectively,
   characterized by a height of 8.64-7.86 m and 4.85-4.68 m and (ii) the
   existence of a buffer zone, namely the dry beach width expressed as a
   multiple of the 20-year predicted shoreline position that was calculated
   using a dataset of aerial photographs covering a time span from 1956 to
   2016. Coastal sensitivity values were divided into five classes with
   class 1 indicating the lowest sensitivity (i.e., the presence of a wide
   buffer zone associated with low wave energy flux values) and class 5 the
   highest sensitivity (i.e., a narrow buffer zone associated with very
   high wave energy flux values). In a second step, land uses were obtained
   from the official Land Use Map of the Andalusia Region, based on the
   results of the ``Coordination of Information on the Environment{''}
   (CORINE) European Project. Such uses were divided into five classes from
   class 1 including natural areas (typologies ``A{''} and ``B{''} of the
   CORINE Project) to class 5 including very capital land uses (typologies
   ``E1{''} and ``E2{''}). In a third step, information concerning coastal
   sensitivity and land uses was crossed to determine the best mitigation
   strategies to cope with erosion processes. The ``no action{''} option
   was observed at the westernmost area of Cadiz Province and at some areas
   from the west coast of Almeria Province, where both coastal sensitivity
   and land use classes show low values; the ``adaptation{''} option was
   recorded along more than one half of the coast studied, essentially at
   natural areas with high sensitivity and at urbanized areas with low
   sensitivity; and the ``protection{''} option was observed especially at
   some areas from the center and eastern part of Malaga Province and at
   the easternmost areas of Almeria Province, where both coastal
   sensitivity and land use classes presented high values.},

   participant observation, and interviews with tribal leaders, fishermen,
   trappers, as well as scientists and local politicians. In order to grasp
   the emic perspective, most interviews were conducted in the Houma French
   dialect.
   Findings - The Mississippi Delta epitomizes issues that will shape
   tomorrow's world, namely, the vulnerability of coastal areas and the
   flows of environmental refugees. As shown by this study, coastal
   residents do not make a passive flux of evacuees responding to
   state/NGO-run plans. Actually, they are chief agents who either develop
   resilient strategies or proactive relocation stratagems to avoid
   ethnocide. Their pragmatic methodologies provide valuable data for any
   crisis management efforts.
   Originality/value - This research gives a voice to the voiceless, and
   conveys their existential struggles from within - unlike most studies of
   endangered communities relying on outsiders' viewpoints. This
   perspective depicts the Houmas as actors of their survival who implement
   diverse tribal strategies for coping with environmental change.},

Abstract = {Many aquatic species are linked to environmental drivers such as
   temperature and salinity through processes such as spawning, recruitment
   and growth. Information is needed on how fished species may respond to
   altered environmental drivers under climate change so that adaptive
   management strategies can be developed. Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is
   a highly prized species of the Indo-West Pacific, whose recruitment and
   growth is driven by river discharge. We developed a monthly age-and
   length-structured population model for barramundi. Monte Carlo Markov
   Chain simulations were used to explore the population's response to
   altered river discharges under modelled total licenced water abstraction
   and projected climate change, derived and downscaled from Global Climate
   Model A1FI. Mean values of exploitable biomass, annual catch, maximum
   sustainable yield and spawning stock size were significantly reduced
   under scenarios where river discharge was reduced; despite including
   uncertainty. These results suggest that the upstream use of water
   resources and climate change have potential to significantly reduce
   downstream barramundi stock sizes and harvests and may undermine the
   inherent resilience of estuarine-dependent fisheries.},

Abstract = {The current discussion of anticipated climate change impacts and future
   sea level rise is particularly relevant to small island states. An
   increase in natural hazards, such as floods and storm waves, is likely
   to have a devastating impact on small islands' coastlines, severely
   affecting targeted sustainable development. Coastal erosion, notably
   human-induced erosion, has been an ongoing threat to small island
   biodiversity, resources, infrastructure, and settlements, as well as
   society at large. In the context of climate change, the problem of
   coastal erosion and the debate surrounding it is gaining momentum.
   Before attributing associated impacts to climate change, current human
   activities need to be analysed, focusing not only on geomorphological
   and climatological aspects, but also on political and traditional
   cultural frameworks. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the
   importance of the social-political-ecological systems analysis for
   adaptation strategies, and thus for future sustainable development.
   Coastal use is based on human constructs of the coast, as well as local
   perceptions and values ascribed to the coast. We use the case study of
   Anjouan, Comoros to differentiate between constructive and destructive
   practices on the coast, from both a mental and technical perspective.
   Beach erosion is described as more than a resource problem that
   manifests itself locally rather than nationally. Divergent political
   scales of interest impact future development as much as local action.
   Local action is not least framed by mental contribution and attribution
   of coasts as places for living, recreation and resource use. The present
   case study demonstrates that mental constructs of coasts as valuable
   areas can, in some cases, lead to the protection and preservation of
   beaches by initiatives of collective action. At the same time, local
   communities see the negative impacts of sand mining as causes of coastal
   erosion and, therefore, it is difficult to mobilize them to adapt to
   climate change and sea level rise.},

Abstract = {The impacts of anthropogenic climate change will be most dramatic for
   species that live in narrow thermal niches, such as reptiles. Given the
   imminent threat to biodiversity, and that actions to reduce carbon
   emissions are not yet sufficient, it is important that a sound evidence
   base of potential mitigation options is available for conservation
   managers.
   Successful incubation and production of male sea turtle hatchlings is
   threatened by increased global temperatures (sex is determined by the
   temperature at which eggs incubate). Here we test two conservation tools
   to reduce incubation temperatures: clutch splitting and clutch shading,
   on a nesting loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta population in the Eastern
   Atlantic Ocean.
   During the thermosensitive period of incubation, split and shaded
   clutches were both 1.00 degrees C cooler than control nests. Clutch
   splitting (mean: 45 eggs) reduced nest temperatures by reducing
   metabolic heating during incubation compared to controls (mean: 92
   eggs). Modelled primary sex ratios differed between nest treatments,
   with 1.50\% (+/- 6\% SE) females produced in shaded nests, 45.00\% (+/-
   7\% SE) females in split nests and 69.00\% (+/- 6\% SE) females in
   controls. Neither treatment affected hatchling size, success, mass or
   vigour. When clutch splitting was repeated 2 years later, hatch success
   was higher in split clutches compared to controls.
   Synthesis and applications. Clutch splitting and clutch shading
   successfully altered the thermal profile of incubating turtle nests.
   When there is sufficient knowledge to better understand the effects of
   intervention on fundamental population demographics, they will be useful
   for reducing incubation temperatures in sea turtle nests, potentially
   increasing nest survival and male hatchling production. The effect of
   clutch splitting in reducing nest temperature was lower relative to
   clutch shading, but requires significantly less funding, materials and
   specialist skill, key factors for management of turtle rookeries that
   are often in remote, resource-limited areas.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examined the potential impacts of predicted climatic
   changes on the flora and vegetation in Denmark using data from a digital
   database on the natural vegetation of Europe. Climate scenarios A2 and
   B2 were used to find regions with present climatic conditions similar to
   Denmark's climate in the year 2100. The potential natural vegetation of
   Denmark today is predominantly deciduous forest that would cover more
   than 90\% of the landscape. Swamps, bogs, and wet forest would be found
   under moist or wet conditions. Dwarf shrub heaths would be naturally
   occurring on poor soils along the coast together with dune systems and
   salt-marsh vegetation. When comparing the natural vegetation of Denmark
   to the vegetation of five future-climate analogue areas, the most
   obvious trend is a shift from deciduous to thermophilous broadleaved
   forest currently found in Southern and Eastern Europe. A total of 983
   taxa were recorded for this study of which 539 were found in Denmark.
   The Sorensen index was used to measure the floristic similarity between
   Denmark and the five subregions. Deciduous forest, dwarf shrub heath,
   and coastal vegetation were treated in more detail, focusing on
   potential new immigrant species to Denmark. Finally, implications for
   management were discussed. The floristic similarity between Denmark and
   regions in Europe with a climate similar to what is expected for Denmark
   in year 2100 was found to vary between 48-78\%, decreasing from North to
   South. Hence, it seems inevitable that climate changes of the magnitudes
   foreseen will alter the distribution of individual species and the
   composition of natural vegetation units. Changes, however, will not be
   immediate. Historic evidence shows a considerable lag in response to
   climatic change under natural conditions, but little is known about the
   effects of human land-use and pollution on this process. Facing such
   uncertainties we suggested that a dynamic strategy based on modeling,
   monitoring and adaptive management is adopted. Modeling techniques can
   be constantly improved, but will never be perfect and should therefore
   be linked to a fine-masked network of observatories to check model
   predictions and feed empirical data back into the models for calibration
   and further development.},

Title = {The impact of regulatory obligations on fishers' income: Identifying

Abstract = {Profit is an important driver of fishers' behaviour. Thus, identifying
   fishers' regulatory preferences in economic terms can assist the
   creation of more acceptable, workable and sustainable policies. The
   Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) method was adapted from its original
   application as a marketing tool to identify fishers' most and least
   preferred regulatory obligations in terms of the impact these
   obligations have on their income. Significant differences were
   identified in fishers' preferences that depended on the regulatory
   measures fishers operated under at the time of the study (which related
   to the fishery and the region in which the fishers belonged). All
   fishers agreed that access to resources, i.e. how much access they have
   within a certain sea area was most important for their income. However,
   there were differences in fishers' preferences with regards to the
   majority of regulatory measures: inshore fishers preferred restrictions
   related to the category `Days at Sea' rather than `Total Allowable
   Catches', and vice versa for offshore fishers. Fishers' preferences
   varied most for `Enforcement and Compliance' related obligations with
   the general trend being that fishers tend to prefer the measure with
   which they are most accustomed. This paper emphasises the need for
   additional knowledge at a more localised level on fishers' regulatory
   perceptions. Such knowledge will allow regulators to account for
   fishers' perceptions and attitudes towards regulatory measures when
   formulating legislation. Accounting for perceptions and attitudes of the
   relevant stakeholders will assist the successful implementation of new
   measures by providing relevant incentives and mitigation measures. (C)

   large-sized dinoflagellates (i.e., S-species, K-strategists). Community
   changes were related to different scales of meteorological and
   hydrographic variability. At the seasonal scale, the succession from
   r-strategists towards K-strategists, or from C- and/or R-species towards
   S-species, was related with the annual cycle of mixing/stratification
   and high/low flushing. Within this seasonal pattern, a series of
   short-term `successions' were identified, the onset of which co-occurred
   with hydrodynamic changes induced by meteorological disturbances. These
   results support the conclusions articulated in a previous paper on
   microplankton community structure during 1991 concerning: (1) the
   relative persistence of characteristic microplankton assemblages and
   their ecological interpretation in terms of adaptive strategies, and (2)
   the key role of weather-induced, hydrodynamic variability, especially at
   short-term scales, in shaping the structure of the community. The
   contrasting meteorology in 1987 and 1991 would explain interannual
   differences of community structure, such as the larger proportion of
   diatoms in 1991 than in 1987 due to increased intensity and duration of
   the upwelling seasonal cycle that year. At the species level, the early
   phase of the seasonal succession was characterised by the coexistence
   (i.e., single-species biomass, B(i)<= 40\%: of total biomass) or
   alternating dominance (Bi > 40\% B(T)) among (C-R) species, while the
   late part was characterised by the alternating dominance among species
   with different adaptive strategies. For instance, in September-October,
   the short-term succession started with the dominance of the (C-R)
   species Leptocylindrus danicus (similar to 80\% of B(T), during 3
   weeks), followed by the (S-R) species Ceratium fusus + Ceratium Jurca
   (similar to 70\% of B(T), 1 week), and finished with the dominance of
   small microheterotrophs (similar to 70\% of B(T), 2 weeks).(c) 2004

Title = {Flood warnings in coastal areas: how do experience and information
   influence responses to alert services?},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {703-714},
Abstract = {Many studies discuss the economic and technical aspects of flood
   warnings. Less attention has been given to the social and behavioural
   patterns that affect alert services. In particular, the literature
   focuses on warnings activated in river basins or marine environments
   without providing clear evidence on Mediterranean coastal areas, even
   though these are subjected to growing flood risk related to climate
   change. This paper is a first attempt to bridge this gap. Our research
   develops an in-depth analysis of the village of Cesenatico on the
   Adriatic Sea coast. Here the municipality adopted two complementary
   warning systems: a siren and an alert via short message service (SMS).
   The analysis focuses on a survey conducted in 2011 and 2012 with 228
   participants. The relationships between social and behavioural variables
   and warning services are investigated as well as flood preparedness and
   information dissemination. Qualitative evidence from informal interviews
   is used to support the understanding of key responses. The conclusions
   show how different social and behavioural patterns can influence the
   effectiveness and use of warning systems, regardless of the technology
   adopted and the structural mitigation measures implemented. Education,
   training and accountability are seen to be critical elements for
   implementation. Finally, the statistical output is used to suggest new
   questions and new directions for research.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {White Shark watching tourism at natural aggregation sites is an
   increasingly popular activity globally among marine wildlife
   enthusiasts. This wildlife tourism activity promotes conservation and
   economic development but information on the design of adequate and
   sustainable management practices is missing. Management of the White
   Shark Observation Activity (WSOA) at Guadalupe Island, Mexico, in an
   international context was explored. The actors involved in the WSOA as
   well as the power relationships among them were investigated. Actors
   helped to elucidate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
   of the WSOA. Tourist Operators, Tourists, a Fishing Cooperative,
   Non-Governmental Organizations, Academia, and Federal Government
   institutions were identified as the main groups of actors. All the
   actors agreed that they have an interest in the use of resources and
   their conservation but their needs and some perspectives of management
   differed. An imbalance of power among actors was found, with Federal
   Governmental institutions holding most power, possibly hindering
   collective management actions. It is necessary to adapt a management
   plan that promotes a vision for the future and the integration of the
   concerns and perspectives of the stakeholders to ensure the
   sustainability of the WSOA.},

Title = {Application of Social Vulnerability Indicators to Climate Change for the
   Southwest Coastal Areas of Taiwan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impact of climate change on the coastal zones of Taiwan not only
   affects the marine environment, ecology, and human communities whose
   economies rely heavily on marine activities, but also the sustainable
   development of national economics. The southwest coast is known as the
   area most vulnerable to climate change; therefore, this study aims to
   develop indicators to assess social vulnerability in this area of Taiwan
   using the three dimensions of susceptibility, resistance, and
   resilience. The modified Delphi method was used to develop nine criteria
   and 26 indexes in the evaluation, and the analytic hierarchy process
   method was employed to evaluate the weight of each indicator based on
   the perspectives of experts collected through questionnaire surveys. The
   results provide important information pertaining to the vulnerability of
   the most susceptive regions, the lowest-resistance areas, and the least
   resilient townships on the southwest coast. The most socially vulnerable
   areas are plotted based on the present analysis. Experts can consider
   the vulnerability map provided here when developing adaptation policies.
   It should be kept in mind that improving the capacities of resistance
   and resilience is more important than reducing susceptibility in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {Plants have followed two principal (and contrasting) strategies of
   adaptation to the irregular supply of water on land, which are closely
   bound up with scale. Vascular plants evolved internal transport from the
   soil to the leafy canopy (but their `homoihydry' is far from absolute,
   and some are desiccation tolerant (DT)). Bryophytes depended on
   desiccation tolerance, suspending metabolism when water was not
   available; their cells are generally either fully turgid or desiccated.
   Desiccation tolerance requires preservation intact through
   drying-re-wetting cycles of essential cell components and their
   functional relationships, and controlled cessation and restarting of
   metabolism. In many bryophytes and some vascular plants tolerance is
   essentially constitutive. In other vascular plants (particularly
   poikilochlorophyllous species) and some bryophytes tolerance is induced
   by water stress. Desiccation tolerance is adaptively optimal on hard
   substrates impenetrable to roots, and on poor dry soils in seasonally
   dry climates. DT vascular plants are commonest in warm semiarid
   climates; DT mosses and lichens occur from tropical to polar regions. DT
   plants vary widely in their inertia to changing water content. Some
   mosses and lichens dry out and recover within an hour or less; vascular
   species typically respond on a time scale of one to a few days. (C) New

Title = {Navigating risks and uncertainties: Risk perceptions and risk management
   strategies in the Philippine seaweed industry},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Philippine seaweed industry is affected by multiple but interrelated
   risks. Farmers mainly encountered environment-related risks (e.g.
   disease, pest infestations) which, if unmanaged, could result to
   production failure. Traders and processors considered volatility of
   seaweed supply and poor quality of raw materials as precursors of other
   risks such as increased competition among local traders and processing
   companies. Gender differences in awareness and knowledge of risks were
   more prominent among seaweed farmers but not among traders and
   processors as roles become more homogenous up the value chain. Poor
   governance resulted in the adoption of informal and market-driven
   strategies to prevent or minimise losses. However, this restricted
   farmers to participating in higher-income trading and processing
   activities and contributed to increased market inefficiency. The lack of
   government support has also curtailed the capacity of traders and
   processors to engage in product development and diversification. Gender
   and community experiences influence and shape people?s understanding of
   their situations and environment including their coping and adaptive
   strategies in sustaining livelihoods amidst recurring risk events.
   Embedding informal structures and the differential needs of the
   stakeholders in the national institutional framework is therefore
   essential for the promotion of resilient and sustainable seaweed
   industry.},

   process to recognize prior learning acquired during informal workshops.
   The project focused on how to assess the acquired skills and credit the
   learners to then complete a resilience qualification. Recognition of
   Prior Learning (RPL) creates opportunities for people who acquired
   skills during informal workshops or through their personal experience
   and provides them with credits for a qualification. As a result, it
   increases their employability, assists in the diversification of their
   source of income and supports the professionalization of the resilience
   sector in the Pacific. One major challenge for RPL is the need to build
   the trust of practitioners and potential employers for the process.
   Another challenge is to develop fair and robust assessment practices for
   resilience which is a broad, cross-cutting sector, where skills cannot
   be directly demonstrated during an assessment session.},

Abstract = {Climate sensitivity and climate-carbon cycle feedbacks interact to
   determine how global carbon and energy cycles will change in the future.
   While the science of these connections is well documented, their
   economic implications are not well understood. Here we examine the
   effect of climate change on the carbon cycle, the uncertainty in climate
   outcomes inherent in any given policy target, and the economic
   implications. We examine three policy scenarios-a no policy
   ``Reference{''} (REF) scenario, and two policies that limit total
   radiative forcing-with four climate sensitivities using a coupled
   integrated assessment model. Like previous work, we find that, within a
   given scenario, there is a wide range of temperature change and sea
   level rise depending on the realized climate sensitivity. We expand on
   this previous work to show that temperature-related feedbacks on the
   carbon cycle result in more mitigation required as climate sensitivity
   increases. Thus, achieving a particular radiative forcing target becomes
   increasingly expensive as climate sensitivity increases.},

Title = {A Review on the Water Dimensions, Security, and Governance for Two
   Distinct Regions},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Non-arid region countries, including Canada, enjoy abundant water
   resources, while arid countries such as Qatar struggle to meet their
   water needs. However, climate change threats to water resources are
   similar for both climatic regions. Therefore, this article discusses
   water dimensions, security, and governance for these different regions,
   i.e., non-arid Canada and arid Qatar, that distinctly respond to their
   water-related challenges. Limitations of the article include lesser
   water-related literature availability for Qatar than for Canada.
   Canada's water resources appear vulnerable to climate change as it is
   projected to face >0.6 degrees C above the global average of 1.6 degrees
   C for the 20th-century temperature. Qatar is extremely vulnerable to
   dust storms, and rising sea levels, with the maximum temperature
   approaching 50 degrees C during the summer, and flooding during the
   winter. The sustainable use of water resources needs to address social,
   economic, political, climate change, and environmental dimensions of
   water. Other than climate change impacts and high per capita consumption
   of water, Qatar faces challenges of a rise in population (similar to 29
   million as of now), acute shortage of freshwater from rainfall (similar
   to 80 mm per annum), high evapotranspiration (similar to 95\% of the
   total rainfall), depletion of groundwater, and low agricultural
   productivity due to infertile lands and water scarcity, all leading to
   food insecurity. The sustainable use of water resources requires
   improved regulations for water governance and management. Comparisons of
   water sustainability issues, dimensions, security, and governance
   facilitate discussions to improve water governance structures for
   resource sustainability, food security, and climate change adaptability,
   and show how one country could learn from the experiences of the other.},

   Coastal Symposium), 1896 - 1900. Szczecin, Poland, ISBN 0749-0208
   This work illustrates the methodology developed to evaluate the risk of
   coastal flooding and its application to Vale do Lobo beach, located in
   the Loule Municipality, a Portuguese coastal area under significant
   touristic pressure. The methodology is based on six main steps: 1)
   division of the study area into sub-areas with similar characteristics
   in terms of coastal defense; 2) determining the probability of exceeding
   the pre-set thresholds of flood levels for each study area; 3)
   establishment of qualitative factors related to the consequences of such
   excess of the flood levels; 4) the combination of the above steps for
   expeditious assessment of flood risks; 5) identification of the risk
   areas; 6) proposal for risk adaptation. The determination of the flood
   levels is based on the local wave regime at the Faro wave-buoy over 9
   years, on its propagation to the study area using the SWAN model
   integrated in the geographic information system (GIS), GUIOMAR, together
   with the calculation of run-up and flooding levels based on empirical
   formulae. Special emphasis is placed on the automation of this process
   in GUIOMAR to make it an efficient tool for risk assessment. To
   determine the risk of coastal flooding, a methodology has been developed
   using the geographic information system and a multi-criteria analysis to
   assess the vulnerability of the territory in several episodes of
   flooding and to determine the different risk areas.},

Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {47-59},

Abstract = {It is widely agreed that small island developing states (SIDS), a
   distinct group of 58 developing countries, are uniquely vulnerable to
   the impacts of climate change. Many SIDS recognize that adequate and
   effective adaptation to climate change are important components of
   sustainable development and, as such, are pursuing climate change
   adaptation policies and programs at the national level. Chapter 29
   (Small Islands) of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change suggests that more needs to be learnt about how
   climate change mainstreaming can be practically achieved in these
   countries. Working within a resilience framework and interviewing senior
   government and regional organization officials from Caribbean and
   Pacific SIDS, this paper aims to understand the drivers of, and barriers
   to adaptation mainstreaming at the national level. In doing this, it
   finds multiple drivers - the three most commonly reported are
   institutional/organizational, `champions'/personalities/informal
   networks and risk and exposure. It also finds multiple barriers - the
   three most commonly reported are competing development priorities, poor
   planning/governance and insufficient manpower/human resources. Building
   on this knowledge, this paper then proposes a seven-step process towards
   practically achieving mainstreaming in SIDS, which can be used by
   national governments and regional organizations to guide their actions
   in this regard.},

Abstract = {China's coastal region is physically and socio-economically vulnerable
   to accelerated sea-level rise and associated coastal flooding because of
   its low topography, highly developed economy and highly-dense
   population. In this study, we present a scenario of sea level rise and
   storm surge flooding along the China's coastal region over the next
   century and apply them to a digital elevation model (DEM) which acquired
   by the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) to illustrate the extent
   and spatial distribution to which coastal areas are susceptible to
   permanent inundation and episodic flooding due to storm events. To
   perform flood scenario analysis and vulnerability assessment, a method
   for producing several sets of data was implemented by combining remote
   sensing processing, the use of grid-based socioeconomic data, and
   subsequent analysis using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This
   analysis shows that inundation and coastal flooding will mainly occur in
   the major delta without the protection of dike systems. However, due to
   the concentration of population and economic activities in China's
   coastal region, societal and economic consequences of continued
   sea-level rise would be substantial. Finally, some suggestions are
   presented for decision-makers, and other concerned stakeholders to
   develop appropriate public policies and mitigation measures.},

Title = {Morphodynamics of deltaic wetlands and implications for coastal
   ecosystems - A case study of Save River Delta, Mozambique},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {322},
Pages = {107-116},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Deltaic wetlands experience changes over time, with substantial impacts
   on the coastal ecosystems. These changes, whether they are natural or
   human-induced, are caused by multiple factors through complex links and
   interdependences, and constitute challenges for coastal management
   aiming to set up practical adaptation measures. In this study, we
   investigate a case study of Save River Delta to interpret the typical
   morphodynamic pattern on the deltaic plain over an interdecadal
   timescale and the implications of geomorphological changes for the
   coastal ecosystems, with emphasis on mangroves. Our results reveal the
   pattern of the geomorphological changes on the deltaic wetland in river
   and back-barrier sectors. In both sectors, erosion and accretion are
   mutually adjusting processes, and they result in geomorphological
   settings characterized by a distinctive interaction with the ecosystem;
   on the one hand, mangrove trees colonize new favorable settings; on the
   other hand, the existing mangrove trees undergo degradation related to
   the morphodynamic processes. Notwithstanding current episodic events
   that affect the deltaic wetlands (e.g. cyclones and floods), the changes
   observed in the study area are part of interdecadal timescale
   morphodynamics. These changes were consistent for the 50-year time
   period analyzed. If, on the one hand, some of the episodic and high
   magnitude weather events such as floods undermine the status of the
   deltaic ecosystem, on the other hand these events contribute to develop
   the same ecosystem over a longer timescale. Within interdecadal
   timescales, biogeomorphological changes in deltaic wetlands are a
   critical reference frame for understanding future scenarios of
   environmental changes caused by climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Evolutionary explanations for social phenomena are increasingly common
   in sociology and anthropology circles. The intersection where cultural
   change, human behavioral variation and adaptation research meet is
   complex and frequently subject to distortion or misunderstanding. In the
   popular press, Arctic populations in particular are often portrayed as
   cultures in crisis, unable to cope in the face of climate change. This
   study assesses the claim that there is a fundamental mismatch, or
   disequilibrium, between Arctic peoples and their environment. Utilizing
   ethnographic interviews with contemporary hunters and fishers from Disko
   Bay in northwest Greenland alongside archival Greenlandic Statbank data
   and peer-reviewed literature, we provide an overview of
   population-culture-environment interactions over time. The data confirm
   an environment that is constantly in flux, with corresponding human
   population boom and bust. However, humans are not passive receivers of
   this change nor are they blindly reacting to disequilibrium. Instead
   coping strategies are afforded by constantly shifting use of
   sociocultural knowledge, behavioural flexibility and a creative use of
   technological buffers. The extent of indigenous people's ability to
   incorporate long-term on-going environmental perturbations, particularly
   in the context of global patterns of trade and industry, remains an open
   discussion.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},

Pages = {97-105},
Abstract = {Effects of coastal ocean acidification, other than calcification, were
   tested on juvenile clams Ruditapes decussatus during a controlled CO2
   perturbation experiment. The carbonate chemistry of natural (control)
   seawater was manipulated by injecting CO2 to attain 2 reduced pH levels
   (-0.4 and -0.7 pH units) as compared with the control seawater. After 87
   d of exposure, we found that the acidification conditions tested in this
   experiment significantly reduced the clearance, ingestion and
   respiration rates, and increased the ammonia excretion rate of R.
   decussatus seeds. Reduced ingestion combined with increased excretion is
   generally associated with a reduced energy input, which will likely
   contribute to a slower growth of the clams in a future high CO2 coastal
   ocean. These results emphasize the need for management policies to
   mitigate the adverse effects of global change on aquaculture, which is
   an economically relevant activity in most coastal areas worldwide.},

Title = {Using bio-oils for improving environmental performance of an advanced
   resinous binder for pavement applications with heat and noise island
   mitigation potential},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urbanization and actions are responsible for overheated cities compared
   to the adjacent rural settings, a phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island
   (UHI). Additionally, conventional urban materials contribute towards the
   aggravation of urban noise pollution, a phenomenon that may be described
   as Urban Noise Island (UNI). Numerous solutions have been proposed
   through the implementation of novel, more sustainable, or natural
   materials in the pavement infrastructure. To that end, this study
   bridges the gap between UHI and UNI mitigation strategies,
   simultaneously ensuring low environmental impact. Therefore, a
   resin-based pavement binder was investigated through multiphysics
   analysis, together with four innovative binders made with waste
   bio-oils. Thermal, optical, acoustical and Life Cycle Assessment
   analysis were carried out for gauging the UHI/UNI mitigation potential
   of binders and their environmental impact. Results showed that the
   innovative binders preserved good physical properties: all binders have
   solar reflectance higher than 50\% within 750-1600 nm range and sound
   absorption coefficient higher than 0.8 within 600-800 Hz. Additionally,
   bio-oils decreased the environmental impact of the binder up to
   37.46mPt, and 8.33\% in the ReCiPe, and Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change analysis, respectively. Therefore, the exploitation of
   bio-oils in the pavement market can be considered as promising green
   solution for mitigating both UHI and UNI.},

   principles to guide conceptual design. We illustrate this method with an
   example of the design of a variable stiffness skin for a morphable

   increased levels of knowledge and commitment to active involvement in
   sustainability and climate change issues. Common threads came together
   in a coherent set of recommendations that will contribute to ongoing
   climate change and sustainability planning by the Rottnest Island
   Authority. Major conclusions drawn include: the usefulness of Google
   Earth for participatory planning for climate adaptation and
   sustainability; the methodology enables social, economic, ecological and
   cultural layers to be considered without any having primacy; care must
   be taken to ensure knowledge and power differential are managed

Title = {Habitat drivers of endangered rorqual whales in a highly impacted
   upwelling region},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {610-616},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Recent studies show that human impacts on marine ecosystems are
   threatening marine biodiversity. A greater emphasis on predicting how
   predators might respond to changes in the marine environment is needed
   because the effects of human activities are spatially heterogeneous.
   Here we analyse rorqual whales distribution data in a highly impacted
   upwelling region (North-western Iberian coast, Spain). Using a
   multi-model inference approach this study assesses the habitat drivers
   of the fine-scale distribution of three endangered whale species (blue,
   fin and sei whales) as a way to better understand how rorqual whales
   might respond to human-induced changes in the coastal ecosystem. The
   unequal use of available habitat, concentrated at the edge of the
   continental slope (200 m depth and strong bottom slope gradient) in
   areas with a south-easterly coastal orientation, showed that rorqual
   whales presented a fine-scale pattern of habitat selection in response
   to prey availability. Rorqual whales' distribution is affected by the
   coastal upwelling regime of the Iberian Peninsula, which is known to be
   under impact of climate change. Therefore, responses of rorqual whales
   to upwelling changes might be manifested at the population level such as
   shifts in abundance and distribution. This information contributes to
   extend the scant information available about the presence of these
   species in the North-east Atlantic. Our findings provide management
   agencies with an opportunity to devise and implement adequate adaptation
   measures which may ameliorate adverse effects critical for the
   conservation of rorquals in a changing climate.},

Title = {Warming up, turning sour, losing breath: ocean biogeochemistry under

Abstract = {In the coming decades and centuries, the ocean's biogeochemical cycles
   and ecosystems will become increasingly stressed by at least three
   independent factors. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean
   deoxygenation will cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical
   and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean's
   biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning
   to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and
   biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also increase upper ocean
   stratification. The changes in the ocean's carbonate chemistry induced
   by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e. ocean
   acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes,
   although in ways that are currently not well understood. Ocean
   deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen (O-2) from the ocean,
   is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress
   to macro-organisms that critically depend on sufficient levels of
   oxygen. These three stressors-warming, acidification and
   deoxygenation-will tend to operate globally, although with distinct
   regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be
   strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the
   low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific
   regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be
   strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots
   for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean
   acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the organic
   matter exported to the ocean's interior, which then might cause
   substantial changes in the oxygen concentration there. Ocean warming,
   acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on
   centennial time scales, i.e. once these changes have occurred, it will
   take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of CO2 being
   the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation
   strategy is to reduce these emissions.},

Title = {Efficacy of Possible Strategies to Mitigate the Urban Heat Island Based
   on Urbanized High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (u-HRLDAS)},

Abstract = {Summer heat waves are a significant public health threat in China. This
   paper took Wuhan (one of the four hottest furnace cities in China) as an
   example to explore several strategies for mitigating the surface urban
   heat island (UHI), measured by the land surface temperature, including
   green roofs, cool roofs, bright pavements, and altered urban building
   patterns. The offline urbanized High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation
   System (u-HRLDAS) was used to conduct 1-km resolution numerical
   simulations, which also accounts for the effects of Wuhan's abundant
   lakes on UHI evolution, with a dynamic lake model. The diurnal cycle and
   spatial distribution of simulated UHI were analyzed under different
   mitigation strategies. Results show that considering lake effects
   reduces daytime (nighttime) UHI intensity by about 1.0 K (0.5 K). Green
   roofs and cool roofs are more effective in mitigating daytime UHI than
   bright pavements. The maximum UHI reduction is about 2.1 K at 13:00
   local time by replacing 80 \% of conventional roofs with green roofs.
   The UHI mitigation efficiency increases with larger fractions of green
   roofs, and increased albedo of roofs and roads. In contrast to green
   roofs, cool roofs and bright pavements are ineffective during nighttime,
   changing the urban building pattern to mitigate UHL is effective
   throughout the day. ``Height-driven building structure changing{''}
   (raising the building height while changing the fraction of impervious
   surface in each grid to keep the total building volume intact) can
   reduce surface UHF intensity by 0.4-0.9 K, and ``density-driven building
   structure changing{''} (distributing building density uniformly and
   modifying the building height to make the total building volume
   unchanged) reduces UHI by 1.2-2.6 K. These results showed new insights
   in mitigating UHIs for mega cities, like Wuhan, and provides a practical
   guideline for policymakers to offer more habitable cities.},

Title = {The contribution of urbanisation and climate conditions to increased
   urban heat load in Zagreb (Croatia) since the 1960s},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urban climate is affected by weather, global climate change and urban
   development. However, climate change and urbanisation take place
   simultaneously with intertwined impacts. To analyse their relative
   contribution to the heat load of Zagreb, a modelling approach is applied
   to two land-use/land-cover (LULC) situations and corresponding climate
   conditions. The results indicate that the change in total heat load is
   dominantly affected by climate change (-88\%) with an average increase
   in the summer days for 35 days. LULC alterations have a weaker impact
   (-12\%), but they strongly affect heat load spatial variability. The
   sign of LULC related heat load change de-pends on the type of the change
   (e.g. an increase is detected in areas that have turned from green into
   built-up classes). Generally, LULC effect is limited to the area with
   the modification, however it can spread to adjacent areas due to the
   processes like advection and evapotranspiration. In areas with
   considerable LULC alterations, their impact on the heat load is
   comparable to that of climate change. These results highlight the
   potential of change in the city infrastructure for climate adaptation,
   as well as emphasise the importance of considering future climate
   conditions when assessing efficiency of climate adaptation measures.},

Title = {Structure of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) diversity in West Africa
   covaries with a climatic gradient},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Sub-Saharan agriculture has been identified as vulnerable to ongoing
   climate change. Adaptation of agriculture has been suggested as a way to
   maintain productivity. Better knowledge of intra-specific diversity of
   varieties is prerequisites for the successful management of such
   adaptation. Among crops, root and tubers play important roles in food
   security and economic growth for the most vulnerable populations in
   Africa. Here, we focus on the sweet potato. The Sweet potato (Ipomoea
   batatas) was domesticated in Central and South America and was later
   introduced into Africa and is now cultivated throughout tropical Africa.
   We evaluated its diversity in West Africa by sampling a region extending
   from the coastal area of Togo to the northern Sahelian region of Senegal
   that represents a range of climatic conditions. Using 12 microsatellite
   markers, we evaluated 132 varieties along this gradient. Phenotypic data
   from field trials conducted in three seasons was also obtained. Genetic
   diversity in West Africa was found to be 18\% lower than in America.
   Genetic diversity in West Africa is structured into five groups, with
   some groups found in very specific climatic areas, e.g. under a tropical
   humid climate, or under a Sahelian climate. We also observed genetic
   groups that occur in a wider range of climates. The genetic groups were
   also associated with morphological differentiation, mainly the shape of
   the leaves and the color of the stem or root. This particular structure
   of diversity along a climatic gradient with association to phenotypic
   variability can be used for conservation strategies. If such structure
   is proved to be associated with specific climatic adaptation, it will
   also allow developing strategies to adapt agriculture to ongoing climate
   variation in West Africa.},

Title = {The Economic Value of Climate Information in Adaptation Decisions:
   Learning in the Sea-level Rise and Coastal Infrastructure Context},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {150},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Traditional methods of investment appraisal have been criticized in the
   context of climate change adaptation. Economic assessment of adaptation
   options needs to explicitly incorporate the uncertainty of future
   climate conditions and should recognise that uncertainties may diminish
   over time as a result of improved understanding and learning. Real
   options analysis (ROA) is an appraisal tool developed to incorporate
   concepts of flexibility and learning that relies on probabilistic data
   to characterise uncertainties. It is also a relatively
   resource-intensive decision support tool. We test whether, and to what
   extent, learning can result from the use of successive generations of
   real life climate scenarios, and how non-probabilistic uncertainties can
   be handled through adapting the principles of ROA in coastal economic
   adaptation decisions. Using a relatively simple form of ROA on a
   vulnerable piece of coastal rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom,
   and two successive UK climate assessments, we estimate the values
   associated with utilising up-dated information on sea-level rise. The
   value of learning can be compared to the capital cost of adaptation
   investment, and may be used to illustrate the potential scale of the
   value of learning in coastal protection, and other adaptation contexts.},

Title = {Sedimentation and coastal area management in the human-modified
   Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal delta plain of Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {The present work is an effort to expose the sedimentation rate of the
   Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) tidal delta plain from the subsurface-dated
   sediments samples. The study reveals that the average sedimentation
   rates (about 2.12-4.59 mm yr(-1)) of the area are not as good to
   minimize as the estimated range of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) (1-9
   mm yr(-1)). Moreover, the sediments cannot be distributed properly in
   the tidal and fluvio-tidal plains due to different anthropogenic
   activities like poldering and embankments. In addition, the upstream
   diversion of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers water reduces the
   suspended sediment load to the downstream and consequently, the
   sedimentation rates. Finally, the GB tidal delta plain and its coastal
   area are in a vulnerable situation in consideration of sedimentation
   rates, RSLR, and different anthropogenic activities. Therefore, regular
   monitoring and evaluation is essential about sedimentation, coastal and
   upstream anthropogenic practices, RSLR, etc., for the implementation of
   effective and efficient mitigation and adaptation measures in the
   deltaic plains.},

Abstract = {Volatile fuel prices are a threat to the viability of UK fishing
   communities. The economic and social impacts of rising fuel costs for
   fishers and communities in southwest England are examined. Fuel prices
   doubled between early 2007 and mid-2008, whereas fish prices remained
   relatively stable throughout as a result of the price-setting power of
   seafood buyers. It was the fishers who absorbed the increased costs,
   resulting in significant loss of income, reduced job security, and
   problems in recruiting crew. All gear types were affected, but fishers
   using towed gears were most adversely impacted. Fishing vessels with
   recent investment have greater fuel efficiency, so appeared to be more
   able to cope and to adapt to increased fuel costs. Fishing behaviour
   also altered as skippers attempted to increase fuel efficiency at the
   cost of reduced catches. Most skippers reported fishing closer to port,
   reducing their exploratory fishing, and ceasing experimentation with
   fishing gears with lesser environmental impact. Therefore, a threat to
   fishing community viability may have linked environmental effects. The
   impacts of this fuel price volatility foreshadow a likely future impact
   of rising fuel prices attributable to climate change adaptation and
   mitigation and forecasts of rising oil prices. Without proactive
   planning and policy development, rising fuel prices have the potential
   to cause job losses and economic hardship additional to problems that
   may arise from poor management and stock decline, in all fishing-related
   sectors of the industry.},

Abstract = {Climate change is likely to intensify severe impacts of disasters and
   extreme weather events on resilience and sustainability of coastal urban
   areas. The solutions for enhancing sustainability and climate resilience
   of the coastal urban areas depend on multivariables and dimensions such
   as social, human, institutional, economic, and natural conditions and
   resources. It is therefore needed to develop a set of indicators for
   evaluating the adaptive capacity of urban systems and communities to
   climate change. In this chapter, we analyzed the status quo of climate
   variability, climate-related disasters, vulnerability, and adaptive
   capacity to climate change of Da Nang city, Vietnam, for developing a
   proposal of response measures to climate change. Results showed that Da
   Nang city has been impacted by several disasters, consisting of
   typhoons, floods, sea level rise, drought, saline intrusion, landslides,
   erosions, and forest fires. The vulnerability to climate change and
   disasters of Da Nang city is classified into low, average, high, and
   very high levels. The measures for reducing vulnerability and enhancing
   resilience to climate change and sustainability include increasing the
   resilience of natural environments and ecosystems and social systems,
   enhancing the urban governance for climate change adaptation, and
   promoting the transformative capacity from climate change to sustainable
   development opportunities.},

Title = {Identifying Ecosystem Surface Areas Available for Nature-Based Flood
   Risk Mitigation in Coastal Cities Around the World},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {1335-1344},

Abstract = {Nature-based risk mitigation is increasingly proposed as a strategy to
   cope with global changes that increase flood risks in coastal areas.
   However, loss of coastal ecosystems reduces their mitigating effect on
   coastal flood risks in many places around the world. Here, we identify
   global urban hot spots exposed to storm surge flood risks, where
   conservation of existing coastal ecosystems can contribute to
   nature-based risk mitigation. We present a global procedure identifying
   the most likely pathways followed by storm surges from the open sea
   toward 136 cities around the world and quantifying the extent of
   mangrove forests, salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs along
   these storm surge pathways. Instead of being locally precise, our
   procedure aims to be globally applicable, in order to identify cities
   around the world where ecosystems can have a positive effect on storm
   surge risk mitigation and where further local-scale, more precise
   assessments are advised. Our results show that cities that combine large
   flood-exposed populations (> 400,000 people exposed to 1-in-100-year
   storm events) and large potential for nature-based risk mitigation (>
   200 km2 of coastal ecosystems) are located in large river deltas and
   estuaries, such as Khulna (Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, Bangladesh),
   Guayaquil (Guayas delta, Ecuador), Ho Chi Minh City (Mekong delta,
   Vietnam), and New Orleans (Mississippi Delta, USA). Here, conservation
   of mangroves and salt marshes plays a key role. Cities with large
   flood-exposed populations and/or assets, but few ecosystems, are either
   located directly adjacent to coastlines or where former wetlands have
   been reclaimed, especially in European and Asian cities. Overall, 75\%
   of the studied cities benefit from flood risk mitigation by present
   ecosystems and from additional ecosystem services. Hence, our study
   identifies global urban hot spots where more detailed local studies are
   advised on the effectiveness of conservation and (re-)creation of
   coastal ecosystems as a sustainable strategy for nature-based mitigation
   of increasing coastal flood risks.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Volume = {107},

Abstract = {This paper explores the conceptual and practical linkages between
   climate change governance, diversity of authority and regenerative
   sustainability. It empirically explains such linkages in the context of
   adaptive flood risk management in the delta cities of Rotterdam and Hong
   Kong which are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It addresses
   three questions: 1) if what is being witnessed is a transition to more
   inclusive, engaging, empowering, place-sensitive modes of urban climate
   governance gaining authority to deliver climate policy, how should these
   transitions be conceptualized and analysed? 2) how do transitions
   towards collaborative governance and regenerative sustainability and the
   deployment of authority in these transitions serve manage the risk of
   flooding in places with different cultural and climatic settings? 3)
   what do different cases demonstrate in terms of the practical pathways
   and examples of implementation of regenerative sustainability?
   Conceptual and empirical understandings are needed to assess whether
   these new, flexible forms of governance might ultimately challenge
   state-centred authority in the policy responses to climate change. This
   paper reveals that new governance systems are diluting, not supplanting,
   state authority. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Pelagic fauna is expected to be impacted under climate change according

   observation-based statistical studies. Here we compile a global
   underwater sonar database and 20 ocean climate projections to predict
   the future distribution of sound-scattering fauna around the world's
   oceans. We show that global pelagic fauna will be seriously compromised
   by the end of the twenty-first century if we continue under the current
   greenhouse emission scenario. Low and mid latitudes are expected to lose
   from 3\% to 22\% of animal biomass due to the expansion of
   low-productive systems, while higher latitudes would be populated by
   present-day temperate fauna, supporting results from ecosystem
   simulations. We further show that strong mitigation measures to contain
   global warming below 2 degrees C would reduce these impacts to less than
   half.},

Title = {Large discrepancies in summer climate change over Europe as projected by
   global and regional climate models: causes and consequences},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {2981-3002},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We assess the differences of future climate changes over Europe in
   summer as projected by state-of-the-art regional climate models (RCM,
   from the EURO-Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) and by their
   forcing global climate models (GCM, from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5) and study the associated physical
   mechanisms. We show that important discrepancies at large-scales exist
   between global and regional projections. The RCMs project at the end of
   the 21st century over a large area of Europe a summer warming 1.5-2 K
   colder, and a much smaller decrease of precipitation of 5\%, versus 20\%
   in their driving GCMs. The RCMs generally simulate a much smaller
   increase in shortwave radiation at surface, which directly impacts
   surface temperature. In addition to differences in cloud cover changes,
   the absence of time-varying anthropogenic aerosols in most regional
   simulations plays a major role in the differences of solar radiation
   changes. We confirm this result with twin regional simulations with and
   without time-varying anthropogenic aerosols. Additionally, the RCMs
   simulate larger increases in evapotranspiration over the Mediterranean
   sea and larger increases/smaller decreases over land, which contribute
   to smaller changes in relative humidity, with likely impacts on clouds
   and precipitation changes. Several potential causes of these differences
   in evapotranspiration changes are discussed. Overall, this work suggests
   that the current EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble does not capture the upper
   part of the climate change uncertainty range, with important
   implications for impact studies and the adaptation policies that they
   inform.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The coastal communities of Clarence were increasingly concerned at the
   continual foreshore erosion and flooding which was occurring in their
   communities. Uncertainty surrounding the impacts of climate change
   through rising sea levels and severe storm events was of most concern to
   local residents. Council embarked on a program to assess these
   vulnerable locations and the resultant Integrated Assessment Report has
   provided Council with direction to act upon these concerns. Erosion
   hazard mapping based on 5 scenarios (present day, 2050 high \& low and 2
   100 high \&low) and inundation mapping indicating the impact of rising
   sea levels for present day, 2050 and 2100 have been embedded into
   Council's Planning Scheme. This provides a framework for developers and
   Council to account for potential impacts of climate change when planning
   development. The Integrated Assessment Report also provides recommended
   adaptive actions for Council to assess and consider for implementation.
   The Report identified 4 highly vulnerable locations and these have been
   Council's focus over past years when implementing the recommendations.
   This paper describes the journey taken by Clarence City Council from the
   initial community concerns through to implementation of adaptation
   treatments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Previous studies on tidal flood mapping are mostly through continental-
   and/or global-scale approaches. Moreover, the few works on local-scale
   perception are concentrated in Europe, Asia, and North America. Here, we
   present a case study approaching a tidal flood risk mapping application
   in the face of climate change scenarios in a region with a strong
   environmental and social appeal. The study site is an estuarine cut in
   the Brazilian semi-arid region, covering part of two state conservation
   units, which has been suffering severe consequences from tidal flooding
   in recent years. In this case study, we used high-geodetic-precision
   data (lidar DEM), together with robust tidal return period statistics
   and data from current sea level rise scenarios. We found that
   approximately 327.60 km(2) of the estuary is under tidal flood risk and
   in need of mitigation measures. This case study can serve as a basis for
   future management actions, as well as a model for applying risk mapping
   in other coastal areas.},

Title = {Quantified analysis of the probability of flooding in the Thames estuary
   under imaginable worst-case sea level rise scenarios},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Most studies of the impacts of sea level rise (SLR) have explored
   scenarios of < 1 m during the 21st century, even though larger rises are
   possible. This paper takes a different approach and explores and
   quantifies the likely flood impacts in the Thames estuary for a number
   of plausible, but unlikely, SLR scenarios. The collapse of the Western
   Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) could cause global mean sea level to rise by
   5-6 m; here a time-scale for such an event of 100 years is assumed to
   create a worst-case scenario. Combined with the 1 in 1000 storm surge
   event, this would result in 1000 kW of land being frequently inundated.
   This area currently contains 1 million properties and their inundation
   would result in direct damage of at least 97.8 billion at 2003 prices.
   Smaller SLR scenarios, resulting from a partial collapse of the WAIS
   over 100 years, also have significant potential impacts, demonstrating
   the vulnerability of the Thames estuary to SLR. Construction of a new
   storm surge barrier in the outer Thames estuary is shown to provide
   greater resilience to unexpectedly high SLR because of the additional
   large flood storage capacity that the barrier would provide. This
   analysis has, for the first time, connected mechanisms of abrupt climate
   change and SLR with hydrodynamic modelling used to quantify impacts. In
   particular, it is recognized that future management strategies need to
   be adaptive and robust in order to manage the uncertainty associated
   with climate change.},

   temperatures across the United States},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Exposure to extreme temperatures is one primary cause of weather-related
   human mortality and morbidity. Global climate change raises the concern
   of public health under future extreme events, yet spatiotemporal
   population dynamics have been long overlooked in health risk
   assessments. Here, we show that the diurnal intra-urban movement alters
   residents' exposure to extreme temperatures during cold and heat waves.
   To do so, we incorporate weather simulations with commute-adjusted
   population profiles over 16 major U.S. metropolitan areas. Urban
   residents' exposure to heat waves is intensified by 1.9 degrees +/- 0.7
   degrees C (mean +/- SD among cities), and their exposure to cold waves
   is attenuated by 0.6 degrees +/- 0.8 degrees C. The higher than expected
   exposure to heat waves significantly correlates with the spatial
   temperature variability and requires serious attention. The essential
   role of population dynamics should be emphasized in temperature-related
   climate adaptation strategies for effective and successful
   interventions.},

Abstract = {In the early stages of rebuilding New Orleans, a decision has to be made
   on the level of flood protection the city should implement. Such
   decisions are usually based on cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). But in
   suchs an analysis, the results are contingent on a number of underlying
   assumptions and varying these assumptions can lead to different
   recommendations. Indeed, though a standard first-order analysis rules
   out Category 5 hurricane protection, taking into account climate change
   and other human-related disruptions of environment, second-order impacts
   of large-scale disasters, possible changes in the discount rate, risk
   aversion, and damage heterogeneity may make such hurricane protection a
   rational investment, even though countervailing risks and moral hazard
   issues reduce benefits. These results stress the high sensitivity of the
   CBA recommendation to several uncertain assumptions, highlight the
   importance of second-order costs and damage heterogeneity in welfare
   losses, and show how climate change creates an additional layer of
   uncertainty in infrastructure design that increases the probability of
   either under-adaptation (and increased risk) or over-adaptation (and
   sunk costs). In such a situation, alternative decision-making approaches
   should be favored. This paper suggests several strategies that are
   especially robust to uncertainty and that should be preferred in the
   current context of high uncertainty on future climate conditions.},

Title = {Ready-made oTree applications for the study of climate change adaptation
   behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {88},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is an intricate decision-making process
   that requires balancing costs and uncertain benefits in a setting with
   high stakes and low probabilities. Risk preferences then shape the way
   individuals or groups adapt to these settings, dependent or independent
   of public policy. With the aim of shedding light on these preferences
   and aid policy efficiency, we develop a set of Climate Change Adaptation
   Applications based on oTree (CAT). The set consists of eight discrete
   apps that correspond to different risk perception biases and corrective
   treatments. From a scientific perspective CAT can be used to better
   understand adaptation decision constraints at the individual and
   community level, while from a policy perspective it can help policy
   makers plan or improve existing adaptation strategies. A pilot
   experiment with 75 subjects was conducted to evaluate CAT functionality
   and the decision-making process. The experiment examined adaptation
   decisions under different risk levels in a home flood context. It
   successfully explored the impact of unknown risks, various time
   horizons, framing conditions, and group dynamics. The results show that
   adaptation decisions are strongly correlated with risk levels, and
   adaptation rate increases when uncertainty is introduced. Collective
   adaptation increases in group dynamics, although polarization is
   observed, and uncertainty reinforces this through collective inaction.
   In addition, typical subject characteristics, including age, gender and
   home ownership, have a significant impact on adaptation.},

Abstract = {The reaction of a mineral carbonate, such as limestone, with water and
   CO2 to form bicarbonate in solution, is explored as a CO:! mitigation
   strategy. Initial cost estimates for such a process range from \$18 to
   \$128 per tonne CO2 sequestered, with an energy penalty of about 8\% and
   with relatively low environmental impact. The regional availability and
   transport of water and mineral carbonate appear to be the primary
   determinants of the strategy's cost and applicability. The
   bicarbonate-rich waste effluent would be released into rivers or coastal
   waters, ultimately adding a small amount to the existing, very large
   bicarbonate reservoir in the ocean. For many applications, this form of
   `marine' carbon sequestration appears to be less costly, less affected
   by national and international regulations, more environmentally friendly
   and more effective over the long term than direct CO2 injection into the
   ocean. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chloride-induced corrosion is one of the main causes leading to the
   lifetime reduction of reinforced concrete (RC) structures in marine
   environments or subjected to de-icing salts. Modeling chloride ingress
   into concrete in a comprehensive way is therefore a crucial task to
   evaluate corrosion initiation risk and carry out preventive maintenance.
   Nevertheless, this comprehensive modeling is a challenging task that
   requires solving simultaneously a set of coupled non-linear partial
   differential equations. This task becomes more complex if the inherent
   uncertainties of the process are considered for probabilistic lifetime
   assessment. The present research aims to assess the probability of
   corrosion initiation of RC structures. The polynomial chaos expansion
   (PCE) method is employed to propagate uncertainties in a chloride
   ingress model requiring significant computational time to perform one
   deterministic simulation. PCE is also applied to perform a sensitivity
   analysis to determine which are the more influential random variables in
   the problem. The proposed methodology is applied to RC structures placed
   in several locations in France (Brest, Marseille, and Strasbourg) and
   subjected to realistic environmental conditions including climate
   change. The results show that the PCE-based model is accurate and
   efficient for lifetime assessment of RC structures subject to
   chloride-induced corrosion.},

Title = {Adaptive Control Strategy and Model of Gas-Drainage Parameters in Coal
   Seam},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For a long time, the serious mismatch between negative pressure and
   drainage parameters of underground gas drainage has been the main reason
   for the standing engineering problems in coal mines, such as low gas
   drainage concentration, fast decay, and low-utilization rate. Aiming at
   these problems, an innovative method by adding micro-frequency
   conversion drainage pumps and electronically controlled valves at the
   key nodes of the conventional pipe network system of gas drainage and
   the joint quantitative regulation of underground regulation facilities
   and surface drainage pumps based on the intrinsic correlation between
   the drainage parameters and negative pressure is proposed in this paper
   to solve the difficulty of how to regulate increasing pressure or
   resistance in the on-site gas-drainage system and to realize energy
   matching in the whole drainage system on demand. For this method, the
   study further defines the safety and efficiency criteria of gas
   drainage, proposes the adaptive control strategy of gas-drainage
   parameters, and establishes the adaptive control model based on particle
   swarm optimization. The model took the safety and efficiency criteria of
   gas drainage as the constraint conditions and the maximum gas-drainage
   flow or concentration as the objective function to adaptively adjust the
   operating conditions of drainage pumps, micro-frequency conversion
   drainage pumps, and electric control valves to realize the adaptive
   regulation of gas-drainage parameters. Finally, based on the adaptive
   control strategy and model of gas-drainage parameters, the numerical
   simulation research was carried out through Comsol with Matlab. The
   results show that the gas-drainage concentration and high-concentration
   drainage period can be increased many times, and the adaptive drainage
   parameters of valves and micro pumps can be adjusted intelligently,
   which provides a theoretical basis for the intelligent field
   implementation of gas.},

Title = {Space-Based Observations for Understanding Changes in the Arctic-Boreal
   Zone},
Journal = {REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Observations taken over the last few decades indicate that dramatic
   changes are occurring in the Arctic-Boreal Zone (ABZ), which are having
   significant impacts on ABZ inhabitants, infrastructure, flora and fauna,
   and economies. While suitable for detecting overall change, the current
   capability is inadequate for systematic monitoring and for improving
   process-based and large-scale understanding of the integrated components
   of the ABZ, which includes the cryosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and
   atmosphere. Such knowledge will lead to improvements in Earth system
   models, enabling more accurate prediction of future changes and
   development of informed adaptation and mitigation strategies. In this
   article, we review the strengths and limitations of current space-based
   observational capabilities for several important ABZ components and make
   recommendations for improving upon these current capabilities. We
   recommend an interdisciplinary and stepwise approach to develop a
   comprehensive ABZ Observing Network (ABZ-ON), beginning with an initial
   focus on observing networks designed to gain process-based understanding
   for individual ABZ components and systems that can then serve as the
   building blocks for a comprehensive ABZ-ON.},

Title = {Modulation of fatty acid profiles by global and local ocean change
   drivers in the ragworm Hediste diversicolor: implications for
   aquaculture production},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {542},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Global change projections predict significant impacts on the aquaculture
   sector leading to a substantial interest in the study of species'
   ecophysiological responses to increased temperature and shifting
   salinities. Here, we experimentally evaluated shifts on the fatty acid
   (FA) profiles of the ragworm Hediste diversicolor under global and local
   ocean change drivers. This polychaete is a suitable extractive organism
   for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) designs, as it maximizes
   the use of otherwise wasted nutrients present in particulate organic
   matter of farm effluents. Ragworms were collected from intertidal
   mudflats and subjected to an experimental trial of 28 days under control
   (24 degrees C), warming (27 degrees C) and heatwave (30 degrees C)
   scenarios combined with salinity variations (20 and 30) in a full
   factorial design. Individuals were sampled after 14 and 28 days of
   exposure (D14 and D28 respectively) for FA profile analysis.
   Interactions between temperature x day and salinity x day modulated
   ragworms' fatty acid profiles. Overall, an increase in different FA
   classes, as well as in En-3 UFA, En-6 UFA and essential fatty acids
   (EFA) was detected over time in polychaetes exposed to salinity 30,
   contrary to what was observed in salinity 20. This suggests that
   salinity 30 is an optimal condition for H. diversicolor FA enrichment.
   At this salinity, fatty acids from n-3 and n-6 families remained stable
   at 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C, with a decrease being detected at 30
   degrees C (after 14 days of exposure), possibly related to changes in
   the lipid composition of cell membranes to maintain homeostasis.
   However, after 28 days, no differences were detected, suggesting that
   polychaetes can acclimate to elevated temperatures when they are in
   optimal salinity conditions. In contrast, if an extreme warm event (30
   degrees C) is combined with low salinity (20), all FA classes increase
   at day 14 and HUFA class remain elevated after 28 days, while En-3 UFA,
   En-6 UFA, ARA, EPA and DHA decrease, suggesting their potential role in
   osmotic balance and membrane fluidity. Still, if ragworms are grown at
   low salinity and the increase in temperature is only moderate, En-3 UFA,
   En-6 UFA, ARA, EPA and DHA increase. This study shows that heatwaves can
   have an impact on H. diversicolor aquaculture, especially under low
   salinity conditions, by decreasing EFA. Risk assessment and adaptation
   strategies need to be implemented into aquaculture practices to mitigate
   the impacts of global change on the nutritional profile of farmed
   species and their overall commercial value.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING PERFORMANCE SIMULATION},
Abstract = {Climate change and the urban heat island (UHI) effects are increasing
   heat stress and adversely impacting outdoor thermal comfort in urban
   areas. The study demonstrates that thermal comfort conditions can be
   improved by reducing air temperature and surface temperature with the
   integration of street trees into the urban environment. In this work,
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using unsteady
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations have been performed to
   analyze the cooling effect of street trees for heatwave period (18-22
   June 2015) in a hot-humid urban environment. The results are then
   compared in-term-of air/surface temperature, flow-velocity and apparent
   temperature for the vegetation case, open-space case, and built case.
   The analysis shows that the vegetation can effectively decrease
   surrounding temperature (a reduction of 1.2 K), thereby reducing energy
   consumption and effectively promote thermal comfort conditions. The
   study findings will encourage city planners and citizens to take action
   for urban greening.},

Title = {How close to the coast? Incorporating coastal expertise into
   decision-making on residential development in Australia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {237-247},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The most recent assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change confirms the importance of adaptation strategies such as
   `retreat, accommodate or protect' but emphasizes the significance of
   institutional and governance structures in decision-making. Even without
   the threat of climate change there is a legacy of vulnerable coastal
   development in many parts of the world where there has been a lack of
   understanding of coastal processes. Coastal vulnerability and adaptation
   strategies are well covered in the literature but the extent to which
   coastal experts are used to advise on development in vulnerable coastal
   areas has to date received scant attention.
   Expert coastal advice is essential to reduce vulnerability of coastal
   residential development to both existing coastal erosion and flooding
   and in particular to the threat of increased vulnerability associated
   with future climate change. This paper uses the Australian system of
   coastal management, where responsibilities rest mostly with state
   governments, to discuss the nature of coastal experts and the types of
   advice they provide. We focus specifically on the relevant legislation,
   statutory coastal authorities, coastal strategies, coastal planning and
   decision-making, where there are clear pathways for incorporating expert
   coastal advice. Only four states have dedicated coastal legislation and
   each state has its own planning legislation, which is linked to one or
   more pieces of legislation covering coastal development. Two case
   studies are used from different states to illustrate how these
   mechanisms for incorporating expert advice operate in practice. Our
   analysis includes both anecdotal case studies plus a more detailed
   quantitative analysis from one state using a decade of records to
   illustrate temporal patterns in the use of expert advice.
   The paper concludes that Australia has a variable use of adopting
   coastal expert advice into the coastal residential development approval
   process because each state has different stages where the advice is
   incorporated into its planning system. These variations can be
   represented along a continuum of specificity for expert advice provided.
   It appears that none of the states provides a fail-safe mechanism to
   prevent residential development being built too close to the coast as
   shown by case studies described. In one state there is a statutory
   requirement for referral to an expert coastal body but a proportion of
   the advice is ignored. Most state jurisdictions are now attempting to
   mainstream expert advice into planning legislation, policies and
   guidelines so that best practice principles are adopted early in the
   development approval process in order to avoid building too close to the
   coast.},

Title = {Times and partners are a-changin': relationships between declining food
   abundance, breeding success, and divorce in a monogamous seabird species},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {Seabirds exhibit considerable adjustment capacity to cope with
   environmental changes during the breeding season and to maximize
   lifetime reproductive output. For example, divorce has been proposed to
   be an adaptive behavioral strategy in social monogamous species, as a
   response to poor conditions and low breeding success. Here, we studied
   divorce at the population and individual levels in northern gannets
   (Morus bassanus, hereafter gannets) nesting on Bonaventure island
   (Quebec, Canada). At the population level, we used Granger's method for
   detecting and quantifying temporal causality between time series (from
   2009 to 2019) of divorce rate and breeding success of gannets (n = 809)
   and we evaluated the relationship between breeding success and biomass
   of their two principal prey (Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus, and
   Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus). Our results indicated that breeding
   success is mainly influenced by the spawning-stock biomass of Atlantic
   mackerel, and a decrease in breeding success is followed by an increase
   in divorce rate with a 1-year lag. However, the effect of the
   interaction between breeding success and year on the proportion of
   individuals that divorced showed significant inter-annual variation. At
   the individual level, our results support the adaptive strategy
   hypothesis of divorce. Indeed, gannets that changed partners did so
   following a reproductive failure, and there was an increase in breeding
   success 1 year following the divorce. Being central place foragers,
   opportunities for dispersal and adaptation are often limited for
   breeding seabirds in a context of low food abundance. We suggest that
   behavioral flexibility expressed as divorce would be an efficient
   short-term strategy for maintaining reproductive performance.},

Abstract = {The Canadian Arctic is experiencing rapid changes in climatic
   conditions, with implications for Inuit communities widely documented.
   Youth have been identified as an at-risk population, with likely impacts
   on mental health and well-being. This study identifies and characterizes
   youth-specific protective factors that enhance well-being in light of a
   rapidly changing climate, and examines how climatic and environmental
   change challenges these. In-depth conversational interviews were
   conducted with youth aged 15-25 from the five communities of the
   Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada: Nain, Hopedale, Postville,
   Makkovik, and Rigolet. Five key protective factors were identified as
   enhancing their mental health and well-being: being on the land;
   connecting to Inuit culture; strong communities; relationships with
   family and friends; and staying busy. Changing sea ice and weather
   conditions were widely reported to be compromising these protective
   factors by reducing access to the land, and increasing the danger of
   land-based activities. This study contributes to existing work on
   Northern climate change adaptation by identifying factors that enhance
   youth resilience and, if incorporated into adaptation strategies, may
   contribute to creating successful and effective adaptation responses.

Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {371},
Pages = {26-36},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Recent regulations regarding water quality motivated research in reverse
   osmosis (RO) technology for water desalination especially under boron
   restrictions. Boron control in the permeate products by reverse osmosis
   technology comprises several mitigation options which impose capital and
   operation costs. In our study, we investigate the design of RO system
   under the design concept of split partial second pass reverse osmosis
   (SPSPRO) in order to allow extraction of permeate streams along the RO
   pressure vessels. The design approach is based on superstructure
   optimization which allows the identification of optimal process layout
   and optimal operation conditions of the process units. pH adjustment of
   the network streams is also included in the model to control boron
   species distribution during the separation process. A mixed integer
   nonlinear program (MINLP) model is subsequently formulated based on the
   superstructure representation. The mathematical programming formulation
   is demonstrated on a case study to show the application of the
   mathematical programming model. The results show lower treatment cost
   through the proposed mathematical programming model. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Functional Richness and Resilience in Coral Reef Communities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Within the Anthropocene the functional diversity of coral communities is
   changing rapidly, putting the resilience of many coral reef ecosystems
   in jeopardy. A better understanding of the relationship between coral
   functional diversity and reef resilience could reveal practical ways to
   achieve increased resilience. However, manipulating coral diversity
   experimentally is challenging, and consequently the links between coral
   functional diversity, resilience, and ecosystem functioning remain
   obscure. We used an ecologically detailed agent-based model to conduct a
   virtual experiment in which functional diversity was manipulated over
   the entire trait space of scleractinian corals. Using an imputed trait
   dataset of 798 coral species and eight key functional traits, we
   assembled 245 functionally distinct coral communities, which we
   subjected to a cyclone and bleaching event. We then measured four
   different aspects of their resilience and quantified for each measure
   the respective effect of (i) the functional richness (FRic), and (ii)
   community-weighted means (CWM) of four types of trait: effect,
   resistance, recovery, and competitive. FRic represents the volume
   occupied by a community in the functional space, while CWM indicates the
   location of the communities' centroid in the functional space. We found
   a significant and positive effect of FRic on three measures of
   resilience: communities with higher FRic recovered surface cover faster
   and had more rugosity and cover 10 years after the disturbances. In
   contrast, the resistance of the coral community-i.e., the capacity to
   maintain surface cover when subjected to the disturbances-was
   independent of FRic and was determined primarily by the CWM of
   resistance traits. By analyzing community dynamics and functional
   trade-offs, we show that FRic increases resilience via the selection and
   the insurance effects due to the presence of competitive species in the
   functional space, i.e., those highly dominant species that contribute
   the most to the complexity of the habitat and recover quickly from
   disturbances. Building from the results of our experiment and the trait
   correlation analysis, we discuss the potential for FRic to serve as a
   proxy measure of resilience and we present a strategy that can provide
   direction to on-going reef restoration efforts, and pave the way for
   sustaining coral communities in a context of rapid global change.},

Title = {Enhanced Hydrate-Based Geological CO2 Capture and Sequestration as a
   Mitigation Strategy to Address Climate Change},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Geological sequestration of CO2-rich gas as a CO2 capture and storage
   technique has a lower technical and cost barrier compared to industrial
   scale-up. In this study, we have proposed CO2 capture and storage via
   hydrate in geological formation within the hydrate stability zone as a
   novel technique to contribute to global warming mitigation strategies,
   including carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and to prevent
   vast methane release into the atmosphere caused by hydrate melting. We
   have attempted to enhance total gas uptake and CO2 capture efficiency in
   hydrate in the presence of kinetic promoters while using diluted CO2 gas
   (CO2-N-2 mixture). Experiments are performed using unfrozen sands within
   hydrate stability zone condition and in the presence of low dosage
   surfactant and amino acids. Hydrate formation parameters, including
   sub-cooling temperature, induction time, total gas uptake, and split
   fraction, are calculated during the single-step formation and
   dissociation process. The effect of sands with varying particle sizes
   (160-630 mu m, 1400-5000 mu m), low dosage promoter (500-3000 ppm) and
   CO2 concentration in feed gas (20-30 mol\%) on formation kinetic
   parameters was investigated. Enhanced formation kinetics are observed in
   the presence of surfactant (1000-3000 ppm) and hydrophobic amino acids
   (3000 ppm) at 120 bar and 1 celcius experimental conditions. We report
   induction time in the range of 7-170 min and CO2 split fraction
   (0.60-0.90) in hydrate for 120 bar initial injection pressure. CO2 split
   fraction can be enhanced by reducing sand particle size or increasing
   the CO2 mol\% in incoming feed gas at given injection pressure. This
   study also reports that formation kinetics in a porous medium are
   influenced by hydrate morphology. Hydrate morphology influences gas and
   water migration within sediments and controls pore space or particle
   surface correlation with the formation kinetics within coarse sediments.
   This investigation demonstrates the potential application of
   bio-friendly amino acids as promoters to enhance CO2 capture and storage
   within hydrate. Sufficient contact time at gas-liquid interface and
   higher CO2 separation efficiency is recorded in the presence of amino
   acids. The findings of this study could be useful in exploring the
   promoter-driven pore habitat of CO2-rich hydrates in sediments to
   address climate change.},

Abstract = {Vegetative enhancement in the form of tree planting has been found to be
   a highly effective strategy for cooling urban environments, yet as
   cities continue to warm, the suitability of urban environments for some
   tree species is changing with shifting hardiness zones. Trees are
   assigned to hardiness zones, which are based on the average annual
   minimum temperature that a species can thrive. In recent decades, human
   induced global warming has shifted the location of hardiness zones
   across the United States. Our study examines the historical range of
   similar to 200 common US tree species and how climate change-induced
   shifts in hardiness zones are affecting historical tree ranges in 20
   highly populated metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with high rates
   of urban heat island growth over time. MSAs are areas with at least one
   urban area of 50,000 or more people and adjoining territory that has a
   high degree of social and economic integration with the core. We found 6
   of the 20 MSAs lost tree species, with the Atlanta (13.51\%) and
   Washington DC (3.61\%) MSAs suffering the greatest losses. If historical
   rates of hardiness zone migration continue, a simple projection exhibits
   >6\% average tree species loss across all MSAs in the study. As
   hardiness zones continue to migrate northward with climate change, heat
   island mitigation and other environmental management strategies
   employing green infrastructure must identify tree species that are
   likely to remain well adapted to urban climates many years into the
   future. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Global-warming-caused changes of temperature and oxygen alter the
   proteomic profile of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {193},
Pages = {27-43},

Abstract = {Multiple environmental stressors caused by global warming influence the
   regulation of proteins involved in various biological processes in
   aquatic organisms. As an important component of the marine ecosystem,
   sea cucumber is a suitable echinoderm species for researching stress
   responses. In this study, we have investigated the proteomic response of
   respiratory trees in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus, challenged
   with environmental stresses by using the iTRAQ technique. Results showed
   that 262, 155 and 433 proteins were differentially regulated in response
   to heat, hypoxia, and heat plus hypoxia, respectively. Expression of key
   genes and proteins were measured by real-time PCR and western blot to
   validate the accuracy of the proteome files. Results showed that the
   interaction between these two stressors has an additive effect at the
   proteome level. Proteins involved in amino acid and carbohydrate
   metabolic processes were largely induced by heat while repressed by
   hypoxia. Exposure to multiple climate change stressors caused several
   proteins involved in lipid metabolic progress to be down-regulated and
   lipid catabolic processes were induced. Additionally, hypoxia and the
   combined stress induced proteins involved in iron homeostasis. ATP
   synthesis and gluconeogenesis were induced under heat and the combined
   stress, while ATP and glycogen synthesis were depressed under hypoxia.
   Proteins related with immune and defense response were largely induced
   and protein synthesis ability was depressed under all three stresses.
   Thus, sea cucumber may adopt different strategies to cope with varied
   environmental stress, and the situation in heat group is more similar
   with the combined treatment than hypoxia group. These proteomic changes
   in response to high-temperature and low-oxygen levels may provide
   insights into the defense strategies of sea cucumber in response to
   global climate changes.
   Significance of the study: The study focused on comparative quantitative
   proteomics on Apostichopus japonicus respiratory tree using iTRAQ in
   responses to multiple climate change stressors: heat, hypoxia and the
   combined stress. Data showed that A. japonicus can have an acute
   reaction in diverse biological pathways to both individual and
   interacting environmental stress, including substance metabolism, signal
   transduction, protein synthesis, immune response and energy production.
   Results indicated that sea cucumber adopted different strategies to cope
   with varied environmental stress, and the interaction between these two
   stressors has an additive effect at the proteome level. These results
   offer insight into the molecular regulation of A. japonicus to multiple
   environmental stress and reveal possible molecular events in sea
   cucumber under climate changes. The understanding of adaptive variation
   under global climate changes in aquatic organisms could be improved.},

Title = {Salinity-affected threshold yield loss: A signal of adaptation tipping
   points for salinity management of dry season rice cultivation in the
   coastal areas of Bangladesh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {288},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The potential existence of threshold yield loss in dry season rice
   growing systems under coastal saline environment remains unexplored, a
   scenario that could have policy relevance in government planning of rice
   intensification in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. This study applied
   the adaptation tipping points (ATPs) approach to investigate threshold
   yield loss from multiple perspectives of farmers affected by salinity.
   Data were generated from 280 randomly-selected farmers (rice farmers, n
   = 109; shrimp farmers, n = 107; salt farmers, n = 64) from two coastal
   sub-districts using a semi-structured survey. Key informant interviews
   and focus group discussions were conducted to complement the survey
   results. Our study revealed that despite government actions to promote
   dry season rice cultivation, farmers have been growing less rice in this
   season, with salinityaffected yield loss being the prime reason. Most of
   the rice farmers have considered that they would discontinue rice
   cultivation in this season due to yield loss, while shrimp and salt
   farmers have already reduced rice cultivation for the same reason and
   shifted to shrimp and salt farming as they perceived these enterprises
   as highly profitable and require less labour than rice farming. Rice
   farmers would tolerate a greater rice yield loss (23\%) under saline
   conditions compared with the shrimp (16\%) and salt farmers (14\%). The
   yield loss thresholds indicate the need for government actions to
   support and encourage integrated land management for rice, shrimp and
   salt farming, rather than research and extension efforts for dry season
   rice expansion alone. These actions could strengthen sustainable
   livelihood options to ensure food security, and contribute to the
   achievement of sustainable development goals, for instance no poverty
   (SDG-1), zero hunger (SDG-2), and good health and wellbeing (SDG-3).},

Title = {Costa Resiliente: A Serious Game Co-Designed to Foster Resilience
   Thinking},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Resilience thinking is critical for improving disaster preparedness,
   response, and adaptation. While there are several strategies focused on
   assessing resilience capacity in human communities, there are few
   strategies focused on fostering resilience thinking. Game-based learning
   is an active and immersive teaching strategy that can foster complex
   skills such as resilience. However, this field needs further research in
   terms of its potential to strengthen community resilience to disasters.
   In this paper, we validated a serious game to foster community
   resilience. We present the collaborative creation process for the
   development of the board game Costa Resiliente, and its subsequent
   migration into a video game. We have developed an experimental study to
   evaluate the contributions of the mobile game against the board game.
   The result is a technological tool based on scientific knowledge to
   foster resilience thinking in coastal human communities exposed to
   hazards. The board game was developed using data from local research on
   community resilience, and from experts in emergency planning and
   developing games collected in focus groups. The board game's effect on
   fostering resilience thinking was validated with school students from a
   coastal town. During the migration process into a video game, we used a
   design thinking methodological approach for the co-creation of
   audiovisual elements, in which beneficiaries participate actively and
   early. Through this approach, visual and auditory elements that are
   familiar to coastal communities were integrated into the video game
   elements. Our study indicates that game-based learning is a useful
   approach to foster resilience thinking, and that a better gaming
   experience can be provided by a video game. The potential of this video
   game for educating young age groups about community resilience is
   further discussed.},

Abstract = {Oil and gas exploration and production operations have the potential to
   cause a variety of impacts on the environment depending upon the stage
   of the process, the nature and sensitivity of the surrounding
   environment, and pollution prevention, mitigation and control
   techniques. The purpose of this research is to outline the issues that
   need to be considered when establishing an Environmental Management Plan
   (EMP) for the development and exploitation of offshore natural gas. The
   study explains the steps performed when preparing an environmental
   management study for the development and exploitation of natural gas.
   The case study is located offshore, approximately 30 to 50 km north of
   Alexandria in the Egyptian sector of the Mediterranean. The
   environmental management study includes a baseline environmental
   assessment of the site, the project impact on the environment, an
   environmental impact assessment, mitigation measures, and a monitoring
   plan. The study examines all aspects and activities of the study area in
   terms of the impact on the environmental components, provides the best
   alternatives to preserve the environment, and avoids potential negative
   effects during the construction and operation of the project to outline
   the issues that need to be considered when establishing an EMP for gas
   offshore platforms and other related facilities. However, as each
   development intervention is unique, a one-size-fits-all approach is not
   applicable. Key issues may differ from one project to another.
   Accordingly, specific key issues may be identified through a planning
   focus meeting and through consultation with the existing community.},

Title = {MALDIVIAN DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION IN TOURISM
   SECTOR: LESSONS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE 2030 CORPORATE AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Series = {Advances in Sustainability and Environmental Justice},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {113-131},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to address the issue of climate
   change and its effects on developing insular countries like the Maldives
   in order to identify adaptive mechanisms and new opportunities in the
   international context towards achieving sustainable development, taking
   into account its environmental and social incidences.
   Design/methodology/approach - Firstly, the chapter introduces some
   generalities of the Republic of the Maldives and its current challenges.
   Next, there is a description of the economy of the islands: here the
   importance of its major source of income, the tourism industry, is
   highlighted. Then, vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms are explored
   for the particular case of tourism.
   Findings - Maldivian current efforts in disaster risk management (DRM)
   mitigation, preparedness, response, and reconstruction stages, and the
   work between government, private organizations, and civil society,
   implemented since the 2004 tsunami; and as a response to climate change,
   are examples of how to apply collaborative approaches proposed by
   Sustainable Development Objectives, COP21 agreement, and Sendai
   Framework.
   Research limitations/implications - It is difficult to measure the
   consequences of sustainable development actions by the Maldivian
   government, especially in the international environment.
   Practical implications - The study of the Maldivian DRM strategy in the
   context of climate change and the lessons from the Maldives' tourism
   sector development under climate action serves as a model for other
   international business organizations which aim to reach sustainable
   development standards in the Post-2015 Development Agenda.
   Originality/value - This chapter evaluated important opportunities for
   sustainable development agenda that can be learned from DRM measures in
   Maldives.},

Abstract = {The severe drought that affected large areas of Europe in Spring and
   Summer 2022 hit the Po valley (northern Italy) with an intense water
   scarcity crisis. Productive activities, particularly agriculture,
   suffered the consequences of water shortage, and the coastal regions of
   the Po Delta underwent extensive saltwater intrusion. By relying on
   observed discharge records and on precipitation data from reanalysis and
   climate models, we analyse the 2022 event in the framework of the recent
   past statistics and in future scenarios. Alongside with a projection of
   future rainfall regimes on the Po River basin in two climate change
   scenarios, our analysis shows that persistent negative rainfall
   anomalies like the ones that characterised the 2022 event, though
   unlikely to become a typical feature of future climate, could remarkably
   increase their frequency, particularly in a severe climate change
   condition. Moreover, their impacts will be magnified by rising
   temperatures and, in coastal areas, by rising sea level, enhancing the
   salinisation of agricultural lands and altering the dynamics of
   transitional ecosystems. While providing a first quantitative assessment
   of an event that struck a strategic productive and environmental region
   of the Italian territory, this brief communication points out the
   importance of a multi-disciplinary, basin-scale approach to climate
   change adaptation.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Protected areas are key conservation tools for biodiversity management,
   but they are failing to protect species from current climate change.
   Focusing on protected areas representing montane, arid, coastal, and
   marine ecosystems, we provide examples of climate change induced range
   dynamics, includihg species' moving out of protected areas, disease
   range expansions, severe population declines, and even extinctions.
   Climate change thus presents an immense challenge to protected areas but
   also an unparalleled opportunity to shift from managing for static,
   historical community composition toward managing for dynamic, novel
   assemblages, thus complementing the traditional individual-species
   approach with an ecosystem-services approach: In addition, protected
   areas are well positioned to lead the way in climate change mitigation.
   Protected area managers can start achieving these goals by strengthening
   their commitments in climate change research, community outreach, and

Abstract = {Factualised storytelling narratives may assist scientists to communicate
   inter-disciplinary, multi-scale climate change research with
   stakeholders and non-expert members of the community. Scientists are
   increasingly required to balance scientific rigour with storytelling
   narratives that can facilitate climate change mitigation and adaptation
   as new communication technologies evolve. In this editorial to the
   research front, `Climate impacts on marine system structure and
   function: molecules to ecosystems', a review of climate change coverage
   in the media since 1980 showed that climate change science had a
   substantial voice globally and, in particular, in countries with
   carbon-dependent economies. However, the effective communication of
   multi-scale climate change research in the media can be complicated by
   the complex messages, the lack of training scientists receive in
   communication, and the traditionally distant relationship that the
   scientific community has with the media and, more so, with the broader
   community. Considerable scientific effort is being made to overcome
   these challenges as additional responsibility is placed on the
   scientific community to produce newsworthy scientific outputs. However,
   the integration of inter-disciplinary, multi-scale information, such as
   outlined in this research front, can result in more holistic climate
   change stories that scientists can effectively communicate with
   stakeholders and the broader community.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {With increasing interest in feed-based methane mitigation strategies and
   regional legal directives aimed at methane production from the
   agricultural sector, identifying local sources of biological feed
   additives will be critical for rendering these strategies affordable. In
   a recent study, the red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis harvested offshore
   Australia was identified as highly effective for reducing methane
   production from enteric fermentation. Due to potential difference in
   methane-reduction potential and the financial burden associated with
   transporting the harvested seaweed over long distances, we examined
   locally sourced red seaweed A. taxiformis and brown seaweed Zonaria
   farlowii for their ability to mitigate methane production when added to
   feed widely used in the Californian dairy industry. At a dose rate of
   5\% dry matter (DM), California-sourced A. taxiformis and Z. farlowii
   reduced methane production by up to 74\% (p < 0.05) and 11\% (p < 0.05)
   during in vitro rumen fermentation, respectively. No effect on CO2
   production was observed for either seaweed. The measured decrease in
   methane production induced by A. taxiformis and Z. farlowii amendment,
   suggest that these local macroalgae are indeed promising candidates for
   biotic methane mitigation strategies in California, the largest milk
   producing state in the United States. To determine their real potential
   as methane mitigating feed supplements in the dairy industry, their
   effect in vivo will need to be investigated.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW},

Abstract = {Climate change, sea level rise, and storm surge events are now
   significant factors threatening critical water and wastewater
   infrastructure. Extreme storm events have increased the need for the
   preparation required to face the challenges of climate change. In
   October 2012, Hurricane Sandy impacted 13 wastewater treatment
   facilities in New York City alone, causing millions of dollars in
   damage. Sandy was only a tropical storm, with a wind speed of 22.35
   ms(-1) (50 mi/h), when it made landfall in New York; however, it caused
   havoc because it combined with other local cascading events. The storm
   damage was caused by cascading synergistic events, including storm
   surge, sea level rise, and rain, rather than a singular decisive event
   of factor. The disaster left behind by Superstorm Sandy alone magnifies
   the dire need to understand the damage scenarios and consequences, and
   to identify resiliency plans and mitigation strategies that take into
   account a multitude of parameters that contributed to the intensified
   and devastating impacts. This work formulated the critical factors into
   a new concept introduced here as total water level (TWL). Using
   hydrodynamic models, the flood depths and elevations were calculated for
   various return periods and hurricane categories for coastal and riverine
   flooding, considering TWL to demonstrate the role of cascading events.
   The results show the compound effect of extreme storm events as
   hurricane surge combines forces with sea level rise and rainfall events;
   it translated into an additional 2.74-4.26 m of flooding in two studied
   locations. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Mediterranean UNESCO World Heritage at risk from coastal flooding and

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {UNESCO World Heritage sites (WHS) located in coastal areas are
   increasingly at risk from coastal hazards due to sea-level rise. In this
   study, we assess Mediterranean cultural WHS at risk from coastal
   flooding and erosion under four sea-level rise scenarios until 2100.
   Based on the analysis of spatially explicit WHS data, we develop an
   index-based approach that allows for ranking WHS at risk from both
   coastal hazards. Here we show that of 49 cultural WHS located in
   low-lying coastal areas of the Mediterranean, 37 are at risk from a
   100-year flood and 42 from coastal erosion, already today. Until 2100,
   flood risk may increase by 50\% and erosion risk by 13\% across the
   region, with considerably higher increases at individual WHS. Our
   results provide a first-order assessment of where adaptation is most
   urgently needed and can support policymakers in steering local-scale
   research to devise suitable adaptation strategies for each WHS.},

Abstract = {Although research suggests that family dynamics likely play a role in
   shaping children's behaviors, few studies focus on environmental
   behaviors, and none to our knowledge investigate how parents shape
   climate change mitigation behaviors among their children. We begin to
   fill this gap through a quantitative case study using matched
   household-level survey data from 182 coastal North Carolina families (n
   = 241 parents aged 29-77; n = 182 students aged 11-14) associated with
   15 middle school science teachers. Family climate change discussions,
   parent behaviors, and children's climate change concern levels predicted
   the degree to which children will participate in individual-level
   climate mitigation behaviors. These results provide evidence that
   promoting climate-related conversations within households may promote
   climate action even when parents are apathetic about climate change.
   Similarly, parental behaviors, but not their concern levels, were
   important predictors of adolescent behaviors. This study highlights
   novel ways that family dynamics may promote climate change mitigating
   behaviors and a new pathway to promoting climate mitigation at familial,
   and ultimately, societal levels.},

Title = {Potential effects of management options on marine recreational fisheries
   - the example of the western Baltic cod fishery},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {79},
Number = {3},

Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Globally, marine recreational fishing is a popular activity that
   contributes substantially to fishing mortality for some stocks and
   therefore should be considered in stock assessments and fisheries
   management. Using the example of the German western Baltic Sea
   recreational cod fishery, this study examines the effects of the
   first-time introduction of a bag limit on a previously largely
   unregulated marine recreational fishery. Furthermore, the study
   simulates and compares effects of different bag limits, seasonal
   closures, minimum length, and harvest slot limits to inform scientists,
   stakeholders, and managers about alternative management strategies and
   their potential effects on the fishery. After the first-time
   introduction of the bag limit, recreational removals decreased more than
   expected and the fishing participation slightly declined. The
   simulations showed that management measures adapted to the fishing
   methods reduced recreational removals but with different effects on cod
   length distributions and angler welfare. A combination of a high bag
   limit, seasonal closure and size/slot limits were most suitable for
   limiting cod removals with minimal impacts on angler welfare. This study
   demonstrates that recreational fisheries management measures need to be
   evaluated considering fishing methods and angler preferences before
   their implementation to avoid unexpected biological, social, and
   economic consequences.},

Title = {Climate change impact on building surfaces and facades},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {374-385},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare indicative expected
   changes in maintenance costs' due to changes in corrosion of building
   facades caused by climate change or by possible reduction of air
   pollution, in Norway and Europe.
   Design/methodology/approach - Available climate and pollution
   dose-corrosion response functions from the literature were used to
   calculate corrosion costs for buildings facades and construction
   surfaces. Metals and stone were used as indicator materials.
   Findings - An annual average temperature increase of 2 degrees C and
   increase in precipitation of 20 per cent in the city of Bergen in
   western Norway in the twenty-first century is likely to increase
   maintenance costs of building facades as much or more than a 50 per cent
   reduction in the concentrations of single air pollutants, and similarly
   to between 20 per cent and 50 per cent reduction in all the air
   pollutants, minus chloride, that have been found to corrode the
   materials. An increase in costs up to about 1 Euro/m(2) 10 years can be
   expected, but depending on surface material. This is in contrast with an
   approximate European average situation where no change in precipitation
   is expected during the twenty-first century and an increase in
   temperature will result in reduced corrosion of metals due to drying up
   of surfaces and reduced maintenance costs. The maintenance costs for
   Portland limestone surfaces may increase for the European average
   situation due to an increased effect of air pollution on corrosion at
   higher temperature. Reduction in amounts of precipitation is expected in
   southern Europe. This will further reduce corrosion rates and
   maintenance costs for all materials.
   Research limitations/implications - The results reported include the
   uncertainty inherent in climate model scenarios and in the empirically
   derived dose-response functions. Degradation of real building facades
   varies depending on factors such as building design, type of surface
   materials and surface treatments.
   Practical implications - Reduction of air pollutants, monitoring of
   degradation, adjustment of building standards and guidelines, and use of
   more suitable materials and building techniques are some possible
   measures to adapt to increased atmospheric corrosion of buildings caused
   by climate change.
   Social implications - Expected increase in maintenance costs is one
   additional expense for society due to climate change, which can
   contribute to reduced welfare and increased social stress.
   Originality/value - The comparison of expected future degradation and
   cost of maintenance of building facades due to climate change and due to
   change in air pollution makes the practical significance of such changes
   more evident.},

Abstract = {Ocean policies around the world increasingly emphasize the importance of
   maintaining resilient ocean ecosystems, communities, and economies. To
   maintain and restore the resilience of healthy marine ecosystems in
   practice, specific management objectives with metrics and a policy
   framework for how to apply them will be needed. Here we present a
   concept for doing this, based on evidence that marine ecosystems
   transition from desirable to less desirable states in response to a
   number of physical, chemical, and biological drivers. More empirical and
   synthesis research will be necessary to develop quantitative metrics of
   resilience and thresholds between ecosystem states for specific
   ecosystems; however, suggestions are provided here for how to manage for
   resilience when insufficient data and knowledge are available for
   quantification. A summary of thresholds for biotic and abiotic drivers
   of ecosystem state drawn from the literature is also provided as a guide
   to management. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate change indicators dataset for coastal locations of the European

Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Over time, considerable changes in the earth's climate have always
   occurred due to a wide variety of natural processes. During the last
   century, these natural changes have all been accelerated by global
   warming, which has been driven by human activities. Climate change leads
   to wide variations in environmental variables such as temperature,
   relative humidity, carbon dioxide, etc. These changes could adversely
   affect the performance, serviceability, and safety of infrastructure
   assets. The challenge, therefore, is to not only understand the effect
   of extreme events and their links to climate change, but also to obtain
   data that could be used for assessing long-term gradual effects
   affecting infrastructure assets. In this paper is presented a climate
   indicators database that was collected and provided in an excel format.
   This database could be used for assessing the durability, vulnerability,
   and cost-effectiveness of adaptation measures for coastal infrastructure
   assets. The database contains information for specific coastal locations
   placed in five European countries: Caxias (Portugal), Saint Nazaire
   (France), Vigo (Spain), Brighton (UK), Dublin and Cork (Ireland). The
   database includes atmospheric, and oceanic indicators, as well as and
   the flow of rivers. It covers a time series of up to 2100 with various
   representative concentration pathways and climate models. (C) 2022 The

Abstract = {Climate variability and continual occurrence of cyclones, flood and
   storm surge have greater implications on fragile ecosystem of Indian
   Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR). Centurial meteorological data were
   used to assess the climate variability in the Reserve. Multivariate
   principal component analysis was performed to identify the consistency
   among the conditioning parameters of climate. Cyclones, severe cyclone,
   storm surge height, salinity intrusion, pH and surface water temperature
   were assessed to figure out the overall consequences of climate
   variability. Field investigation from 570 households from coastal and
   inland blocks (administrative division of the district) was carried out
   to reaffirm the variability in climatic conditions and its
   environmental, economic and social consequences in SBR. Study revealed
   wide spatiotemporal variation in temperature and rainfall. Rise in sea
   level, flood and high storm surge height and salinity intrusion were
   inducing vulnerability in the coastal blocks. Communities in Gosaba,
   Kultali, Kakdwip, Sagar, Patharpratima and Namkhana blocks largely
   showed high level of agreement for climate variability. Hence, the study
   calls for effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Public participation of the Inuit concerning climate change adaptation
   in the Canadian Arctic is essential, given the extensive knowledge they
   possess about their traditional territories, especially as it relates to
   resources management. Unfortunately, much of this knowledge is not
   incorporated into the tertiary educational system and hence not part of
   the knowledge set of the people most likely to engage in public policy
   discussions and decisions. This article adopts a transdisciplinary
   approach, using an analysis of historic fish and marine mammal catch
   with the marine ecological footprint calculated for the year 2000. This
   scientific data, supported by the principle of free and prior informed
   consent as defined in United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
   Indigenous Peoples as well as the Tsilhqot'in case in Canada,
   demonstrates the need for inclusive education. We conclude that
   indigenous participation in climate change adaptation policies would
   benefit immensely from the offering of university programmes that
   incorporate, in a meaningful way, Inuit traditional knowledge and
   indigenous rights.},

Abstract = {The Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) is the Integrated Ocean
   Observing System (IOOS) Regional Association (RA) responsible for
   coordinating statewide monitoring for Alaska's nearly 44,000 miles of
   coastline and offshore environments. The Alaska coastline is larger than
   that of any other RA territory as well as the combined seaboard of the
   United States (US). It is also the only US regional observing system
   that includes a polar observing component in the Arctic. The effects of
   climate change in Alaska are already evidenced by the steady decline of
   Arctic summer sea ice extent and concentration, increased wildfires,
   thawing permafrost, increasing ocean acidification (OA) and recognizable
   ecosystem shifts. Other concerns include increased marine traffic,
   especially through the Bering Strait and across the Arctic Ocean region,
   ongoing industrial activities, escalating coastal erosion and inundation
   affecting many coastal subsistence communities, and physical and
   biological ramifications from the rapid and dramatic retreat of sea ice
   over the past 30 years. Addressing these changes including mitigation,
   adaptation and management of resources (e.g., fisheries) requires
   sustainable, reliable and accessible marine information from both
   ambient monitoring activities and process oriented research projects.
   The AOOS conceptual build out plan for the Alaskan Arctic prioritizes
   core monitoring platforms and activities for safe marine operations,
   improved storm and hazard response, and integrated data products for
   ecosystem assessments and climate trends. In this paper, we summarize
   how AOOS approaches this mission, and discuss actions currently underway
   in the Arctic, including the ongoing development of the Arctic Data
   Integration Portal.},

Abstract = {The productivity of Arabica coffee in the Gayo Highlands, Aceh,
   Indonesia is far below its potential because of climate change and
   inadequate agricultural practices. To develop a strategy on sustainable
   coffee yield and improvements of smallholder farming systems, we
   investigated coffee productivity in three classes of shade densities and
   three classes of total management intensities index (TMI) along six
   altitude gradients (1,000-1,600m above sea level) over 234 farmers'
   plots. Coffee productivity was significantly affected by altitude, shade
   density, and TMI. Our results showed a stronger positive altitudinal
   effect with coffee productivity in middle and higher altitudes than in
   lower altitudes and were related to shade density and TMI. Increasing
   elevation of coffee plantation from lower to middle altitudes and shade
   from low to medium density increased in coffee productivity but further
   increase to higher altitude seemed to depress coffee productivity.
   Increasing TMI positively increased coffee productivity across
   altitudes. Shade density and TMI played significant roles in coffee
   productivity in lower altitudes; therefore, coffee farmers have to
   increase the shade to medium or higher density and at the same time
   improve plantation management to medium or high TMI.},

Title = {Vulnerability assessment for supporting sustainable coastal city
   development: a case study of La Paz, Mexico},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Pages = {552-565},
Abstract = {Coastal zones and adjacent land areas support 60\% of the human
   population and eight of the top-10 largest cities in the world. These
   regions are exposed to natural hazards and climate-change-induced
   stresses, which requires continuous assessments of their vulnerability
   in many coastal regions around the world. Evaluations and monitoring of
   vulnerability models in coastal areas will assist in formulating
   environmental policies and guiding decision-makers to address the
   central tenets for the sustainable development of coastal cities. Baja
   California Sur (BCS) is the Mexican state with the longest coastline in
   the nation, and its capital city of La Paz is the most crowded city and
   without a vulnerability assessment. In this context, La Paz was
   regionalized based on biotic, natural landscape and socio-economic
   factors within geographic information systems, obtaining 74
   environmental units (EnvUs). Assessment of each unit with a coastal
   vulnerability model involved physical, environmental and socio-economic
   indicators and composed indices which considered three main elements:
   (1) a fixed component defined by Coastal Vulnerability Index; (2) a
   Pressure Index and (3) a Fragility Index. Nearly 38\% of EnvU and over
   60\% of total area showed high and very high fragility, including the
   capital city. Only 7\% of EnvU and 14\% of all the area of interest
   presented high and very high pressure. Nearly a third of EnvU had high
   and very high vulnerability, mainly in La Paz and southwest of the study
   area without actual human pressure, especially due to the presence of
   lower slopes and high-energy streams. Results allow focusing efforts on
   environmental policy instruments to implement adaptation measures for
   sustainable development in the BCS region.},

Abstract = {Escalating pressures caused by the combined effects of population
   growth, demographic shifts, economic development and global climate
   change pose unprecedented threats to sandy beach ecosystems worldwide.
   Conservation of beaches as functional ecosystems and protection of their
   unique biodiversity requires management interventions that not only
   mitigate threats to physical properties of sandy shores, but also
   include ecological dimensions. Yet, beach management remains
   overwhelmingly focused on engineering interventions. Here we summarise
   the key outcomes of several workshops, held during the 2006 Sandy Beach
   Ecology Symposium in Vigo, Spain, that addressed issues of climate
   change, beach management and sampling methodology. Because efficient
   communication between managers and ecologists is critical, we summarise
   the salient features of sandy beaches as functional ecosystems in 50
   `key statements'; these provide a succinct synopsis of the main
   structural and functional characteristics of these highly dynamic
   systems. Key outcomes of the workshops include a set of recommendations
   on designs and methods for sampling the benthic infaunal communities of
   beaches, the identification of the main ecological effects caused by
   direct and indirect human interventions, the predicted consequence of
   climate change for beach ecosystems, and priority areas for future
   research.},

Abstract = {We investigated the effect of environmental conditions on Atlantic
   mackerel spawning habitat in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL).
   Based on generalized additive models, we (i) modelled the optimal
   spawning habitat of mackerel in the sGSL using daily egg production
   (DEP) in June, (ii) predicted known and new potential present spawning
   habitats in the GSL and the north-west Atlantic, and (iii) assessed how
   they respond to future climate change. Our findings showed that both
   mackerel presence-absence and given-presence DEP were associated with
   sea surface temperature (10-16.5 degrees C), salinity above 31 and depth
   < 120 m. Adding zooplankton showed a marked effect on the DEP
   given-presence compared to the presence-absence. Predictions of spawning
   habitats under present (1999-2012) and future scenario (2066-2085)
   conditions were estimated from the presence-absence model without
   zooplankton, using physical conditions of the BNAM. Under present
   conditions, our model predicted well the main spawning habitat in the
   sGSL and other known secondary spawning habitats in the northern GSL
   (nGSL), the western and southern Newfoundland, and the north-west
   Atlantic coast. Under future conditions, our study suggests that
   spawning habitats in the sGSL and the nGSL would expand. Our results,
   therefore, suggest that mackerel could benefit from a warmer GSL,
   minimizing the potential for a northward migration of the stock due to
   decreasing suitability of the sGSL as its main spawning ground, and a
   new but spatially limited potential habitat in Newfoundland coasts.
   These results can be used to inform stock management and develop
   adaptive management plans in the context of climate change.},

Abstract = {Coastal-water hypoxia is increasing globally due to global warming and
   urbanization, and the need to define management solutions to improve the
   water quality of coastal ecosystems has become important. The lower
   tidal Garonne River (TGR; southwestern France), characterized by the
   seasonal presence of a turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) and urban water
   discharge, is subject to episodic hypoxia events during low river flow
   periods in the summer. Future climatic conditions (higher temperature
   and summer droughts) and increasing urbanization could enhance hypoxia
   risks near the city of Bordeaux in the coming decades. A 3-D model of
   dissolved oxygen (DO) that couples hydrodynamics, sediment transport and
   biogeochemical processes was used to assess the efficiency of different
   management solutions for oxygenation of the TGR during summer
   low-discharge periods. We ran different scenarios of reductions in urban
   sewage overflows, displacement of urban discharges downstream from
   Bordeaux and/or temporary river flow support during the summer period.
   The model shows that each option mitigates hypoxia, but with variable
   efficiency over time and space. Sewage overflow reduction improves DO
   levels only locally near the city of Bordeaux. Downstream relocation of
   wastewater discharges allows for better oxygenation levels in the lower
   TGR. The support of low river flow limits the upstream TMZ propagation
   and dilutes the TGR water with well-oxygenated river water. Scenarios
   combining wastewater network management and low-water replenishment
   indicate an improvement in water quality over the entire TGR. These
   modelling outcomes constitute important tools for local water
   authorities to develop the most appropriate strategies to limit hypoxia
   in the TGR.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to set-up the basis for climate change
   adaptation of water resources management policies in Seyhan River basin.
   The first priority was to identify the balances between water resources
   and water users with respect to existing and planned projects. In this
   respect various aspects of Seyhan basin were evaluated, including
   evaluation of existing water resources, determination of water demand of
   existing and planned projects, and water resources supply-demand
   characteristics. The global climate change model was downscaled to the
   basin scale, the results were associated with hydrometeorological
   monitoring network and finally the impact of climate change on surface
   water resources and demands were determined for specific projection
   years. Water resources management scenarios were developed to evaluate
   adaptation alternatives to climate change scenarios at the basin level.
   It was determined that even though there was no water stress in Seyhan
   basin in 2010, many parts of the basin were expected to suffer
   significant shortages over the coming years.},

Abstract = {Several decades of research has produced considerable understanding of
   the complex and interacting factors contributing to the construction of
   social vulnerability to natural hazards. However, natural hazards remain
   a considerable challenge to poverty reduction and development in many
   countries around the world and particularly in South and Southeast Asia.
   The objective of this paper is to undertake a comprehensive systematic
   analysis of the scientific literature on coastal hazards to identify the
   factors contributing to hazard vulnerability, to determine the
   relationships between them, and to review recommendations for
   vulnerability reduction. With the employment of meta-analysis
   methodology, 361 social-economic impacting factors to vulnerability are
   determined, as well as the complex causal relationship between them.
   Combined with the analysis on the current popular recommendations in the
   literature, some important insights into the gaps between the driving
   factors and the coping policy and measures are concluded.},

Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has become a major concern for
   city sustainability in the wake of global warming and rapid
   urbanization. This has resulted in increased heat stress and worsened
   outdoor thermal comfort in urban microclimates. The study demonstrated
   that outdoor thermal stress pedestrians can be reduced in single streets
   by adopting mitigation strategies, that is, cool materials, vegetation,
   and water bodies. In this article, computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   simulations using URANS modeling for four different scenarios have been
   performed to investigate the effectiveness of different mitigation
   measures in hot, humid urban climates conditions. The reduction of
   ambient air temperature and surface temperature characterizing the
   mitigation (cooling) intensity is examined at pedestrian height and
   diverse vertical levels. The analysis shows that on its own, water
   provides the largest reduction in air temperature at pedestrian height
   (2 degrees C), and cool materials provide a larger reduction in surface
   temperature (6 degrees C). When applied individually, cool materials are
   the more effective in the vertical direction with a UHI mitigation
   intensity of 1.5 degrees C, followed by vegetation, with a mitigation
   intensity of 1.0 degrees C. Furthermore, the impact (temperature
   reduction) is more significant when all three measures are combined,
   with a large reduction of 2 degrees C in air temperature and 9 degrees C
   in surface temperature observed compared to the reference case.},

Abstract = {Understanding the barriers that inhibit the deployment of renewable
   energy technologies to achieve long-term reductions in carbon emissions
   from the use of fossil fuels is paramount to Barbados. Although there
   are targets towards renewable energy (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal)
   uptake, the share of these technologies in the energy mix does not exist
   in Barbados due to the total dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper,
   a review of potential challenges and the main problems for deployment of
   alternative energy sources is presented. Through interviews,
   questionnaires with a focus group of key personnel's, the paper
   documents the lack of renewable energy sources (with emphasis on solar
   energy) as one of the main alternatives to meet the carbon emission
   targets set by the country. The barriers and challenges facing the
   implementation of solar energy deployment have been clarified. From the
   results, it is evident that significant policy barriers still exist at
   the country level, which has reduced the effectiveness of a concerted
   national effort to deploy renewables. The current policy landscape which
   benefits from fossil fuel imports, the lack of technical know-how and
   the lack of research and development in the renewable energy space are
   amongst the key barriers identified. The paper also outlines the key
   policy's frameworks, regulatory environment and the lack of incentives,
   which encompasses the renewable energy sector, and presents a critical
   analysis of the barriers faced by the industry. A mitigation framework
   is proposed to bridge the gap of solar energy (renewable energy)
   deployment.},

Abstract = {The 2015-2016 El Nino provided insight into how low-inflow estuaries
   might respond to future climate regimes, including high sea levels and
   more intense waves. High waves and water levels coupled with low
   rainfall along the Southern California coastline provided the
   opportunity to examine how extreme ocean forcing impacts estuaries
   independently from fluvial events. From November 2015 to April 2016,
   water levels were measured in 13 Southern California estuaries,
   including both intermittently closed and perennially open estuaries with
   varying watershed size, urban development, and management practices.
   Elevated ocean water levels caused raised water levels and prolonged
   inundation in all of the estuaries studied. Water levels inside
   perennially open estuaries mirrored ocean water levels, while those
   inside intermittently closed estuaries (ICEs) exhibited enhanced
   higher-high water levels during large waves, and tides were truncated at
   low tides due to a wave-built sand sill at the mouth, resulting in
   elevated detided water levels. ICEs closed when sufficient wave-driven
   sand accretion formed a barrier berm across the mouth separating the
   estuary from the ocean, the height of which can be estimated using
   estuarine lower-low water levels. During the 2015-2016 El Nino, a
   greater number of Southern California ICEs closed than during a typical
   year and ICEs that close annually experienced longer than normal
   closures. Overall, sill accretion and wave exposure were important
   contributing factors to individual estuarine response to ocean
   conditions. Understanding how estuaries respond to increased sea levels
   and waves and the factors that influence closures will help managers
   develop appropriate adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Formulating a 100-year strategy for managing coastal hazard risk in a

Abstract = {Decision-makers, managers and communities in low-lying coastal regions
   face many challenges in planning for and adapting to escalating coastal
   hazard risk, given uncertainty about sea-level rise and complex and
   contested environmental and socio-economic futures. Collaborative and
   participatory approaches can help to address such challenges and enable
   proactive adaptation. However, there is limited empirical evidence of
   such approaches yielding outcomes that can genuinely be described as
   shifting business as usual, and fewer still that have informed
   institutional change. This paper provides such evidence based on an
   assessment of a novel collaboration between local government, Ma over
   bar ori, stakeholders, community members, consultants and researchers in
   the formulation of a 100-year coastal hazard management strategy in
   Aotearoa New Zealand. Thematic analysis of interviews, surveys and
   workshop materials was used to distil lessons learned by participants
   involved in formulating this anticipatory long-term strategy. Results
   indicated the importance of deliberative, flexible and transparent
   governance processes that can enable collaboration amongst Ma over bar
   ori, local and region-wide stakeholders, in a process consistent with
   and supported by the national governmental frameworks, and regulatory
   and non-regulatory measures. The importance of aligning scientific,
   local and Indigenous knowledges is highlighted. Furthermore, novel tools
   and methodologies were used in the strategy formulation process,
   hitherto not applied in a real-life coastal decision-making process, to
   address changing risk over time and uncertainties. This enabled the
   tailoring of strategic planning and decision processes to reflect local
   contexts and governance interactions. Adaptive pathways were developed
   to enable short-term actions to be taken while leaving open longterm
   options and alternative pathways available for future adjustment as the
   hazards and impacts intensify. The lessons learned from the development
   of the coastal management strategy offer insights to support future
   collaborative decision-making processes in climate change adaptation.
   They advance scholarly understanding about how sea-level rise risks can
   be addressed in a long-term strategic formulation process in a dynamic
   and `fitfor-purpose' manner.},

Title = {From grey to green: Efficacy of eco-engineering solutions for

Abstract = {Climate change is increasing the threat of erosion and flooding along
   coastlines globally. Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and
   breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and
   associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and
   ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or
   restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves,
   seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide
   coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures.
   Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding
   coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most
   appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal
   defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to
   artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence
   for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and
   discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats
   created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in
   comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental
   conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all
   ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in
   addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among
   scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the
   experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline
   protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to
   artificial structures. This research needs to happen now as our rapidly
   changing climate requires new and innovative solutions to reduce the
   vulnerability of coastal communities to an increasingly uncertain
   future.},

Abstract = {Up-to-date regional and local assessments of changing climate extremes
   are important to allow countries to make informed decisions on
   mitigation and adaptation strategies, and to put these changes into a
   global context. A workshop for countries from the Indo-Pacific region
   has brought together daily observations from 13 countries for an
   analysis of climate extremes between 1971 and 2005. This paper makes use
   of the workshop outcomes and post-workshop analyses to build on previous
   work in Southeast Asia to update the assessment of changing climate
   extremes using newly available station data. We utilise a consistent and
   widely tested methodology to allow a direct comparison of the results
   with those from other parts of the world. The relationship of
   inter-annual variability in the climate extremes indices with sea
   surface temperature (SST) patterns has been investigated with a focus on
   the influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The
   results support findings from elsewhere around the globe that warm
   extremes, particularly at night, are increasing and cold extremes are
   decreasing. Trends in precipitation extremes are less spatially
   consistent across the region. (c) Royal Meteorological Society and Crown

Abstract = {Climate change is a major threat to mangrove ecosystems worldwide but
   particularly those in arid regions that exist near the limit of
   tolerance to extremes in temperature, precipitation, and salinity. Here
   we examine Persian Gulf arid mangrove ecosystems from the Nayband and
   Mond Protected Area in the south-west region of Iran to determine the
   ability of tidal mangrove forests to respond to rapid urban and
   industrial development, sea-level rise (SLR), and temperature and
   precipitation changes. Sea level has been rising by approximately 4 mm
   yr(-1) in this region and might be intensified by subsidence on the
   order of 1-2 mm yr(-1) due to natural phenomena as well as anthropogenic
   activities associated with fluid extraction. We use remote sensing along
   with statistical analysis to effectively monitor mangrove area changes
   over 60 years and infer responses to past environmental trends. Our
   spatiotemporal analysis demonstrates expansion in some areas and
   reduction in others. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
   results indicate that Nayband mangroves are healthy and expanded between
   the years of 1990 and 2002 which could be in response to rising
   temperatures and above-average precipitation. However, NDVI changes
   after 2002 demonstrate the mangrove health and area have decreased which
   could be in response to industrial and urban development that occurred
   immediately after 1997. The natural stresses in this extreme system are
   been exacerbated by climate change and anthropogenic pressures as such
   it is essential to develop ways to reduce vulnerability through
   strategic management planning. (C) 2020 Institute of Oceanology of the

Title = {Analytics with digital-twinning: A decision support system for
   maintaining a resilient port},
Journal = {DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {143},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper, a Decision Support System (DSS) with digital
   twinning-based resilience analysis is proposed as a modern tool for port
   resilience computation and updating. The proposed DSS assesses the
   resilience of a port under possible disruptive events given its design,
   operations and potential pre-defined post-event recovery actions to
   mitigate the impact of the disruption. Digital twinning provides the
   fidelity required to realistically predict port performance with taken
   post-event recovery actions under various possible disruptive events. In
   addition to hedging against impacts from probabilistically known
   disruption events, this approach also enables inclusion of ordinary
   operational uncertainties within the resilience evaluation. This is not
   generally feasible with other existing resilience quantification
   approaches. To tackle computational challenges of applying a digital
   twin for real-world size applications, an optimal computing budget
   allocation policy is adopted to improve computational efficiency.
   Results of numerical experiments using a real-world size port
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSS and criticality of
   accounting for ordinary uncertainties in operations in resilience
   estimation.},

   affective engagement with the Great Barrier Reef climate change issue,
   but that behavioural engagement was limited by objective constraints
   that intervene between individuals' desire to become engaged (affective
   engagement) and their ability to take relevant actions. Individuals were
   constrained from increasing their engagement with the Great Barrier Reef
   climate change issue primarily by lack of knowledge about actions they
   can take, lack of time, and having other priorities. Individuals' age,
   gender, education level, income, and place of residence influenced the
   probability that they would experience these and other specific
   constraints on engagement. We suggest that future Great Barrier Reef
   engagement strategies must endeavour to identify specific behaviour that
   individuals can undertake to help reduce the impact of climate change on
   the reef, and find ways to help people overcome the constraints they
   face on engagement in those activities. The theoretical framework we
   developed should be useful for investigating constraints on engagement
   with other environmental issues, but further empirical and conceptual
   work is necessary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing the conservation values and tourism threats in Barrientos
   Island, Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {266},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Antarctica has been witnessing continued growth of tourism, both in the
   overall visitation and in the diversity of itineraries and visitor
   activities. Expanding tourism presents unique business and educational
   opportunities, but it is also putting immense pressure on Antarctica's
   natural, and for the most parts, pristine environment. Understanding the
   effectiveness of different tourism management strategies and
   instruments, like the Visitor Site Guidelines adopted by the Antarctic
   Treaty, is fundamental to the sustainable management of Antarctic
   tourism. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of
   Visitor Site Guidelines and other tourism management actions in reducing
   impacts to the natural environment and for this, we used Barrientos
   Island as our case study as this is one of the most popular sites for
   tourism activities in the Antarctic Peninsula Region. First, we
   conducted a literature review and biological inventories to enable a
   thorough description of Barrientos Island's ecological values. The
   results show that Barrientos Island occupies the third highest
   biological richness among the top 15 most visited sites in the Antarctic
   Peninsula Region. We then assessed how tourism use on Barrientos Island
   affected biodiversity and the environment, and how Visitor Site
   Guidelines and other management measures helped alleviate these impacts.
   As intended, these instruments has been positive and valuable by
   providing operational guidance. However, they may lack significant
   information for tourism decision-making processes. To this end, we
   propose an alternative adaptive management approach that can more
   efficiently conserve biodiversity and environmental values while
   allowing the development of sustainable tourism activities in
   Antarctica.},

Title = {Climate Change in Fisheries and Aquaculture: Analysis of the Impact
   Caused by Idai and Kenneth Cyclones in Mozambique},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Fisheries and Aquaculture are among the most popular activities in
   coastal regions of the world. In addition, both correspond to high-risk
   activities within a climate change context as they are vulnerable to
   environmental changes that threaten the socio-economic sustainability of
   the fishing communities that depend on fish for food security and income
   generation. In 2019, the central part of Mozambique was hit by two
   unprecedented cyclones: Idai and Kenneth that killed over 600 people and
   left nearly 2.2 million people in need of urgent assistance. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate the impacts these cyclones had on
   fisheries and aquaculture in the provinces of Sofala and Zambezia in
   Mozambique. The study further seeks to propose strategies that could be
   adopted by the communities to minimize the risks in the future. For the
   construction of the database, both secondary and primary data collection
   approaches were used to characterize the cyclone events. Secondary data
   was collected through sector reports and previously published articles,
   while primary data was collected through interviews with fishers, sector
   employees, and aquaculture producers in the affected provinces. The
   results revealed that these natural events had both a direct and
   indirect impact on fishing, as they affected more than 1,440 fishermen
   that lost 590 vessels, 1,800 fishing gear, and 67 boat engines in Sofala
   province. In Zambezia province, aquaculture producers lost 169 fish
   ponds, two cages, and 606,000 lost fry, while in Sofala province, 58
   fish tanks, 204 cages, and 257,500 fish fry were lost. Overall, our
   study reveals the vulnerability of fisheries and aquaculture to extreme
   events particularly the cyclones in Mozambique. Lack of knowledge
   regarding climate change, advanced preventive measures, and poor
   adaptive capacity makes the sectors more vulnerable to disasters.
   Therefore, it is recommended to improve awareness programs, introduce
   measures and policies that promote resilience and optimum adaptive
   efficiency.},

Abstract = {Elevated urban temperatures and heatwaves are a serious threat to the
   health and wellbeing of the continuously growing urban population and
   are projected to worsen under climate change. For this reason
   well-informed disaster risk reduction (DRR) actions, where science and
   technology play a key role, are required. However insufficient
   communication between scientific and policy-making communities (known as
   the science-policy gap) hampers the use of science in DRR. Hence there
   is a strong need to interpret existing scientific knowledge into
   actionable knowledge, i.e. science that is useful, usable and used. This
   article presents a series of services and tools that build-upon existing
   scientific knowledge and aim to provide actionable knowledge to
   authorities and citizens for reducing the risks of elevated urban
   temperatures. The above were implemented in the context of the European
   Commission's Thermal Risk rEduction Actions and tools for secURE cities
   (TREASURE) project, and address many of the goals and priorities for
   action set in the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR)
   of the United Nations. A key policy-making user of the implemented
   services and tools is the City of Athens in Greece, which is one of the
   largest metropolitan areas in Europe.},

Title = {Misperceptions of climate-change risk as barriers to climate-change
   adaptation: a case study from the Rewa Delta, Fiji},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {110},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {169-186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While increasing research is focusing on the effective adaptation to
   climate change in richer (developed) countries, comparatively little has
   focused specifically on this subject in poorer (developing) countries
   such as most in the Pacific Islands region. A significant barrier to the
   development of effective and sustainable adaptive strategies for climate
   change in such places is the gap between risk and perceived risk. This
   study looks at a vulnerable location in Fiji-the densely populated Rewa
   River Delta where environmental changes resulting from shoreline retreat
   and floods are expected to increase over the next few decades and entail
   profound societal disruption. The numbers of people living in the Rewa
   Delta who know of climate change and could correctly identify its
   contributory causes are few although many rank its current
   manifestations (floods, riverbank erosion, groundwater salinization) as
   among their most serious environmental challenges. While lack of
   awareness is a barrier to adaptation, there are also cultural
   impediments to this such as short-term planning perspectives, spiritual
   beliefs, traditional governance structures. One way forward is to
   empower community leaders in places like the Rewa Delta to make
   appropriate decisions and for regional governments to continue working
   together to find solutions that acknowledge the variation in
   sub-regional trans-national vulnerability to climate change.},

Abstract = {Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a light-driven proton pump that is found in
   diverse bacteria and archaea species, and is widespread in marine
   microbial ecosystems. To date, many studies have suggested the advantage
   of PR for microorganisms in sunlit environments. The ecophysiological
   significance of PR is still not fully understood however, including the
   drivers of PR gene gain, retention, and loss in different marine
   microbial species. To explore this question we sequenced 21 marine
   Flavobacteriia genomes of polyphyletic origin, which encompassed both
   PR-possessing as well as PR-lacking strains. Here, we show that the
   possession or alternatively the lack of PR genes reflects one of two
   fundamental adaptive strategies in marine bacteria. Specifically, while
   PR-possessing bacteria utilize light energy ({''}solar-panel
   strategy{''}), PR-lacking bacteria exclusively possess UV-screening
   pigment synthesis genes to avoid UV damage and would adapt to
   microaerobic environment ({''}parasol strategy{''}), which also helps
   explain why PR-possessing bacteria have smaller genomes than those of
   PR-lacking bacteria. Collectively, our results highlight the different
   strategies of dealing with light, DNA repair, and oxygen availability
   that relate to the presence or absence of PR phototrophy.},

Title = {Managing moose harvests by the seat of your pants},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},

Pages = {340-347},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Moose populations are managed for sustainable yield balanced against
   costs caused by damage to forestry or agriculture and collisions with
   vehicles. Optimal harvests can be calculated based on a structured
   population model driven by data on abundance and the composition of
   bulls, cows, and calves obtained by aerial-survey monitoring during
   winter. Quotas are established by the respective government agency and
   licenses are issued to hunters to harvest an animal of specified age or
   sex during the following autumn. Because the cost of aerial monitoring
   is high, we use a Management Strategy Evaluation to evaluate the costs
   and benefits of periodic aerial surveys in the context of moose
   management. Our on-the-fly ``seat of your pants{''} alternative to
   independent monitoring is management based solely on the kill of moose
   by hunters, which is usually sufficient to alert the manager to declines
   in moose abundance that warrant adjustments to harvest strategies.
   Harvests are relatively cheap to monitor; therefore, data can be
   obtained each year facilitating annual adjustments to quotas. Other
   sources of ``cheap{''} monitoring data such as records of the number of
   moose seen by hunters while hunting also might be obtained, and may
   provide further useful insight into population abundance, structure and
   health. Because conservation dollars are usually limited, the high cost
   of aerial surveys is difficult to justify when alternative methods
   exist. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Eroding Land and Erasing Place: A Qualitative Study of Place Attachment,
   Risk Perception, and Coastal Land Loss in Southern Louisiana},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Southern Louisiana and its coastal bayous are sites of both frequent
   flooding and rapid coastal land loss, exacerbated by the increasing
   effects of climate change. Though much work has examined flood risk
   perceptions in coastal areas, few studies have considered the
   qualitative and contextual dimensions of perceptions of coastal land
   loss and its associated impacts, and how these perceptions relate to
   local culture, place, and intentions to mitigate personal exposure to
   risk. We conducted six focus groups in areas with distinct exposure to
   coastal land loss. Participants expressed strong attachment to
   community, culture, and place. Personal ties to land loss through family
   or social connections, experiences with fishing and water-based
   activities, and indirect impacts on Louisiana's seafood industry and
   cuisine provided a lens for understanding the immediate impacts of
   coastal land loss. Participants felt that exposure to the risks of land
   loss was inevitable and that mitigation was beyond individual efforts, a
   feeling that manifested both as pessimism and as a resilient focus on
   collective action. Considering state history with political corruption,
   participants generally distrusted state-level mitigation initiatives.
   These findings shed light on the qualitative dimensions of coastal land
   loss perceptions in southern Louisiana and their relation to place
   attachment, mitigation intentions, and sources of risk information.
   While participants with personal ties to risk report feelings of
   exposure and inevitability, they are also embedded in communities with
   strong ties to place. This nuance only complicates the meanings that
   individuals associate with land loss and the actions that they are
   motivated to take; impacts of coastal land loss on the landscape and
   distinct place characteristics of southern Louisiana may lead to
   significant disruption to identity and well-being, but also provide a
   pathway for risk awareness and potential motivation of collective
   mitigation actions.},

Abstract = {The management of indigenous conifer forests in Westland, South Island,
   New Zealand has focussed largely on harvest of the Podocarpaceac tree
   rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum). Today, key management objectives are to
   maintain the pre-harvested state of the forest in terms of biomass, tree
   size ranges (especially old trees), natural spatial patterns, relative
   proportions of the major tree species, and forest timber quality. This
   approach to natural forest management is based on utilizing heavy-lift
   helicopters, pre-empting mortality by harvest of a proportion of single
   unthrifty rimu trees, and an auditable GPS-based forest record system. A
   transition matrix model is used to determine the expected natural
   mortality rate and the sustainable harvest is based on pre-empting a
   proportion of the mortality over a 15-year felling cycle. Trees with
   significant wildlife features (e.g. cavities and large epiphyte loads)
   are not harvested, Even natural forest management can impact ecological
   processes through loss of senile trees, pre-empting forest tree
   windfall. altering spatial patterns of forest structure and facilitating
   pest and weed spread. However, because of the dynamic nature of these
   forest environments, the impact of forestry should be insignificant over
   major natural disturbance events. The best way to ensure that key
   management objectives are realized is to adopt an adaptive management
   approach that involves regularly monitoring of key forest attributes and
   frequent recalculation of the sustainable harvest model. (C) 2002

Title = {Costs and Opportunities for Preserving Coastal Wetlands under Sea Level
   Rise},
Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-57},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {Rises in sea level can alter the distribution of coastal wetlands
   through migration landward and loss due to inundation. The expansion of
   coastal developments can prevent potential wetland migration,
   exacerbating loss as sea levels rise. Pre-emptive planning to set aside
   key coastal areas for wetland migration is therefore critical for the
   long-term preservation of species habitat and ecosystem services, yet we
   have little understanding of the economic costs and benefits of doing
   so. Using data and simulations from Queensland, Australia, we show that
   the opportunity cost of preserving wetlands is likely to be much higher
   under sea level rise than under current sea levels. However, we find
   that payments for ecosystem services can alleviate these costs, and in
   many cases may make expanding the reserve network profitable in the long
   run. This highlights the need to develop markets and payment mechanisms
   for ecosystem services to support climate change adaptation policies for
   coastal wetlands.},

Title = {Regional scenarios of sea level rise and impacts on Basque (Bay of

Abstract = {Global climate models have predicted a rise on mean sea level of between
   0.18 m and 0.59 m by the end of the 21 st Century, with high regional
   variability. The objectives of this study are to estimate sea level
   changes in the Bay of Biscay during this century, and to assess the
   impacts of any change on Basque coastal habitats and infrastructures.
   Hence, ocean temperature projections for three climate scenarios,
   provided by several atmosphere-ocean coupled general climate models,
   have been extracted for the Bay of Biscay: these are used to estimate
   thermosteric sea level variations. The results show that, from 2001 to
   2099, sea level within the Bay of Biscay will increase by between 28.5
   and 48.7 cm, as a result of regional thermal expansion and global
   ice-melting, under scenarios A1B and A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change. A high-resolution digital terrain model, extracted
   from LiDAR, data was used to evaluate the potential impact of the
   estimated sea level rise to 9 coastal and estuarine habitats: sandy
   beaches and muds, vegetated dunes, shingle beaches, sea cliffs and
   supralittoral rock, wetlands and saltmarshes, terrestrial habitats,
   artificial land, piers, and water surfaces. The projected sea level rise
   of 48.7 cm was added to the high tide level of the coast studied, to
   generate a flood risk map of the coastal and estuarine areas. The
   results indicate that 110.8 ha of the supralittoral area will be
   affected by the end of the 21 st Century; these are concentrated within
   the estuaries, with terrestrial and artificial habitats being the most
   affected. Sandy beaches are expected to undergo mean shoreline retreats
   of between 25\% and 40\%, of their width. The risk assessment of the
   areas and habitats that will be affected, as a consequence of the sea
   level rise, is potentially useful for local management to adopt
   adaptation measures to global climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Policies for agricultural nitrogen management-trends, challenges and
   prospects for improved efficiency in Denmark},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With more than 60\% of the land farmed, with vulnerable freshwater and
   marine environments, and with one of the most intensive, export-oriented
   livestock sectors in the world, the nitrogen (N) pollution pressure from
   Danish agriculture is severe. Consequently, a series of policy action
   plans have been implemented since the mid 1980s with significant effects
   on the surplus, efficiency and environmental loadings of N. This paper
   reviews the policies and actions taken and their ability to mitigate
   effects of reactive N (N-r) while maintaining agricultural production.
   In summary, the average N-surplus has been reduced from approximately
   170 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) to below 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) during the past
   30 yrs, while the overall N-efficiency for the agricultural sector (crop
   + livestock farming) has increased from around 20-30\% to 40-45\%, the
   N-leaching from the field root zone has been halved, and N losses to the
   aquatic and atmospheric environment have been significantly reduced.
   This has been achieved through a combination of approaches and measures
   (ranging from command and control legislation, over market-based
   regulation and governmental expenditure to information and voluntary
   action), with specific measures addressing the whole N cascade, in order
   to improve the quality of ground-and surface waters, and to reduce the
   deposition to terrestrial natural ecosystems. However, there is still a
   major challenge in complying with the EU Water Framework and Habitats
   Directives, calling for new approaches, measures and technologies to
   mitigate agricultural N losses and control N flows.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Mass blooms and stranding of pelagic Sargassum spp. in the Atlantic,
   termed Sargassum events are becoming more frequent in response to
   several factors: nutrient enrichment, increased temperature, changes in
   climatological patterns, but some causes remain unknown. The magnitude
   of Sargassum events in the Caribbean Sea since 2011 make us aware of the
   necessity to tackle these events, and macroalgal blooms generally, not
   only locally but on a regional scale. At least three pelagic species of
   Sargassum have been dominant in the blooms that have occurred along
   Caribbean coastlines in great quantities. Due to the regional scale of
   these events and its complexity, its management should be based on basic
   and applied information generated by different collaborative actors
   (national and international) through interdisciplinary and
   transdisciplinary work. To address this, we propose different phases
   (exploratory, valorization, and management) and the approach for their
   study should include detection, collection, stabilization and
   experimentation. This information will help identify the potential
   applications and/or ecological services to develop for the exploitation
   and mitigation strategies in the region. Relevant challenges and
   opportunities are discussed, remarking on the necessity to evaluate the
   spatiotemporal variation in the abundance and chemical composition of
   floating and stranded biomass. The above-mentioned will provide
   management strategies and economic opportunities as possible solutions
   to their extensive impact in the Caribbean.},

Title = {Large variability in organic carbon and CaCO3 burial in seagrass

Volume = {616},

Abstract = {Blue carbon refers to the carbon accumulation capacity of vegetated
   coastal habitats, including salt marshes, mangroves forests and seagrass
   meadows. Here we present estimates of organic carbon (C-org) and calcium
   carbonate (CaCO3) burial rates from 4 seagrass species (Halophila
   ovalis, Posidonia australis, Ruppia megacarpa, Zostera muelleri) in 3
   temperate estuaries on the east coast of Australia. The C-org burial
   rates (mean +/- SE) varied by an order of magnitude across the seagrass
   communities (16 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 40 g m(-2) yr(-1)). The delta C-13(org)
   and C-org:N ratios suggest that the seagrass communities buried variable
   mixtures of seagrass, algal and mangrove/terrestrial material. CaCO3
   burial rates ranged from 15 +/- 11 to 188 +/- 122 g m(-2) yr(-1), which,
   if precipitated by calcifying organisms in these or nearby habitats, may
   offset up to 89\% of the C-org burial across the 8 seagrass communities.
   Our results highlight a large range in both C-org and CaCO3 burial
   rates, and the provenance of the carbon sequestered in seagrasses,
   factors that need to be considered when assessing the role of seagrasses
   in blue carbon and climate change mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Florida scrub-jays Aphelocoma coerulescens are listed as threatened
   under the Endangered Species Act due to loss and degradation of scrub
   habitat. This study concerned the development of an optimal strategy for
   the restoration and management of scrub habitat at Merritt Island
   National Wildlife Refuge, which contains one of the few remaining large
   populations of scrub-jays in Florida. There are documented differences
   in the reproductive and survival rates of scrub-jays among discrete
   classes of scrub height (<120 cm or ``short{''}; 120-170 cm or
   ``optimal{''}; >170 cm or ``tall{''}; and a combination of tall and
   optimal or ``mixed{''}), and our objective was to calculate a
   state-dependent management strategy that would maximize the long-term
   growth rate of the resident scrub-jay population. We used aerial imagery
   with multistate Markov models to estimate annual transition
   probabilities among the four scrub-height classes under three possible
   management actions: scrub restoration (mechanical cutting followed by
   burning), a prescribed burn, or no intervention. A strategy prescribing
   the optimal management action for management units exhibiting different
   proportions of scrub-height classes was derived using dynamic
   programming. Scrub restoration was the optimal management action only in
   units dominated by mixed and tall scrub, and burning tended to be the
   optimal action for intermediate levels of short scrub. The optimal
   action was to do nothing when the amount of short scrub was greater than
   30\%, because short scrub mostly transitions to optimal height scrub
   (i.e., that state with the highest demographic success of scrub-jays) in
   the absence of intervention. Monte Carlo simulation of the optimal
   policy suggested that some form of management would be required every
   year. We note, however, that estimates of scrub-height transition
   probabilities were subject to several sources of uncertainty, and so we
   explored the management implications of alternative sets of transition
   probabilities. Generally, our analysis demonstrated the difficulty of
   managing for a species that requires midsuccessional habitat, and
   suggests that innovative management tools may be needed to help ensure
   the persistence of scrub-jays at Merritt Island National Wildlife
   Refuge. The development of a tailored monitoring program as a component
   of adaptive management could help reduce uncertainty about controlled
   and uncontrolled variation in transition probabilities of scrub-height
   and thus lead to improved decision making.},

Title = {The macroeconomic effects of adapting to high-end sea-level rise via
   protection and migration},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) is projected to be
   substantial, triggering human adaptation responses, including increasing
   protection and out-migration from coastlines. Yet, in macroeconomic
   assessments of SLR the latter option has been given little attention. We
   fill this gap by providing a global analysis of the macroeconomic
   effects of adaptation to SLR, including coastal migration, focusing on
   the higher end of SLR projections until 2050. We find that when adapting
   simultaneously via protection and coastal migration, macroeconomic costs
   can be lower than with protection alone. For some developing regions
   coastal migration is even less costly (in GDP) than protection.
   Additionally, we find that future macroeconomic costs are dominated by
   accumulated macroeconomic effects over time, rather than by future
   direct damages, implying the need for immediate adaptation. Finally, we
   demonstrate the importance of including autonomous adaptation in the
   reference scenario of economic assessment studies to avoid
   overestimation of adaptation benefits.
   The authors calculated the economy-wide costs of sea level rise and
   possible adaptation options. Protection clearly pays off and when
   combining protection and coastal migration, costs can be brought down
   further, yet, residual damage costs are large.},

Abstract = {Integrated assessment tools are used ever more frequently for solving
   new environmental, social, and economic challenges related to
   agriculture sustainability. This is particularly relevant in
   ecologically vulnerable areas, where mitigation options include a
   complete redefinition of farming systems. This paper presents an
   assessment of mitigation options of a coastal agricultural watershed
   affected by algal proliferations (Lieue de Greve, western France).
   We developed a methodology based on two existing assessment approaches,
   an agrarian system diagnosis and an environmental assessment, to
   identify connections between farming systems and risky
   nitrogen-agricultural practices and to explore potential ways to reduce
   the environmental impact of farms while respecting their economic
   viability and technical feasibility. To understand the functioning of
   farming systems and calculate key indicators of economic performance,
   the agrarian system diagnosis combines landscape, historical, and
   techno-economic aspects of a farm. The environmental assessment includes
   (i) calculation of farm-gate nitrogen (N) budgets and N-use efficiency
   and (ii) use of a spatially explicit biophysical model, which simulates
   the effect of agricultural practices on water and N dynamics at the
   watershed scale and on N fluxes at the outlet.
   At the farm scale, the main outputs of the approach were (i) the
   identification of 11 farming-system types and factors influencing them
   in the past and present, (ii) the assessment of their techno-economic
   performances and (iii) for the main dairy systems, the assessment of
   their potential environmental impacts. Insights about the capacity of
   some systems to adapt to new constraints linked with environmental
   objectives were also brought out. Grass-based systems appeared to be the
   best alternative for existing farming systems since they display good
   economic results while limiting N emission risks.
   Scenarios of changes in agricultural practices at the watershed scale
   were tested with the biophysical model, comparing them to a reference
   scenario based on the continuation of current agricultural practices.
   The main results indicated that: (i) current water quality was in
   equilibrium with current agricultural practices, (ii) the response time
   of the watershed to changes in agricultural practices was relatively
   short (6-7 years) and (iii) the expansion of an agro-environmental
   incentive based on low-input practices and grass-based fodder proposed
   by local stakeholders to the whole watershed would result in a
   significant decrease in N fluxes but would not fulfill water-quality
   objectives. This integrated assessment approach demonstrated its ability
   to promote the emergence of mitigation solutions and to improve decision
   support. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Using the Driving Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR)
   framework, this paper proposes indicators to measure human activities
   affecting three surf breaks located within Bahia de Todos Santos World
   Surfing Reserve (BTSWSR) in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. To
   develop these indicators, a learning community was formed where
   interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teams gathered information
   through document analysis, participatory methods (transect walks, focus
   groups, problem tree, participatory mapping) and participant
   observations of the actions undertaken by the BTSWSR Local Stewardship
   Council, between 2015 and 2018. Together, academics, surfers and
   decision makers defined the parameters and criteria for the assessment
   of surf breaks, developing a set of indicators that drew on both
   qualitative and quantitative data. These indicators enabled the
   identification of specific anthropogenic activities affecting surf
   breaks, their impact on the environment, and actual or possible
   responses to human activities. DPSIR indicators enabled comparison of
   states and trends in different surf sites, allowed BTSWSR co-managers to
   focus on critical issues in need of attention at each surf break, and
   facilitated the development of specific strategies for an Adaptive
   Co-management plan at BTSWSR. This model could be adapted to other surf
   breaks around the world, providing new strategies for conservation and
   management of surf zones and contributing to global marine conservation
   efforts.},

Abstract = {In 2009 Trinidad and Tobago (T\&T) ranked 57th in the world as a
   contributor to carbon emissions with some 50 million metric tonnes being
   emitted as compared to the world's top contributors; China who produced
   7 billion metric tonnes and the United States which produced 5.5 billion
   metric tonnes. However, the population of T\&T is relatively small;
   resulting in a CO2 emissions per capita ranking that is quite high. As
   such T\&T is ranked 2nd to only Qatar in CO2 emissions per capita in
   2009. This indicates that T\&T should be concerned about its levels of
   CO2 emissions and should look at options to control and reduce its
   volume. In T\&T, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be strategically placed in
   deep saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as a CO2
   mitigation measure. Theoretical case studies have been performed on the
   British Petroleum's (bpTT) Mahogany field, off Trinidad's east coast.
   The migration of injected CO2 was analysed using the CMG-GEM reservoir
   simulation software {[} 1]. Initial runs show that CO2 sequestration is
   technically feasible. However, uncertainty surrounds the economics of
   successfully undertaking a CO2 sequestering program. Given the time
   frame required to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of this
   mitigation measure, the traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) approach
   may not be suitable {[} 2]. The real option valuation (ROV) method is
   often presented as an alternative to the DCF approach because it is able
   to quantify the additional asset value arising for flexible asset
   management. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Severe salinity contamination in drinking water and associated human

Abstract = {Bangladesh is a deltaic country and is highly vulnerable to climate
   change and sea level rise. This study explores population migration risk
   in relation to communal crisis due to socioeconomic vulnerability,
   drinking water scarcity, and health threats caused by salinity hazards.
   For this, we conducted a household questionnaire survey as well as,
   focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field
   observations. To identify the drinking water salinity and migration
   risk, our theoretical process hypothesizes a new composite indexing
   approach. Salinity hazards and potable water crises have increased the
   spread of human diseases and treatment costs, while socioeconomic crisis
   and poverty are inseparable risks of coastal communities because of
   frequent cyclone hits. Recently, salinity hazards have added a new
   dimension to health insecurities and household financial instability.
   Results showed a high migration risk in the unions of Gabura,
   Munshigonj, Atulia, Burigoaliny, and Padmapukur (from highest risk to
   lowest), as these areas exhibit worsening situations with respect to
   drinking water scarcity, salinity hazards, and health hazards, and their
   adaptive capacities are significantly low. Furthermore, socioeconomic
   vulnerabilities to cyclone hits, salinity hazards, and severe drinking
   water scarcity may soon contribute to increased population migration in
   response to climate change, sea level rise, and the associated impacts
   of these trends. To tackle the future mass population migration problem,

Abstract = {Smallholder farmers in the Philippines, whose survival and livelihood
   largely depend on the environment, constantly face risks and bear the
   impacts of the changing climate. This paper explored how climate change
   knowledge as well as attitudes and perceptions to risk of smallholder
   farmers from upland, lowland and coastal ecosystems influence the manner
   on which they respond and cope with extreme events. Guided by the
   Adaptation Policy Framework, a questionnaire was developed and
   administered to 313 smallholder farmers to determine the kind of
   information that farmers have and how they respond to climate risks
   towards enhanced adaptive capacity. Seventy-nine percent of respondents
   lack basic knowledge on climate change. Majority (79\%) of respondents
   recognized that they are exposed to extreme weather risks and perceived
   climate as a major farming risk. However, availability and access to
   capital (not climate change) is the biggest perceived threat. Sixty-nine
   percent of respondents are risk-neutral while farmers who live in less
   risk-prone areas tend to be risk-takers. Based on correlation, attitudes
   on risk are influenced by exposure, economic factors and availability of
   resources. This paper recommends a more targeted climate change
   information dissemination and customized trainings that enhance
   capacity, improve livelihood choices and conserve the natural resources.},

Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation has been growing in importance since the
   beginning of the 21st century. Historically adaptation, not to climate
   change but to extreme events, was deeply rooted in many societies and
   their land-use structures. With industrialization, and especially the
   increase in globalization since the 1990's the importance of appropriate
   adaptation has slowly decreased, leading to increased exposure and risks
   of human settlements in areas potentially affected by climate change
   impacts (e.g. sea level rise) and / or extreme events (natural hazards).
   In order to implement climate change adaptation sustainably feasible
   solutions should be identified, i.e. viable and acceptable from
   socio-economic point of views. The identification of such feasible
   solutions goes beyond pure scientific analysis but incorporates
   stakeholders, decision-makers and local knowledge.},

Abstract = {This study aims to quantitatively find the influence of religion,
   culture and education on the perception of climate change, and its
   implications. A survey was carried out, with students of a college and a
   university in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and a
   university in Kiribati answering a questionnaire. It emerged that
   education has more influence than religion or culture on people's
   perceptions of climate change and its implications, both in the RMI and
   Kiribati. It is interesting because the two countries are not
   homogeneous in terms of history, culture and religion. Another
   surprising finding was that seemingly contradictory ideas (e.g., no
   flooding in the future as stated in the Bible, compared with the
   perceived sea level rise) exist in the minds of the majority of the
   respondents, both in RMI and Kiribati. Having conflicting ideas in one's
   mind may delay one taking action to cope with climate change and its
   implications.},

Title = {Divergent trends in the risk of spring frost damage to trees in Europe
   with recent warming},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {351-360},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Frost events during the active growth period of plants can cause
   extensive frost damage with tremendous economic losses and dramatic
   ecological consequences. A common assumption is that climate warming may
   bring along a reduction in the frequency and severity of frost damage to
   vegetation. On the other hand, it has been argued that rising
   temperature in late winter and early spring might trigger the so called
   ``false spring{''}, that is, early onset of growth that is followed by
   cold spells, resulting in increased frost damage. By combining daily
   gridded climate data and 1,489 k in situ phenological observations of 27
   tree species from 5,565 phenological observation sites in Europe, we
   show here that temporal changes in the risk of spring frost damage with
   recent warming vary largely depending on the species and geographical
   locations. Species whose phenology was especially sensitive to climate
   warming tended to have increased risk of frost damage. Geographically,
   compared with continental areas, maritime and coastal areas in Europe
   were more exposed to increasing occurrence of frost and these late
   spring frosts were getting more severe in the maritime and coastal
   areas. Our results suggest that even though temperatures will be
   elevated in the future, some phenologically responsive species and many
   populations of a given species will paradoxically experience more frost
   damage in the future warming climate. More attention should be paid to
   the increased frost damage in responsive species and populations in
   maritime areas when developing strategies to mitigate the potential
   negative impacts of climate change on ecosystems in the near future.},

   the Maldives},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {104-118},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The islands of the Maldives are very low lying with an average of about
   a metre above mean high tide. Consequently, climate change and
   associated sea-level rise, is a very real threat faced by the people of
   Maldives and it may well be one of the most vulnerable in the whole
   world. For the Maldives, where the whole population practically lives on
   reefs, it would not be erred in stating that their livelihoods are
   totally dependent on the reefs and the services obtained from them. In
   addition to their directly obvious economic significance, the coral
   reefs are also responsible for the protection of the coasts from the
   open sea and storms and even from obliviation of these low lying
   islands.
   While effects such as coral bleaching are consequences of natural
   events, anthropogenic causes such as coral mining, siltation and
   pollution have contributed to loss of the Maldives' reefs. The
   institutions in place to manage, sustain and conserve the reef
   environment have implemented mitigation measures towards ensuring a
   healthy and sustainable reef environment. With a few Acts of Parliament,
   most legal authority is derived from regulations pursuant to these Acts.
   Though stakeholder involvement is limited, the industrial sector has
   taken initiatives to promote reef growth. Existing measures are
   producing desired outcomes. However lessons need to be learnt from other
   similar countries and more need to be done especially in way of
   provisions for safe garbage disposal, mitigation of marine oil pollution
   and improving human resources for better management and strengthen
   resilience. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In Paris in 2015, the global community agreed to limit global warming to
   well below 2 degrees C, aiming at even 1.5 degrees C. It is still
   uncertain whether these targets are sufficient to preserve marine
   ecosystems and prevent a severe alteration of marine biogeochemical
   cycles. Here, we show that stringent mitigation strategies consistent
   with the 1.5 degrees C scenario could, indeed, provoke a critical
   difference for the ocean's carbon cycle and calcium carbonate saturation
   states. Favorable conditions for calcifying organisms like tropical
   corals and polar pteropods, both of major importance for large
   ecosystems, can only be maintained if CO2 emissions fall rapidly between
   2025 and 2050, potentially requiring an early deployment of CO2 removal
   techniques in addition to drastic emissions reduction. Furthermore, this
   outcome can only be achieved if the terrestrial biosphere remains a
   carbon sink during the entire 21st century.},

Abstract = {Global concern has sought to connect resilience with the field of
   disaster risk reduction, which was prominent in the Hyogo Framework for

   Reduction (2015-2030). However, defining disaster risk reduction and
   resilience as policy goals geared towards reducing vulnerability and
   minimizing risk requires a closer examination. This research examines
   operationalization of resilience in programs and budgets of development
   plans in Indonesian cities. This paper investigates the documentation of
   planning policies in the Indonesian context, examining National to local
   level efforts. The research specifically analyzes case studies at two
   cities, Semarang and Tegal, and highlights how these sites have
   accommodated the term resilience to address flooding. The scope of the
   research focuses on flooding as it is the most commonly experienced
   hazard across Indonesia. Content analysis is applied to assess
   identified planning documents. The content analysis is further verified
   through focus group discussions among key stakeholders. Findings
   indicate that there are fourteen areas of plans/programs in terms of
   reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and
   property, improved management of land and the environment, and improved
   preparedness to address flooding in the two selected cities. The
   elaboration of resilience-related programmes provides important lessons,
   namely that operationalizing resilience should be integrative and
   comprehensive, and require both short-term actionable initiative(s) and
   long-term transformative frameworks.},

   affected by pumping for agricultural irrigation and tidal fluctuations.
   Decreases in water levels accompanied increases in electrical
   conductivities. Vertical profile of electrical conductivity indicated
   progressive seawater encroachment. A detailed investigation and
   mitigation measure should be undertaken for the areas where electrical
   conductivities are continuously increasing.},

   shifts in oceanic biodiversity under climate change},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {175},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Oceanic top predators, the marine ecosystems that support them and
   dependent socio-economic systems have been the subject of studies by
   researchers under the Climate Impacts on Oceanic Top Predators (CLIOTOP)
   regional programme since 2005. Research conducted under the programme
   has focused on how climate change is affecting the pelagic ocean, with a
   range of impacts detected or predicted for open ocean biology, and
   provision of ecosystem services such as food. Research has also focused
   on exploring the socio-economic consequences of oceanic change, and in
   some cases, evaluating the adaptation options that can reduce the
   vulnerability to climate change. In this special issue, 18 papers
   arising from the 4th CLIOTOP symposium, held in Keelung, Taiwan Republic
   of China in October 2018, report on a wide range of predator responses
   to historical climate variability, and changes in marine systems
   associated with climate change and commercial fishing. They describe new
   frameworks and approaches for understanding the population and spatial
   dynamics, trophodynamics, and future distributions of a range of species
   as well as identifying individual drivers of change and future risks to
   populations. Several contributions further our understanding of the
   trophic linkages between prey and predators and the pathways through
   which the environment can influence predators. Research conducted
   through collaborations facilitated by CLIOTOP align with several of the
   goals set out under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and a
   number of the challenges identified as needing to be addressed in order
   to achieve the societal outcomes of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for
   Sustainable Development 2021-2030. Setting future research directions
   that maximise the potential of the network of scientists contributing to
   the CLIOTOP programme will assist in progressing the science required
   for achieving a sustainable future.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {512},
Pages = {141-154},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Currently, a central demand of coastal and marine food web researchers
   is the search for holistic and functional ecosystem health indicators.
   Based on concepts directly derived from R. L. Lindeman's work (Lindeman
   1942; Ecology 23: 399-418), 6 estuarine food web models were analysed to
   assess the potential impact of multiple disturbances on the trophic
   state of food webs. The models described a Zostera noltii meadow and a
   bare sediment site in the Mondego estuary, Portugal, during 3 distinct
   time periods corresponding to (1) nutrient enrichment, (2) the
   implementation of mitigation measures, and (3) after a centenary flood.
   We tested 4 candidate metrics, directly derived from the trophic-dynamic
   concepts proposed by Lindeman (1942): food chain length, the
   detritivory/herbivory ratio, trophic efficiency per trophic level and
   mean trophic efficiency. Based on this case study, none of the metrics
   are yet ready to be used per se as operational metrics to quantify and
   interpret the impact of disturbances on the ecosystem's trophic state.
   Trophic efficiency appeared to be sensitive to external pressures.
   However, the mean trophic efficiency of the system might not be
   sufficient to draw conclusions about the trophic efficiency of the
   ecosystem: trophic efficiency should be observed at the trophic level in
   order to better understand cascading effects within food webs.},

Abstract = {Pacific Islanders often respond emotionally and with recourse to their
   religious beliefs when faced with news about the projected consequences
   of climate change. In view of these responses, this paper argues that
   Pacific Islanders frequently combine their emotions with their
   religiosity in their efforts to shape their future. A case study of the
   atoll state of Kiribati illustrates this point. Given that most of this
   Pacific state's islands are low-lying atolls or reef islands, it is
   widely considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change
   effects. In this context, many citizens of Kiribati have recourse to
   their Christian beliefs to deal with feelings of uncertainty and imagine
   a future for their descendants. On the one hand, their religiosity helps
   them to cope with the worry over their land, fear of a rising sea level
   and sadness at the thought of a worst-case scenario and develop social
   resilience. On the other hand, they rely on their beliefs to confirm
   their love of their land and draw hope and gain strength from it in
   order to take adaptive measures.},

Title = {Assessment of the dynamics of the Volta river estuary shorelines in
   Ghana},
Journal = {GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Estuarine shorelines similar to marine coastlines are highly dynamic and
   may increase disaster risk in vulnerable communities. The situation is
   expected to worsen with climate change impacts and increasing
   anthropogenic activities such as upstream water management. This study
   assessed shoreline changing trends along the Volta river estuary in
   Ghana as well as the marine coastline using satellite imageries,
   orthophotos and topographic maps spanning a period of 120years (1895,
   1990, 2000, 2005 and 2015). Linear regression method in the Digital
   Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to determine the estuary
   shoreline migration trend by estimating the shorelines rate of change
   for the eastern and western sides of the estuary. The rates of change of
   the marine coastlines on the east and west of the estuary were also
   estimated. The results show that the eastern and western shoreline of
   the estuary are eroding at an average rate of about 1.94m/yr and
   0.58m/yr respectively. The coastlines on the marine side (eastern and
   western) are eroding at an average rate of about 2.19m/yr and 0.62m/yr
   respectively. Relatively high rates of erosion observed on the eastern
   estuarine shoreline as well as the coastline could be explained by the
   reduced sediment supply by the Volta River due to the damming of the
   Volta River in Akosombo and the sea defence structures constructed to
   manage erosion problems. The trend is expected to increase under
   changing oceanographic conditions and increased subsidence in the Volta
   delta. Effective management approach, such as developing disaster risk
   reduction strategy, should be adopted to increase the resilience of the
   communities along the estuarine shoreline and increase their adaptive
   capacity to climate change hazards and disasters.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {405-418},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Regional analyses of atmospheric conditions that may cause flooding of
   important transport infrastructure (railway tracks, highways/roads,
   rivers/channels) and subsequent adaptation measures are part of topic 1
   of the network of experts initiated by the German Federal Ministry of
   Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI). As an example case study,
   the December 2014 flood in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, was
   investigated. Atmospheric conditions at the onset of the flood event are
   described and evaluated with respect to the general weather circulation,
   initial wetness, and event precipitation. Persistent, predominantly
   westerly general weather circulations (GWCs) directed several
   low-pressure systems over the North Sea to Schleswig-Holstein during
   December 2014, accompanied by prolonged rainfall and finally a strong
   precipitation event in southern Schleswig-Holstein, causing several
   inland gauges to exceed their, by then maximum, water levels. Results
   show that the antecedent precipitation index (API) is able to reflect
   the soil moisture conditions and, in combination with the maximum 3-day
   precipitation sum (R3d), to capture the two main drivers finally leading
   to the flood: (1) the initial wetness of north-western
   Schleswig-Holstein and (2) strong event precipitation in southern and
   eastern Schleswig-Holstein from 21 to 23 December; at the same time,
   both indices exceeded their respective 5-year return periods. Further,
   trend analyses show that both API and R3d have been increasing during
   recent years, while regional patterns match the north-eastward shift of
   cyclone pathways, leading to a higher risk of flooding in
   Schleswig-Holstein. Within the network of experts, investigations of
   these and further indices/drivers for earth system changes (e.g. wind
   surge and sea level rise) derived from observations, reanalyses, and
   regional climate model data are planned for all German coastal areas.
   Results can be expected to lead to improved adaptation measures to
   floods under climate change conditions wherever catchments have to be
   drained and infrastructures and ecosystems may be harmed.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates why households migrated as a unit to Khulna City
   from the affected Upazilas of Dacope and Koyra in Khulna District,
   Bangladesh, following Cyclone Aila on 25 May 2009. The study reveals
   that households migrated primarily because of the livelihood stress that
   resulted from the failure to derive a secure income like before the
   event from the impacted areasother push and pull factors also played a
   part in their migration decision. Despite all of the Aila-induced losses
   and problems, all households wanted to avoid migration, but they were
   unable to do so for this principal reason. The findings also demonstrate
   that, if livelihoods cannot be restored, some form of widespread
   migration is inevitable after a disaster such as this one. In addition,
   they show that migration has the potential to serve as a key adaptive
   response to environmental events, as evidenced by the improved economic
   conditions of a substantial number of the migrated households.},

Abstract = {On account of the growth and expansions in the oil and gas sectors,
   TRINMAR, the marine arm of PETROTRIN, the state-owned oil and gas
   company of Trinidad and Tobago is required to move its port facilities
   from its current location at Point Fortin to a location 7 km south,
   namely Mont Pellier estate on Irois Bay in the Gulf of Paria. This paper
   addresses the vulnerability of the Mont Pellier site to rising sea
   levels, as caused by climate change. Sea level scenarios are created
   fi-om the outputs of two coupled atmosphere-ocean geneneral ciculation
   models (A-OGCM's), namely the Canadian (CGCMI) and British (HadCM3)
   models. Photogrammtric and field surveys are used to create a Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area. Future scenarios of sea level
   rise over the short (2031), medium (2051) and long (2071) terms, coupled
   with estimations of accelerated erosion rates based on the Bruun
   principle, are then used to assess the vulnerability of the port and
   built infrastructure to future sea levels. In light of these
   vulnerability assessments, adaptation measures are proposed to minimise
   the impacts of future sea levels on the Mont Pellier port and harbour
   facilities.},

Abstract = {Although the safety record of maritime industry has been constantly
   improving during the past decades accidents that challenge public outcry
   and hurt the image of shipping industry still happen. In response to
   this situation a substantial amount of effort has been devoted in
   de-risking ships during the design process. However, the highly
   competitive nature of the industry and the constant exposure of ships to
   the marine environment enforce the need for managing the residual risk
   of ships during their operational life. This requirement paves the way
   for the development of a comprehensive methodology that will take into
   account all the stages of an accident between its route causes and the
   aftermath of it. In this manner, efficient and cost-effective strategies
   pertaining to prevention and mitigation measures can be established. The
   objective of this paper is to outline a methodology for structural
   damage assessment with particular emphasis to collision and grounding
   accidents, and to elaborate on the constitutive elements of it by (i)
   utilising existing work in the respective areas, and (ii) highlighting
   the weaknesses that prohibit comprehensive treatment of the underlying
   phenomena.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an overview and assessment of the measures
   implemented in Cyprus that are considered in order to address the
   impacts of climate change on the water availability of the country.
   Considering that an adaptation framework on water resources has not yet
   been established either at European level or in Cyprus, specific
   measures that address climate change impacts on water availability,
   constituted the basis of the analysis. The measures reviewed are in the
   form of infrastructural works, policy plans and strategies, legislative
   actions, market-based instruments (e.g. pricing mechanisms and
   subsidies), technologies and practices, research, as well as awareness
   and dissemination activities. The measures are assessed based on their
   effectiveness, their robustness under climate change uncertainty and
   their sustainability in environmental, economic and social terms. In
   addition, potential barriers and risks associated to the implementation
   of the adaptation are identified. The results of the study revealed that
   although there is a substantial number of adaptation measures in place
   that are considered to address climate change impacts on water resources
   and the adaptive capacity of the water sector has considerably
   increased, the overall vulnerability remains high, as water demand is
   still not satisfied at certain areas and/or for certain uses, in times
   of drought. Furthermore, there should be a shift towards a more balanced
   and integrated approach on water management in Cyprus, according to
   which demand-side measures are further enhanced, while adverse impacts
   associated with the implementation of the measures are minimized to the
   degree possible. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Large cities account for a significant share of national population and
   wealth, and exert high pressure on local and regional resources,
   exacerbating socioenvironmental risks. The replacement of natural
   landscapes with higher heat capacity materials because of urbanization
   and anthropogenic waste heat are some of the factors contributing to
   local climate change caused by the urban heat island (UHI) effect.
   Because of synergistic effects, local climate change can exacerbate the
   impacts of global warming in cities. Disentangling the contributions to
   warming in cities from global and local drivers can help to understand
   their relative importance and guide local adaptation policies. The
   canopy UHI intensity is commonly approximated by the difference between
   temperatures within cities and the surrounding areas. We present a
   complementary approach that applies the concept of common trends to
   extract the global contributions to observed warming in cities and to
   obtain a residual warming trend caused by local and regional factors.
   Once the effects of global drivers are removed, common features appear
   in cities' temperatures in the eastern part of the United States. Most
   cities experienced higher warming than that attributable to global
   climate change, and some shared a period of rapid warming during urban
   sprawl in the mid-20th century in the United States.},

Abstract = {As the climate changes with the population expansion in Pakistan,
   wildfires are becoming more threatening. The goal of this study was to
   understand fire trends which might help to improve wildland management
   and reduction in wildfire risk in Pakistan. Using descriptive analyses,
   we investigated the spatiotemporal trends and causes of wildfire in the
   2001-2020 period. Optimized machine learning (ML) models were
   incorporated using variables representing potential fire drivers, such
   as weather, topography, and fuel, which includes vegetation, soil, and
   socioeconomic data. The majority of fires occurred in the last 5 years,
   with winter being the most prevalent season in coastal regions. ML
   models such as RF outperformed others and correctly predicted fire
   occurrence (AUC values of 0.84-0.93). Elevation, population, specific
   humidity, vapor pressure, and NDVI were all key factors; however, their
   contributions varied depending on locational clusters and seasons. The
   percentage shares of climatic conditions, fuel, and topographical
   variables at the country level were 55.2\%, 31.8\%, and 12.8\%,
   respectively. This study identified the probable driving factors of
   Pakistan wildfires, as well as the probability of fire occurrences
   across the country. The analytical approach, as well as the findings and
   conclusions reached, can be very useful to policymakers,
   environmentalists, and climate change researchers, among others, and may
   help Pakistan improve its wildfire management and mitigation.},

Abstract = {The study assesses household livelihood vulnerability and adaptive
   capacity in a flood prone area of the eastern Indian state of West
   Bengal. The analysis is based on the primary data collected from two
   administrative blocks of Murshidabad district of the state where
   frequent occurrences of floods cause damages to both human lives and
   property. In order to develop a comprehensive livelihood framework to
   measure the degree of livelihood vulnerability of the flood affected
   households, the study uses both vulnerability framework proposed by the
   IPCC and Sustainable Livelihood Framework developed by the DFID. A
   composite Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVIs) is estimated by
   combining the household level data, and a comparative analysis is
   carried out between two administrative blocks and overall district level
   scenario. The results suggest that Jiaganj block is more vulnerable than
   Berhampore block; the overall adaptive capacity of the households was
   less than the exposure and sensitivity to flood events. Vulnerability
   elements such as exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity are found
   to be significantly influenced by age of the household head, household
   income, land holding size and family size. Some of the key household
   coping and adaptation strategies to floods identified in the study area
   include borrowing money from friends/relatives, money lender, selling
   assets and livestock, diversification of livelihoods, migration,
   elevation of the height of houses, preserving food and fuel stocks.},

Title = {The climatic debt of loggerhead sea turtle populations in a warming
   world},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Phenological shifts, by initiating reproductive events earlier, in
   response to advanced seasonal warming is one of the most striking
   effects currently observed in wild populations. For sea turtles,
   phenological adjustment to warming conditions could be the most
   effective short-term adaptation option against climate change. We
   calculated future phenological changes required in seven important
   loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nesting populations to continue achieving a
   high hatching success and a sex ratio that lies within current ranges.
   Considering temperature-mediated phenological changes, we found that
   most populations (six out of seven) will not be able to keep pace with a
   warming climate. Under an optimistic climate warming scenario (RCP4.5),
   these populations will face a climatic debt, that is, a difference
   between required and expected phenological changes, and warming will
   substantially reduce hatching success and induce a feminization of
   hatchlings, which may jeopardize their reproductive sustainability. Our
   approach offers the possibility to quantify the efficiency of
   phenological shifts in oviparous reptiles by considering physiological,
   developmental and phenological processes.},

Abstract = {Ecological thresholds, associated with abrupt changes in the state and
   organisation of ecosystems, challenge both scientists and managers.
   Adaptive response to such changes, and planning for their occurrence,
   requires an understanding of the underlying drivers and system responses
   as well as appropriate monitoring. In addition to field studies,
   modelling can advance our ability to anticipate or deal with such major
   ecosystem shifts. Here, we used an existing multi species model with
   smooth continuous functions that were modified to include thresholds
   representing 3 alternative scenarios of predator responses when prey
   numbers drop below a critical threshold: (I) no threshold-like response;
   (II) an abrupt decrease in breeding success by 90\%, and (III) an abrupt
   halving of adult survival. Second, we analysed field observations from 3
   independent marine case studies (abalone, starfish, penguins) for
   evidence of abrupt non-linear responses of predators to changes in
   abundance of principal prey. Third, we compared the model output with
   empirical results and tested (using both a statistical method and by
   fitting multispecies models) the 3 alternative response scenarios. With
   this approach, we found evidence for nonlinear changes in population
   parameters (such as survival rate) of predators as prey numbers declined
   below critical thresholds. As an example of the potential for this
   approach to inform management, we found that abundances of a range of
   marine predators become more variable as prey numbers decline, which may
   be a useful indicator that a system is approaching a tipping point.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The negative impact of climate change, especially in urban areas,
   requires the use of new construction technologies and materials,
   harmonized with environmental aspects. One such approach is the
   construction of green areas on flat roofs of buildings. The positive
   impact of greening roofs is reflected in several important aspects:
   environmental, economic, and social. The pilot area that was researched
   is characterized by a high coefficient of construction. All this affects
   the creation of the so-called heat island and bad microclimatic
   conditions, as well as the lack of areas that can be arranged for the
   rest of the local population. In addition to the impact of this type of
   urban planning on the preservation of the city's environment, the costs
   of building green roofs are also presented. In the final part of the
   article, the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of green roof layers is
   presented, using the Eco-indicator method to show the environmental
   impact of a materials based on data from a life cycle assessment.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {175-185},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {As climate change continues to impact New England's coastal ecosystems
   and their related fisheries, the need for measuring, projecting,
   interpreting, and applying those impacts for adaptive management is
   expanding. In New England, different types of formal and informal
   research efforts that involve collaboration between the fishing
   community and traditional university and government researchers continue
   to develop to address some of this need. To better understand the
   opportunities and challenges that these collaborative research efforts
   face, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 members of the
   fishing and research communities who are engaged in advancing New
   England climate change and fisheries science. Participants showed clear
   concern for the impacts of climate change on New England fisheries and
   about the insufficient availability of the necessary science to manage
   for those impacts. They also noted a number of challenges in
   collaborative research, including poor communication and a lack of trust
   among fishers, researchers, and decision makers, as well as a lack of
   perceived credibility for research coming out of the fishing community.
   We identify a number of opportunities for improving collaboration and
   communication among these groups, which could build upon the identified
   value of existing collaborations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The provinces of Russia and Ukraine located within the Azov sea basin
   are important producers of grains, sugar, sunflower, meat, and milk.
   Nineteen Russian provinces of the region together harvest almost half of
   all grain in Russia; agriculture contributes 28\% to their total GDP. In
   Ukraine, four provinces collect 15\% of grain harvested in the country.
   Because of heavy dependence of regional economics on agriculture, and
   major effects of regional agriculture on food security of the entire
   countries, climate change impacts on food production and water resources
   constitute major threats to the food security of both Russia and
   Ukraine. Historically, major droughts frequently affected the
   agriculture of the region, with resulting crop failures affecting the
   entire population of Russian Empire and USSR. The recent climate change
   seems beneficial for agriculture of the region: warmer temperatures
   extend growing season and elevate the accumulated heat. At the same
   time, further warming is not likely to be matched by higher
   precipitation, with negative impacts from the increasing aridity of
   climate. The most effective adaptation option, expansion of irrigation,
   is limited with high pressure on water resources, which is already high
   in many parts of the region.},

Abstract = {Both climate change and biological invasions are among the most serious
   global environmental threats. Yet mechanisms underlying these eventual
   interactions remain unclear. The aim of this study was to undertake a
   comprehensive examination of the physiological and biochemical responses
   of native (Ruditapes decussatus) and alien-invasive (Ruditapes
   philippinarum) clams to environmental warming. We evaluated thermal
   tolerance limits (CTMax), routine metabolic rates (RMRs) and respective
   thermal sensitivity (Q(10) values), critical oxygen partial pressure
   (Bait), heat shock response (HSP70/HSC70 levels), lipid peroxidation
   (MDA build-up) and antioxidant enzyme {[}glutathione-S-transferase
   (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)] activities.
   Contrary to most studies that show that invasive species have a higher
   thermal tolerance than native congeners, here we revealed that the
   alien-invasive and native species had similar CTMax values. However,
   warming had a stronger effect on metabolism and oxidative status of the
   native R. decussatus, as indicated by the higher RMRs and HSP70/HSC70
   and MDA levels, as well as GST, CAT and SOD activities. Moreover, we
   argue that the alien-invasive clams, instead of up-regulating
   energetically expensive cellular responses, have evolved a less
   demanding strategy to cope with short-term environmental (oxidative)
   stress-pervasive valve closure. Although efficient during stressful
   short-term periods to ensure isolation and guarantee longer survival,
   such adaptive behavioural strategy entails metabolic arrest (and the
   enhancement of anaerobic pathways), which to some extent will not be
   advantageous under the chronically warming conditions predicted in the
   future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate change adaptations of shrimp farmers: a case study from

Abstract = {Sustainability of brackishwater shrimp farming is of paramount
   importance for socio-economic development of southwest coastal
   Bangladesh. Here, shrimp farming is predominantly traditional, which is
   more vulnerable to climate change. Lack of understanding exists
   regarding the adaptation measures of local shrimp farmers in response to
   emerging impacts of changing climatic variables. This study provides the
   perceptions and adaptations of shrimp farmers in changing climatic
   context. A systematic random sampling method was employed to conduct a
   total of 240 questionnaire surveys and 60 key informant interviews from
   six sub-districts (Upazila) of southwest coastal Bangladesh to collect
   primary data. Changes in climate variables largely affect the shrimp
   yield by increasing frequency of shrimp disease, causing physical damage
   to farm structure and deteriorating quality of water. Shrimp farmers try
   to adapt to those changes in various ways, including increasing pond
   depth, exchanging tidal water, providing shade using aquatic plants,
   strengthening earthen dike and netting and fencing around the dike.
   Shrimp mixed cultivation is the most popular form of shrimp farming in
   the study area. More emphasis on implementing polyculture shrimp farming
   is necessary to improve climate change adaptation and to promote
   sustainability of this aquaculture practice in southwest coastal
   Bangladesh.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Lagoons are highly productive coastal features that provide a range of
   natural services that society values. Their setting within the coastal
   landscape leaves them especially vulnerable to profound physical,
   ecological, and associated societal disturbance from global climate
   change. Expected shifts in physical and ecological characteristics range
   from changes in flushing regime, freshwater inputs, and water chemistry
   to complete inundation and loss and the concomitant loss of natural and
   human communities. Therefore, managing coastal lagoons in the context of
   global climate change is critical. Although management approaches will
   vary depending on local conditions and cultural norms, all management
   scenarios will need to be nimble and to make full use of the spectrum of
   values through which society views these unique ecosystems. We propose
   that this spectrum includes pragmatic, scholarly, aesthetic, and tacit
   categories of value. Pragmatic values such as fishery or tourism revenue
   are most easily quantified and are therefore more likely to be
   considered in management strategies. In contrast, tacit values such as a
   sense of place are more difficult to quantify and therefore more likely
   to be left out of explicit management justifications. However, tacit
   values are the most influential to stakeholder involvement because they
   both derive from and shape individual experiences and beliefs. Tacit
   values underpin all categories of social values that we describe and can
   be expected to have a strong influence over human behavior. The
   articulation and inclusion of the full spectrum of values, especially
   tacit values, will facilitate and support nimble adaptive management of
   coastal lagoon ecosystems in the context of global climate change.},

Title = {Cyclone risk assessment of the Cox's Bazar district and Rohingya refugee
   camps in southeast Bangladesh},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {704},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Bangladesh has a long history of devastating tropical cyclones. In view
   of the effects of the storms on the country, risk assessment is
   essential for devising the mitigation strategies at various levels. By
   way of bringing the conceptual structure of general risk model in
   practice, this work aims to examine the spatial patterns of cyclone risk
   in the Cox's Bazar district (I) and Rohingya refugee camps (II) located
   on the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. We use 14 parameters
   representing the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability as the components
   of risk. The selected parameters were analyzed and integrated though the
   complementary use of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic
   Information System (GIS) for depicting the cyclone risk situation
   comprehensively at both the spatial scales. The status of the cyclone
   risk was identified and quantified as very high (6.84\%, 3.43\%), high
   (45.78\%, 27.82\%), moderate (5.97\%, 39.42\%), low (40.62\%, 28.70\%),
   and very low (0.81\%, 0.61\%) for the spatial scale I and II
   respectively. In general, northwestern and southern peripheral areas
   exhibited higher risk than the central and northeastern parts of the
   Cox's Bazar district; and in the refugee settlements, camp number 1E,
   1W, 7, and 13 revealed relatively higher levels of the risk. The results
   of the assessment (I) were correlated with experiential damage from the
   1991 cyclone; a reasonable consistency was noticed between the simulated
   scenario and the observed impacts. We assume that the deliverables of
   this spatial analysis could be useful to stakeholders while formulating
   the cyclone risk mitigation policies for the region. Furthermore, this
   work demonstrates that the applied method would deliver reliable results
   if tested in other coastal environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Caribbean islands, like other Small Island Developing States (SIDS), are
   at the center of the vulnerability debate as current climatic trends
   predict elevated sea levels and increased frequency of storms, leading
   to significant challenges for local communities. Caribbean islanders
   have been exposed to climatic challenges since the initial occupation of
   the archipelago between five to eight thousand years ago. They have been
   continually confronted with severe droughts, tropical cyclones, extreme
   wave events, sea-level changes, and the accompanying impacts. The
   various phenomena have stimulated island residents both to anticipate
   and respond to such events, adapting their lifestyles and socio-cultural
   and political structures and ties across the region over time. In this
   article, we innovatively combine archaeological and palaeoenvironmental
   data with longitudinal coastal-erosion data and ethnographic data to
   further develop and promote sustainable local strategies to mitigate the
   adverse effects of climate change and increasingly frequent and violent
   weather events on small-island settings. To find proxies, we first look
   into the region's pre-colonial archaeological record. Second, we delve
   into predictive modeling and the current and future climatic challenges
   for heritage sites and local coastal communities, as well as related
   collaborative heritage mitigation efforts. Third, we discuss the
   contribution of traditional knowledge practices to climate change
   adaptation. The results show how the long-term perspective and
   multidisciplinary approach adopted here may lead to realistic solutions
   to seemingly intractable problems. They also reveal how collaborative
   projects involving all stakeholders on an equal basis in all phases of
   research have become a top priority in climate change mitigation and
   heritage safeguarding.},

Title = {The effectiveness of cool and green roofs in mitigating urban heat
   island and improving human thermal comfort},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {217},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Urban residents suffer more from heat stress, compared to people living
   in rural areas, due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Mitigation of
   UHI is thus essential to improving human thermal comfort and living
   environment in urban residential areas. However, little attention has
   been paid to the integrated effect of UHI mitigation strategies on human
   thermal comfort, which is influenced by the combination of temperature,
   humidity, wind, and radiation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of
   two promising UHI mitigation strategies, cool and green roofs, in
   improving human thermal comfort during a heatwave in Berlin. Human
   thermal comfort is represented by the Universal Thermal Climate Index
   (UTCI), calculated by combining the Weather Research and Forecasting
   model coupled with the Urban Canopy Model (WRF/UCM) with the RayMan
   model. The results show that cool roofs outperform green roofs in
   reducing urban temperatures, especially at night. Besides temperature
   reduction, both strategies show lower wind speed, lower mean radiant
   temperature, and higher relative humidity. These combined effects lead
   to a city-scale decrease in UTCI. Cool roofs reduce more UTCI than green
   roofs, although they both shorten the duration of strong heat stress
   from 7 h d-1 to 5 h d-1. A higher albedo and irrigation can strengthen
   the cooling effect of cool and green roofs, respectively. Our study can
   deepen the understanding of the mechanism of natural infrastructure in
   improving human thermal comfort, providing scientific guidance for
   future city management.},

Abstract = {Loss of Arctic sea ice owing to climate change is predicted to reduce
   both genetic diversity and gene flow in ice-dependent species, with
   potentially negative consequences for their long-term viability. Here,
   we tested for the population-genetic impacts of reduced sea ice cover on
   the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) sampled across two decades (1995-2016)
   from the Svalbard Archipelago, Norway, an area that is affected by rapid
   sea ice loss in the Arctic Barents Sea. We analysed genetic variation at
   22 microsatellite loci for 626 polar bears from four sampling areas
   within the archipelago. Our results revealed a 3-10\% loss of genetic
   diversity across the study period, accompanied by a near 200\% increase
   in genetic differentiation across regions. These effects may best be
   explained by a decrease in gene flow caused by habitat fragmentation
   owing to the loss of sea ice coverage, resulting in increased inbreeding
   of local polar bears within the focal sampling areas in the Svalbard
   Archipelago. This study illustrates the importance of genetic monitoring
   for developing adaptive management strategies for polar bears and other
   ice-dependent species.},

Abstract = {In the context of the impact of urbanization on climate change, this
   work aims to evaluate the sensitivity of the thermal and radiative
   properties of building surfaces in urban areas to the urban heat island
   intensity, a local scale meteorological phenomenon. For this, variations
   of albedo values, emissivity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity of
   roofs, streets and walls were simulated through an urban scheme coupled
   with the BRAMS mesoscale atmospheric model for the metropolitan area of
   Sao Paulo, considering two main urban types. The simulations show that,
   in general, looking for cold surface situations, the change of building
   material can contribute to a reduction of up to 3 degrees C for Sao
   Paulo. In addition, the role of orientation and the typological
   characteristics of constructions should be taken into account. In this
   sense, it is expected that this work guides civil engineers and builders
   to search for new materials in order to reduce the effects of
   urbanization on the local climate.},

Title = {Adaptation time to magnified flood hazards underestimated when derived
   from tide gauge records},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise magnifies flood hazards, raising the question when
   adaptation measures need to be taken. Here, we quantify when the
   recurrence of extreme water level events will double due to projected
   sea-level rise. Reproducing the most common method based on extreme
   water levels observed with tide gauges, at least one third of the
   coastal locations are to expect a doubling of extremes within a decade.
   However, tide gauges are commonly placed in wave-sheltered harbours
   where the contribution of waves to water levels is much smaller than at
   nearby wave-exposed coastlines such as beaches and dikes. In this study,
   we quantify doubling times at a variety of idealised shorelines based on
   modelled tides, storm surges and waves. We apply an extreme value
   analysis that accounts for the joint probability of extreme storm surges
   and extreme waves. Our results indicate that doubling times at
   wave-exposed shorelines are longer than those in wave-sheltered
   harbours, allowing for more time to adapt to magnified flood hazards.
   The median doubling times of average water levels including
   parameterised wave set-up are 1.2 to 5 times longer than those of still
   water levels as observed with tide gauges. For instantaneous water
   levels including wave run-up, doubling times are an additional 30\% to
   100\% longer. We conclude that tide gauge-based analyses underestimate
   adaptation times by underestimating the contribution of waves to extreme
   water levels, and provide a quantitative framework to guide adaptation
   policy at wave-exposed shorelines.},

Journal = {NOISE MAPPING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {26-36},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ports are characterized by several complex operations. Accordingly, the
   analysis of noise results is complicated due to the presence in the same
   area of diverse sound from ships, trade and also from industrial and
   shipyards activities as well as auxiliary services producing negative
   effects on natural ecosystem and the urban population. The ENPI CBC MED
   project Managing the Environmental Sustainability of Ports for a durable
   development (MESP) addressed the pollution reduction from port
   activities through the implementation of a multidisciplinary approach in
   air, noise and water sectors, encompassing technological, regulatory and
   administrative solutions to ensure natural and urban sustainability and
   high level of life quality in surrounding territories. To prevent a
   heterogeneous development, the ``status quo{''} of ports in Northern and
   Southern Shores of the Mediterranean Sea was analyzed and a guideline on
   methodologies, good practices and measurement assessment, adaptable and
   transferable in different port contexts was elaborated. To assess the
   procedures, validation tests have been carried out to different real
   cases. In noise sector pilot projects in the ports of Patras, Greece,
   and Tripoli, Lebanon, have been implemented. Due to the dissimilar
   scenarios, in terms of orography, facilities and activities, different
   noise mitigation actions and interventions were consequently
   accomplished.},

Title = {Assessment of Australian Sea Lion Bycatch Mortality in a Gillnet
   Fishery, and Implementation and Evaluation of an Effective Mitigation
   Strategy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Globally, the bycatch of marine mammals in fisheries represents the
   greatest source of human-caused mortality that threatens the
   sustainability of many populations and species. The Australian sea lion
   (Neophoca cinerea) is an endangered species, whose populations off South
   Australia (SA) have been subject to bycatch in a demersal gillnet
   fishery targeting sharks since the 1960s. A comprehensive assessment was
   undertaken of sea lion bycatch mortality that combined independent
   fishery observer data with species distribution models (underpinned by
   satellite tracking, abundance data and population modeling) to model the
   relationship between at-sea foraging effort and bycatch rate. Combined
   with the distribution of fishing effort, these models enabled the
   overall level of bycatch mortality to be estimated by age, sex and
   subpopulation, facilitating population viability analyses that indicated
   most subpopulations were declining, and subject to unsustainable levels
   of bycatch mortality. To reduce this mortality, the Australian Fisheries
   Management Authority implemented an Australian Sea Lion Management
   Strategy that included an independent observer program (ultimately 100\%
   electronic monitoring of gillnet fishing off SA), permanent spatial
   gillnet closures around all sea lion breeding sites, bycatch mortality
   limits that triggered temporal (18 months) spatial closures when
   zone-specific bycatch trigger limits were reached, and incentives for
   gillnet fishers to switch to an alternate fishing method (longlines).
   The Strategy had immediate impacts on the fishery: it resulted in
   significant reductions in gillnet fishing effort and on the reported
   bycatch of sea lions. In the next decade, there was an estimated 98\%
   reduction in sea lion bycatch mortality from gillnet interactions and an
   apparent stabilization of the decline in sea lion pup abundances at some
   impacted breeding sites. There was an almost complete transition in the
   fishery from gillnets to longlines, and fishing catches returned to
   pre-management levels. The successful implementation of management
   measures to mitigate sea lion bycatch mortality in the gillnet fishery
   off SA was rapid, science informed, adaptive, comprehensive, and backed
   by strong compliance and monitoring of the fishery. It provides an
   important case study which demonstrates how management measures can be
   effectively applied to mitigate bycatch mortality of marine mammals and
   other marine protected species.},

Abstract = {In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, with more frequent extreme weather
   events and rising sea level in progress, addressing the vulnerability of
   US coastal cities and towns has become a matter of urgency. But out of
   disasters can come opportunities for innovation. Post-Sandy, a range of
   new initiatives, tools, policies, governance frameworks and incentives
   are being tested, including competition processes like Rebuild by
   Design. Design is seen as a key tool for dealing with complex problems
   by creating integrated strategies to build resilience, sustainability
   and livability. Using the Rebuild by Design process as a case study,
   this article considers the potential of such a process to drive
   innovation and deliver resiliency projects and strategies that can be
   implemented and leveraged to have a catalytic impact on a broader scale.

   small-scale coastal fishers in Bangladesh and which immediate measures
   are required to develop and implement insights, on the role of the scale
   of governance attributes, in facilitating or impeding the resilience of
   small-scale fisheries (SSFs). We analyzed both qualitative and
   quantitative data obtained through semi-structured, in-depth individual
   interviews (n = 120). Data were further validated using two focus group
   discussions in the study areas. The impact of the pandemic on the
   fishers' livelihood included halting all kinds of fishing activities;
   limited time or area for fishing; livelihood relocation or alternative
   work; low fish price; fewer fish buyers, causing difficulty in selling;
   and travel or free-movement restrictions. Additionally, the study
   discovered several coping skills and found that the most prevalent
   coping strategy against the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic was to take
   out loans (48\%) from different organizations and NGOs and borrow money
   from relatives, neighbors, friends, or boat owners. Finally, the current
   research analysis identified possible recommendations to enhance the
   resilience of coastal fishers during COVID-19, emphasizing arrangements
   that should be made to provide alternative livelihood opportunities for
   coastal fishermen via need-based training, technical and vocational
   education and training, and microcredit to keep them afloat and earning
   during the pandemic, not relying only on fishing.},

Title = {Poverty eradication in a carbon constrained world},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aims to keep warming below
   2 degrees C while recognizing developing countries' right to eradicate
   extreme poverty. Poverty eradication is also the first of the
   Sustainable Development Goals. This paper investigates potential
   consequences for climate targets of achieving poverty eradication. We
   find that eradicating extreme poverty, i.e., moving people to an income
   above \$1.9 purchasing power parity (PPP) a day, does not jeopardize the
   climate target even in the absence of climate policies and with current
   technologies. On the other hand, bringing everybody to a still modest
   expenditure level of at least \$2.97 PPP would have long-term
   consequences on achieving emission targets. Compared to the reference
   mitigation pathway, eradicating extreme poverty increases the effort by
   2.8\% whereas bringing everybody to at least \$2.97 PPP would increase
   the required mitigation rate by 27\%. Given that the top 10\% global
   income earners are responsible for 36\% of the current carbon footprint
   of households; the discourse should address income distribution and the
   carbon intensity of lifestyles.},

Title = {A web-based GIS platform supporting innovative irrigation management
   techniques at farm-scale for the Mediterranean island of Crete},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {842},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is the creation of an integrated and free-access
   web platform for parcel irrigation water management on a large spatial
   scale (Water District of Crete, in Greece) in order to: a) accurately
   determine the irrigation needs of the main crops for Crete such as
   olives, citrus, avocados and vineyards, b) design strategies, for
   optimal adaptation of the agricultural sector in the context of climate
   change, and c) incorporate the dynamic integration of the above
   information through the creation of a digital platform. In the proposed
   decision-making system, essential factors are taken into account, such
   as real-time meteorological data, information about the type and spatial
   distribution of the agricultural parcels in Crete, algorithms for
   calculation crop evapotranspiration per development stage and age of the
   crops, satellite remote sensing techniques in combination with field
   surveys to depict accurate soil texture map for the whole island of
   Crete as well as sustainable cultivation practices for saving water per
   crop and parcel geomorphology. Based on the proposed decision-making
   system, users will have the opportunity in any specific location/farm in
   Crete to know the irrigation needs of the crops in real-time and obtain
   information about proper climate-water adaptation practices. The main
   novelty points of the proposed platform include the derivation of
   parcel-level soil texture data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and
   field samples, the comprehensiveness of the irrigation management
   information, the relatively low data requirements and the application
   interface simplicity provided to the end-user.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Human-induced environmental changes have been linked directly with loss
   of biodiversity. Coral reefs, which have been severely impacted by
   anthropogenic activities over the last few decades, exemplify this
   global problem and provide an opportunity to develop research addressing
   key knowledge gaps through ``omics{''}-based approaches. While many
   stressors, e.g., global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, and
   coastal development have been identified, there is an urgent need to
   understand how corals function at a basic level in order to conceive
   strategies for mitigating future reef loss. In this regard, availability
   of fully sequenced genomes has been immensely valuable in providing
   answers to questions of organismal biology. Given that corals are
   metaorganisms comprised of the coral animal host, its intracellular
   photosynthetic algae, and associated microbiota (i.e., bacteria,
   archaea, fungi, viruses), these efforts must focus on entire coral
   holobionts. The Reef Future Genomics 2020 (ReFuGe 2020) Consortium has
   formed to sequence hologenomes of 10 coral species representing
   different physiological or functional groups to provide foundation data
   for coral reef adaptation research that is freely available to the
   research community.},

Title = {An approach to ecosystem-based management in maritime spatial planning
   process},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {65-81},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Sustainable development is the framing concept assuring that resources
   are exploited while maintaining the ability of these natural resources
   to provide for future generations. With human dependence on marine
   resources increasing, Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) has been
   identified as a suitable approach to ensure sustainable development. In
   order to achieve this, the core principles and elements of EBM should be
   operational in the maritime/marine spatial planning (MSP) process to
   ensure that human activities in marine space are ordered to attain
   ecological, economic and social objectives. However, policies from
   various states and organizations sometimes do not set a clear precedence
   for translating principles of EBM and present different and complex
   approaches to an ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (EB-MSP).
   Again, a feasible methodology for EBM to be operational in MSP is still
   vague. This paper therefore presents results from a survey and review of
   MSP initiatives in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Results showed that
   essential MSP steps and elements such as adaptive management, setting of
   planning boundaries, understanding and analysing the ecosystem and
   future conditions are not fully operational. This paper focuses on a
   methodology for EB-MSP and gives recommendations on how to ensure that
   EBM is operational at each stage of an MSP process. It stresses the
   importance of setting planning boundaries beyond jurisdictional borders
   to consider bio/eco-regions and cover near-shore waters, the need to
   have a cross-sector integration, understanding the ecosystem through
   having an ecosystem service perspective and having a legal framework to
   ensure that results from monitoring and evaluating of plans are adapted
   through review and revision. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   islands},
Journal = {GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS \& RISK},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {691-702},
Abstract = {An objective method is proposed to evaluate the susceptibility of
   islands to climate change. As used here, susceptibility is an estimate
   of the potential for physical change of an island coast in response to
   likely changes in climate-ocean boundary conditions. The evaluation is
   based on an assumption that the intensity of impact due to climate and
   ocean processes can be typically related to four physical and
   quantifiable variables: island rock-type (lithology), island shape
   (circularity), maximum elevation and area. These four physical variables
   were used to determine a dimensionless index for each of 1779 islands
   across 26 countries and 8 island types in the Pacific Ocean. Most
   islands fell in the high (29\%), moderate (23\%) and low (23\%)
   susceptibility classes, whilst the remainder were split between the
   extremes of very high (12\%) and very low (13\%). Eleven countries had
   islands with all five levels, while eight had islands with mostly high
   and very high ratings.The index may be used as a tool for rapid
   appraisal by international and regional agencies as well as national
   governments for prioritization of adaptation measures to a changing
   climate, particularly when combined with climatic and oceanic process
   variables, together with knowledge of population and infrastructure.},

   sea level rise and coastal risks in local planning documents of southern
   France},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise and related risks are an aspect of climate change that
   deeply affects coastal areas worldwide and calls for adaptive responses.
   Spatial planning is one key to adaptation, in particular at local level,
   where coastal risks might be experienced and solutions need to be
   developed. However, local spatial planning is a complex process
   involving various governance levels and decision-makers in specific
   social, cultural, economic and geographical contexts. Focusing on
   Provence-Alpes-Co?te d?Azur region in southern France, this article
   proposes an analysis of the extent to which coastal risks are taken into
   account in the town planning documents of 65 coastal municipalities. The
   objective is to assess how seriously sea-level rise, coastal risks and
   adaptation are addressed in spatial planning. Results show that there is
   still a long way to go. Local development strategies often run counter
   to the idea of adapting, while local authorities and central government
   need to take a more collaborative approach. This work also shows the
   relevance of using spatial planning documents to reveal territories?
   attitudes to adaptive policies, and the crucial role played by
   interaction between decisional levels.},

Title = {Modeling climate change impacts on tidal marsh birds: Restoration and
   conservation planning in the face of uncertainty},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The large uncertainty surrounding the future effects of sea-level rise
   and other aspects of climate change on tidal marsh ecosystems
   exacerbates the difficulty in planning effective conservation and
   restoration actions. We addressed these difficulties in the context of
   large-scale wetland restoration activities underway in the San Francisco
   Estuary (Suisun, San Pablo and San Francisco Bays). We used a boosted
   regression tree approach to project the future distribution and
   abundance of five marsh bird species (through 2110) in response to
   changes in habitat availability and suitability as a result of projected
   sea-level rise, salinity, and sediment availability in the Estuary. To
   bracket the uncertainty, we considered four future scenarios based on
   two sediment availability scenarios (high or low), which varied
   regionally, and two rates of sea-level rise (0.52 or 1.65 m/100 yr). We
   evaluated three approaches for using model results to inform the
   selection of potential restoration projects: (1) Use current conditions
   only to prioritize restoration. (2) Use a single future scenario (among
   the four referred to above) in combination with current conditions to
   select priority restoration projects. (3) Combine current conditions
   with all four future scenarios, while incorporating uncertainty among
   future scenarios into the selection of restoration projects. We found
   that simply using current conditions resulted in the poorest performing
   restoration projects selected in terms of providing habitat for tidal
   marsh birds in light of possible future scenarios. The most robust
   method for selecting restoration projects, the ``combined{''} strategy,
   used projections from all future scenarios with a discounting of areas
   with high levels of variability among future scenarios. We show that
   uncertainty about future conditions can be incorporated in site
   prioritization algorithms and should motivate the selection of
   adaptation measures that are robust to uncertain future conditions.

Title = {Adaptation of fisheries and mariculture management to extreme oceanic
   environmental changes and climate variability in Taiwan},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {476-482},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study presents the response of fisheries management to the extreme
   climatic events that affect marine capture fisheries and mariculture in
   Taiwan. Two regional approaches that can be applied universally to help
   capture fisheries and mariculture adapt to extreme weather events are
   also proposed. In the winter of 2008, an anomalously strong and
   continuous northeasterly wind caused by a La Nina event drove the cold
   China Coastal Current southward to penetrate the southern Taiwan Strait,
   and a portion of this current intruded eastward to the southern Penghu
   Archipelago. The cold current intrusion appreciably damaged marine
   aquaculture and the wild fish population, causing the death of more than
   73 t of wild fish and 80\% of cage aquaculture fish at the Penghu
   Islands. This extremely cold seawater event occurred between late
   January and the beginning of February 2008. To recover fishery resources
   around the waters of Penghu, fishery-related agencies adapted recovery
   measures over 3 years starting in April 2008 that included hatchery
   juvenile release, environmental monitoring, fishery subsidies, and
   ecological field investigations. This study suggests that responding to
   extreme climatic influences on fisheries and mariculture should include
   (1) establishing an early warning system by connecting fisheries
   agencies and marine research institutions to assist decision makers in
   performing time-adaptive measures, (2) temporarily suspending fishing
   activities after the occurrence of a natural disaster to help recover
   fishery resources and ecosystems, (3) altering the governance of farming
   fishing right so that fish farmers can temporarily transfer their
   aquaculture cages from high-risk areas to waters outside the influence
   of extreme weather events, and (4) continually filing surveys to
   understand the recovery status of marine ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Responding to rising sea levels in the Mekong Delta},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-U167},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Vietnamese communities in the Mekong Delta are faced with the
   substantial impacts of rising sea levels and salinity intrusion. The
   construction of embankments and dykes has historically been the
   principal strategy of the Vietnamese government to mitigate the effects
   of salinity intrusion on agricultural production. A predicted sea-level
   rise of 30 cm by the year 2050 is expected to accelerate salinity
   intrusion. This study combines hydrologic, agronomic and behavioural
   assessments to identify effective adaptation strategies reliant on
   land-use change (soft options) and investments in water infrastructure
   (hard options). As these strategies are managed within different policy
   portfolios, the political discussion has polarized between choices of
   either soft or hard options. This paper argues that an ensemble of hard
   and soft policies is likely to provide the most effective results for

Title = {Spatiotemporal impact of vehicle heat on urban thermal environment: A
   case study in Hong Kong},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {205},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Vehicle heat (VH) is a substantial portion of anthropogenic heat and can
   affect the urban thermal environment. Quantifying the impact of VH has
   implications for the potential benefits of electric vehicles in cities,
   yet the spatiotemporal impact of VH has not been investigated
   separately. This study incorporates VH and urban landscape data into the
   Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to estimate the VH impacts
   at a fine spatial resolution over Hong Kong. Results show a strong
   temporal variation of the VH impact at daily, weekly, and seasonal
   scales: 1) the warmth of urban canyon air temperature is stronger and
   more consistent at night than in daytime, 2) increases in sensible heat
   fluxes are more pronounced during weekdays than weekends, 3) temperature
   change of 0.35 degrees C in winter is larger than that of 0.32 degrees C
   in summer. Increased air temperature over the land area by VH correlates
   with urban area fraction and building height positively, but not the
   aspect ratio. The statistically significant VH impact (90\% confidence
   level) has the broadest spatial coverage in Hong Kong shortly after rush
   hours. The relative VH impact compared to building heat demonstrates the
   dominative role of vehicle heat in warming low urbanized areas with
   highways and circulation roads. The spatiotemporal distributions of the
   VH impact provide insights into the potential benefits of green
   transportation technology and policy in mitigating urban heat islands.},

   testes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL},

Volume = {85},

Pages = {105-118},
Abstract = {Morphological changes of testes and the annual cycle of the seminiferous
   epithelium were observed by optical and transmission electron microscopy
   to determine the male reproductive cycle of the Korean greater horseshoe
   bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum korai. In this study, R. ferrumequinum
   korai showed a distinct reproductive cycle, unlike other hibernating bat
   species. The testicular reproductive cycle of R. ferrumequinum korai
   consists of three main stages. The first is the spermatogenesis stage
   (from April to September), including spermatocytogenesis (which appears
   from April to May) and spermiogenesis (from June to September). The
   activity of spermatogenesis was highest in August. The lumen of
   seminiferous tubules was open from mid-April to mid-October. It was
   closed from November to March of the following year. The second stage is
   the phagocytosis stage (from mid-October to mid-November), which is a
   purification process to prepare for new spermatogenesis the following
   year. This period is called the cleansing period. The third is the
   dormant stage - that is, a state of holding only spermatogonia and
   Sertoli cells. It is an adaptation strategy to store energy for long
   periods of hibernation. Compared to previous studies, spermatogenesis
   period preceded 1 month earlier. This suggests that temperature increase
   can impact reproductive development and spermatogenesis.},

Title = {In situ monitoring of microclimate and metabolic activity in lichens

Note = {11th Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Symposium, Barcelona,

Abstract = {Lichens are the dominant organisms in terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems
   and show a decline in species number, coverage, and growth rate from the
   maritime Antarctic (62 degrees S) to the McMurdo Dry Valleys (78 degrees
   S). While Livingston Island (maritime Antarctica) is a hot spot for
   lichen biodiversity, the McMurdo Dry Valleys (continental Antarctica)
   are known as one of the most extreme environments for life. Previous
   studies suggest the biodiversity gradient to be linked to water
   availability acting through length of active period, but no activity
   data are available for the Dry Valleys. The work presented here compares
   metabolic activity of lichens at Livingston Island and the Dry Valleys
   for 41/2 months from continuous monitoring that involves concurrent
   measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and microclimate. The
   latitudinal comparison involves two contrasting habitats for plant
   physiological activity and microclimate. Two species of the foliose
   genus Umbilicaria were monitored in both regions plus one sample of the
   crustose Caloplaca in the Dry Valleys. The results showed a very large
   difference in the duration of activity over the monitoring period, and
   this supports the different coverage, species abundance, and growth
   rates already reported for lichens between both regions. Despite this
   large difference in activity, and in habitat conditions, analysis of the
   activity behaviour of the two Umbilicaria species shows interesting
   common features, while the crustose Caloplaca had additional strategies
   to improve hydration. This offers one explanation for the abundance of
   crustose lichens inside the Valleys, indicating better adaptation
   strategies to a polar desert.},

Title = {The potential role of urban green areas for controlling ground surface
   and subsurface warming},
Journal = {URBAN WATER JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-44},
Abstract = {Subsurface warming in urban areas is higher in magnitude than increases
   in surface air temperatures. However, little evidence exists on the
   effects of urbanization on subsurface environments, and there are few
   quantitative estimates of the effectiveness of adaptation measures. We
   analyzed the relationship between ground surface warming and the extent
   of landscape change using subsurface temperature anomalies as an
   indicator of surface warming in five urban areas in Japan. To interpret
   these results for urban planning, we presented the percentages of green
   areas that would be needed to achieve certain reductions in ground
   surface temperatures for areas with different urbanization levels.
   Accordingly, a 0.5 degrees C reduction in average ground surface
   temperatures can be achieved by an increased Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index ( NDVI) value of 0.035, which accounts for
   approximately a 17\% increase in natural green areas in an area with
   75\% urbanization. This study provides quantitative estimates to cope
   with urban warming at the local scale in the face of climate change.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1363-1368},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, GHG inventories of cities have expanded to include
   extra-boundary activities that form part of the city's urban metabolism
   and economy. This paper centers on estimating the emissions due to
   seaports, in such a way that they can be included as part of the city's
   inventory or be used by the port itself to monitor their policy and
   technology improvements for mitigating climate change. We propose the
   indicators GHG emissions per ton of cargo handled or per passenger and
   emissions per value of cargo handled as practical measures for policy
   making and emission prevention measures to be monitored over time.
   Adapting existing methodologies to the Port of Barcelona, we calculated
   a total of 331,390 tons of GHG emissions (CO2 equivalents) for the year
   of 2008, half of which were attributed to vessel movement (sea-based
   emissions) and the other half to port, land related activities
   (land-based emissions). The highest polluters were auto carriers with 6
   kg of GHG emissions per ton of cargo handled. Knowing the highest
   emitters, the port can take action to improve the ship's activities
   within the port limits, such as maneuvering and hotelling. With these
   results, the port and the city can also find ways to reduce the
   land-based emissions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Conflicts over mitigation measures involve processes of contentious
   governance in which governmental and non-governmental players contest
   policies proposed or implemented by other governmental players or their
   business partners. Comparing a case of carbon capture and storage (CCS)
   with that of a nearshore windfarm in the Netherlands, I ask: how did
   local governmental players and their non-governmental allies succeed in
   getting the CCS project in Barendrecht taken off the table, while unable
   to block plans for the nearshore windfarm off the coast of Katwijk,
   Noordwijk and Zandvoort? Focusing on persuasion, I find that rhetorical
   framing based on expertise and `not in my backyard' (NIMBY) escapist
   framing did not make much difference in either case. In the CCS case, a
   process of scaling up procedural critique to the national level led to
   repeal of the plan. A similar process did not happen in the windfarm
   case.},

   climate resilience strategies. We grounded our study in the Social
   Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), which despite its longevity and
   wide usage has rarely been used to understand the role of government
   actors. We found substantial complexity in how these government
   representatives develop both amplifying and attenuating communication
   strategies as they often simultaneously reach multiple audiences holding
   different perspectives. They are familiar with and employ risk
   communication practices. However, they report needing to modify their
   efforts as climate adaptation issues and goals evolve over time, and
   experiment in situations, such as discussions of retreat, where
   established communication practices provide insufficient guidance. In
   order to develop a deeper understanding of the governmental risk
   communication actors, we suggest four potential avenues for taking
   advantage of the strengths of SARF as a framework for connecting and
   integrating with other models and theories. We also propose several
   directions for research based on the challenges these practitioners are
   finding in their work to facilitate adaptation to climate risks. The
   activity of government actors is rich in its applied risk communication
   practice and its challenges offer new questions to expand our thinking
   about the SARF and risk communication more broadly.},

Title = {Economics over Risk: Flooding Is Not the Only Driving Factor of

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {We analyzed the migration consideration factors of residents from the
   Mississippi River Delta in southern Louisiana, which is under the
   influence of rising sea levels, subsiding land, and increasing flood
   risks. Through the use of a telephone survey of 1,125 adult individuals
   in twenty-four parishes, we gathered the demographic data and flood risk
   experiences and perceptions of each respondent. The data were analyzed
   through descriptive statistics, means comparisons, and logistic
   regression to determine the factors with the highest influence on
   migration consideration. Results show that 21.5 percent of respondents
   considered moving, and they were mostly renters, were mostly younger,
   had experienced flooding before, and were less satisfied with their
   current living condition. Flood risk was found to be an important
   deciding factor, but it is not the most important one. Instead, economic
   opportunities have a greater effect on respondents' desire to move or
   stay. The findings provide useful information and insights into the
   planning and management of a flood-prone region and whether managed
   retreat or other mitigation measures would be effective.},

Title = {Comparison of a simple hydrostatic and a data-intensive 3D numerical
   modeling method of simulating sea-level rise induced groundwater
   inundation for Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Groundwater inundation (GWI) is a particularly challenging consequence
   of sea-level rise (SLR), as it progressively inundates infrastructure
   located above and below the ground surface. Paths of flooding by GWI
   differ from other types of SLR flooding (i.e., wave overwash,
   storm-drain backflow) such that it is more difficult to mitigate, and
   thus requires a separate set of highly innovative adaptation strategies
   to manage. To spur consideration of GWI in planning, data-intensive
   numerical modeling methods have been developed that produce locally
   specific visualizations of GWI, though the accessibility of such methods
   is limited by extensive data requirements. Conversely, the hydrostatic
   (or `bathtub') modeling approach is widely used in adaptation planning
   owing to easily accessed visualizations (i.e., NOAA SLR Viewer), yet its
   capacity to simulate GWI has never been tested. Given the separate
   actions necessary to mitigate GWI relative to marine overwash, this is a
   significant gap. Here we compare a simple hydrostatic modeling method
   with a more deterministic, dynamic and robust 3D numerical modeling
   approach to explore the effectiveness of the hydrostatic method in
   simulating equilibrium aquifer effects of multi-decadal sea-level rise,
   and in turn GWI for Honolulu, Hawai'i. We find hydrostatic modeling in
   the Honolulu area and likely other settings may yield similar results to
   numerical modeling when referencing the local mean higher-high water
   tide datum (generally typical of flood studies). These findings have the
   potential to spur preliminary understanding of GWI impacts in
   municipalities that lack the required data to conduct rigorous
   groundwater-modeling investigations. We note that the methods explored
   here for Honolulu do not simulate dynamic coastal processes (i.e.,
   coastal erosion, sediment accretion or changes in land cover) and thus
   are most appropriately applied to regions that host heavily armored
   shorelines behind which GWI can develop.},

Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In the small city of Dunedin, on the south-east coast of Aotearoa New
   Zealand, sea-level rise and increased flood events are affecting
   communities. The potential for climate change impacts in South Dunedin
   to exacerbate existing inequalities is high. Floods in 2015 became a
   catalyst for a different way of `doing' climate change adaptation
   suggesting more care-full and just intentions and practices. Drawing
   from both local authority and community actions, we document how care
   has become the basis for a meaningful way to bring justice to the
   forefront of the early stages of adaptation planning. We document how
   Tronto's (2013) caring with is demonstrated in a significant shift in
   the relationship between and within affected communities and the Council
   since the floods. The nature of this partnership work is evident through
   community initiatives and the Council's approach to community
   engagement, both of which are providing spaces in which adaptation
   discussions are becoming easier, the emotional dimensions of climate
   change impacts can be expressed, and where embodied care work is justice
   work. We argue that just adaptation invokes care, and that care and
   justice are co-constituted when the moral dimensions of caring with are
   institutionalised in both community and local authority adaptive
   practices.},

Abstract = {Under conditions of continuous global warming, research into the future
   change trends of regional dry-wet climates is key for coping with and
   adapting to climate change, and is also an important topic in the field
   of climate change prediction. In this study, daily precipitation and
   mean temperature datasets under four representative concentrative
   pathway (RCP) scenarios in the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory
   Earth system model with modular ocean model (GFDL-ESM2M) version 4 were
   used to calculate the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration
   index of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at different time scales. Using a
   multi-analytical approach including the Mann-Kendall trend test and run
   theory, the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of drought in the
   TP from 2016 to 2099 were studied. The results show that the overall
   future climate of the TP will develop towards warm and humid, and that
   the monthly-scale wet-dry changes will develop non-uniformly. As the
   concentration of carbon dioxide emissions increases in the future, the
   proportion of extremely significant aridification and humidification
   areas in the TP will significantly increase, and the possibility of
   extreme disasters will also increase. Moreover, influenced by the
   increase of annual TP precipitation, the annual scale of future drought
   in the region will tend to decrease slightly, and the spatial
   distributions of the frequency and intensity of droughts at all levels
   will develop uniformly. Under all four RCP scenarios, the drought
   duration of the TP was mainly less than 3 months, and the drought cycle
   in the southern region was longer than that in the northern region. The
   results of this study provide a new basis for the development of
   adaptive measures for the TP to cope with climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the transfer of property rights as an active
   strategic tool that defines space (re) production, development,
   protection, and management processes and presents a creative approach
   and a perspective for urban resilience by an alternative land management
   model proposal. The discussion in this paper largely differs from the
   understanding of the concept both by the planning institution and the
   majority of academic studies. While the planning institution approaches
   the transfer of property rights as a passive ingredient, academic
   studies focus mainly on the outcomes of this transfer in economic terms
   and they fail in defining the necessary strategies, policies, and
   regulatory tools to decrease risk and negative impacts. The alternative
   approach presented in this paper suggests that property rights as a
   creative approach and policy tool for urban resilience should be
   examined on the basis of the relationship between partial interests in
   property; relative to value, land use, the location and the amount and
   type of real property transactions. A coastal region in Turkey where all
   types of historical, cultural, and natural resources are concentrated,
   but rapidly destroyed with the pressure of tourism, energy investments,
   and secondary housing is selected as a case for the analysis of the
   effects of the property market with the planning/urbanization problems
   in the region. The case study takes into account the internet data of
   transfer values by property types in the year 2008. The case study is
   used for presenting an administrative model that is implemented through
   and understanding for spatial planning to achieve urban resilience. This
   understanding is based on the concepts of integrated coastal zone and
   protection area management that are realized by controlling and
   directing transfers in order to limit the impact of the market and
   planning institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ectotherms are exposed to a range of environmental temperatures and may
   face extremes beyond their upper thermal limits. Such temperature
   extremes can stimulate aerobic metabolism toward its maximum, a decline
   in aerobic substrate oxidation, and a parallel increase of anaerobic
   metabolism, combined with ROS generation and oxidative stress. Under
   these stressful conditions, marine organisms recruit several defensive
   strategies for their maintenance and survival. However, thermal
   tolerance of ectothermic organisms may be increased after a brief
   exposure to sub-lethal temperatures, a process known as ``hardening{''}.
   In our study, we examined the ability of M. galloprovincialis to
   increase its thermal tolerance under the effect of elevated temperatures
   (24, 26 and 28 degrees C) through the ``hardening{''} process. Our
   results demonstrate that this process can increase the heat tolerance
   and antioxidant defense of heat hardened mussels through more efficient
   ETS activity when exposed to temperatures beyond 24 degrees C, compared
   to non-hardened individuals. Enhanced cell protection is reflected in
   better adaptive strategies of heat hardened mussels, and thus decreased
   mortality. Although hardening seems a promising process for the

Title = {Tsunami hazard in the Caribbean: Regional exposure derived from credible
   worst case scenarios},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {1-23},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The present study documents a high tsunami hazard in the Caribbean
   region, with several thousands of lives lost in tsunamis and associated
   earthquakes since the XIXth century. Since then, the coastal population
   of the Caribbean and the Central West Atlantic region has grown
   significantly and is still growing. Understanding this hazard is
   therefore essential for the development of efficient mitigation
   measures. To this end, we report a regional tsunami exposure assessment
   based on potential and credible seismic and non-seismic tsunamigenic
   sources. Regional tsunami databases have been compiled and reviewed, and
   on this basis five main scenarios have been selected to estimate the
   exposure. The scenarios comprise two M(w)8 earthquake tsunamis (north of
   Hispaniola and east of Lesser Antilles), two subaerial/submarine volcano
   flank collapse tsunamis (Montserrat and Saint Lucia), and one tsunami
   resulting from a landslide on the flanks of the Kick'em Jenny submarine
   volcano (north of Grenada). Offshore tsunami water surface elevations as
   well as maximum water level distributions along the shore lines are
   computed and discussed for each of the scenarios. The number of exposed
   people has been estimated in each case, together with a summary of the
   tsunami exposure for the earthquake and the landslide tsunami scenarios.
   For the earthquake scenarios, the highest tsunami exposure relative to
   the population is found for Guadeloupe (6.5\%) and Antigua (7.5\%),
   while Saint Lucia (4.5\%) and Antigua (5\%) have been found to have the
   highest tsunami exposure relative to the population for the landslide
   scenarios. Such high exposure levels clearly warrant more attention on
   dedicated mitigation measures in the Caribbean region. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Estuaries are coastal systems particularly vulnerable to climate change.
   Within these systems, agriculture is one of the most potentially
   affected sectors. This paper proposes a risk assessment approach for
   helping the decision-making process at a local level, addressing two
   risks that affect agricultural areas located in estuarine margins: the
   unavailability of freshwater for irrigation resulting from the upstream
   propagation of estuarine brackish water during droughts and land
   inundation by high water levels associated with high tides and storm
   surges. For each risk, quantitative consequence descriptors are proposed
   to support risk level determination and evaluation through a continuous
   consequence-probability diagram. The approach applicability is discussed
   through its application to the Lezfria Grande de Vila Franca de Xira,
   located in the Tagus Estuary (Portugal). Results indicate that the
   approach is appropriate to support risk owners in taking actions to
   mitigate the risk. Examples of risk control measures for the risks
   addressed are presented. The main strengths of the proposed approach are
   its flexibility to be adapted to local conditions and updated through
   time, as well as the ease of its application by the risk owner.},

Title = {Effectiveness of land management measures to reduce coastal georisks,
   eastern Quebec, Canada},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {290-301},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Erosion and flooding are geohazards that pose a significant problem in
   eastern Quebec, as they do throughout the world. To manage such risks,
   zoning to set limits on new construction projects is generally the first
   adaptation solution introduced in an area. However, very few studies
   have evaluated the effectiveness of zoning in terms of risk reduction.
   Offered here is a retrospective approach to evaluate the evolution of
   settlement in coastal areas before and during the progressive
   implementation of zoning laws and regulations in the Perce region of
   eastern Quebec, Canada. It was possible to evaluate the evolution of the
   built environment and coastal hazards by using 6 series of aerial
   photographs (1934-2001) and archived processed in a GIS. The results
   show a significant change in coastal land use. At first land use was
   consistent with a fishery-based economy, and later with an economy based
   on the tourism industry. Such a transformation in human activity leads
   to changes in the typology of the built environment, and consequently to
   an increase in the value of buildings at risk. Due to widespread
   ignorance respecting the intensity of hazards and the rhythm of coastal
   evolution, a lack of understanding and acceptance of land management
   regulations, an excessive level of confidence respecting anti-erosion
   protective structures and conscious risk taking by property owners
   seeking to take advantage of the coast's attractiveness among others for
   tourism purposes, the implementation of land use planning and
   development laws and regulations in the 1980s was not able to limit the
   number of buildings at risk in the coastal zone. In fact, a 133\%
   increase in buildings at risk was observed between 1980 and 2001. Only
   one quarter of this increase can be attributed to the coastline's
   movement caused by erosion, whereas 74\% of the buildings newly at risk
   were new, built in a zone where building was prohibited. Poorly adapted
   measures that limited risks over an insufficient period were also
   observed. Such observations reveal a problem of governance respecting
   the management and prevention of natural coastal hazards. While it may
   be useful to redefine measures for the zoning of coastal risks with
   precision and based on criteria that take into account the dynamics of
   coastal hazards, zoning on its own is no guarantee of risk reduction.
   Such zoning measures must be developed and applied along with a strategy
   for communicating hazards and risk to all actors in the coastal zone.
   Due to the complexity of the problems involved, reinforcing adaptive
   capacities of coastal communities with respect to coastal hazards
   requires a process whose efficiency is ensured by close collaboration
   among the various actors (scientists, managers, levels of government,
   the general public). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fishing for the impacts of climate change in the marine sector: a case
   study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {421-441},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims, using a case study-based research approach,
   to investigate the role of climate and non-climate drivers in shaping
   three commercial marine sectors: fishing, aquaculture and marine
   tourism. Essential elements of climate change research include taking a
   whole of systems approach, which entails a socio-ecological perspective,
   and considering climate challenges alongside other challenges faced by
   resource users.
   Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on information
   gained using in-depth semi-structured interviews in a coastal community
   in southeast Australia. Even though climate drivers differ, the economic
   sectors of this community are representative of many similar coastal
   communities around Australia.
   Findings - Results show that at a community level, people involved in,
   or associated with, marine sectors are aware of climate change impacts
   on the marine environment. Even though many may not see it as a pressing
   issue, the potential effect of climate change on business profitability
   was recognised. Both the profitability of commercial fishing and
   aquaculture (oysters) was affected through mostly a downward pressure on
   product price, while marine tourism profitability was mainly affected
   through changes in the number of visitors.
   Research limitations/implications - A case study approach is inherently
   case study-specific although generalities from complex system
   representation, built on local survey respondent observation and
   knowledge of the combined and linked physical-biological-, social-,
   economic-and governance drivers. This study shows the importance of a
   holistic approach; yet, researchers must also consider all community
   sectors and cross-regional investigations to avoid future resource
   conflicts.
   Practical implications - A number of positive impacts from
   climate-driven change, mainly from windfall economic benefits of
   geographically relocated species, were reported for commercial-and
   charter fishing. However, no positive impacts were reported for the
   aquaculture- and dive sector. In the aquaculture sector, climate drivers
   were of great significance in industry participation, while
   participation in commercial fishing was mainly driven by socio-economic
   factors.
   Social implications - To ensure the combined marine sectors retain a
   viable component of coastal communities' economic focus, there is a need
   to understand what drives participation in the marine sector, and what
   the role of climate change is in this. To fully understand the
   ramifications of climate change in the marine environment, it is
   essential to understand its impacts across all marine sectors.
   Originality/value - Combining the different domains with climate drivers
   allows for identification and assessment of targeted adaptation needs
   and opportunities and sets up a comprehensive approach to determine
   future adaptation pathways.},

Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change, comprising of changes in precipitation patterns, higher
   temperatures and sea level rises, increases the likelihood of future
   flooding in the Betna River basin, Bangladesh. Hydrodynamic modelling
   was performed to simulate the present and future water level and
   discharge for different scenarios using bias-corrected, downscaled data
   from two general circulation models. The modelling results indicated
   that, compared to the baseline year (2014-2015), the water level is
   expected to increase by 11-16\% by the 2040s and 14-23\% by the 2090s,
   and the monsoon daily maximum discharge is expected to increase by up to
   13\% by the 2040s and 21\% by the 2090s. Sea level rise is mostly
   responsible for the increase in water level. The duration of water level
   exceedance of the established danger threshold and extreme discharge
   events can increase by up to half a month by the 2040s and above one
   month by the 2090s. The combined influence of the increased water level
   and discharge has the potential to cause major floods in the Betna River
   basin. The results of our study increase the knowledge base on climate
   change influence on water level and discharge at a local scale. This is
   valuable for water managers in flood-risk mitigation and water
   management.},

Title = {Complete genome sequence of a multiple-stress-tolerant bacterium
   Halomonas piezotolerans NBT06E8(T) isolated from a deep-sea sediment
   sample of the New Britain Trench},

Abstract = {Halomonas piezotolerans NBT06E8(T) is a Gram-stain-negative, moderately
   halophilic, piezotolerant, H2O2 and heavy metal-resistant bacterium,
   isolated from a deep-sea sediment sample collected from the New Britain
   Trench at depth of 8900 m. Growth of the strain was observed at 4-45
   degrees C (optimum 30 degrees C), at pH 5-11 (optimum 8-9) and in
   0.5-21\% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 3-7\%). The optimum pressure for growth was
   0.1-30 MPa (megapascal) with tolerance up to 60 MPa. Under optimum
   growth conditions, the strain could tolerant 15 mM H2O2. Here, we report
   the complete genome of H. piezotolerans NBT06E8(T), which consists of
   3,945,801 bp (G + C content of 57.93\%) with a single chromosome, 3509
   protein-coding genes, 60 tRNAs and 6 rRNA operons. Genomic analysis
   revealed the capability of utilizing various carbon and nitrogen
   sources, the presence of multiple toxin-antitoxin systems and
   strain-specific type VI secretion system benefitting its adaptation to
   the oligotrophic hadal environments. Multiple respiratory chain
   components, especially the strain-specific anaerobic enzymes, could
   allow its survival in both surficial and buried sediments with variable
   oxygen concentrations. Gene function and metabolic pathway analysis
   showed that strain NBT06E8(T) encodes a series of genes related to high
   hydrostatic pressure tolerance, antioxidative stress and heavy metal
   resistance, which could also contribute to its deep-sea adaptation
   strategies. The complete genome sequence of H. piezotolerans NBT06E8(T)
   provides further insights into the stress adaptation strategies of
   deep-sea bacteria and potential biotechnological application of
   Halomonas species.},

Title = {Paucispecific macroinvertebrate communities in the Upper Cretaceous of
   El Hassana Dome (Abu Roash, Egypt): Environmental controls vs adaptive
   strategies},
Journal = {CRETACEOUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {120-136},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Based on rock and fossil data from the Upper Cretaceous of the El
   Hassana Dome (Abu Roash, Egypt), factors controlling facies architecture
   and the nature of biotopes are highlighted. The succession formed on a
   non-rimmed shelf, the architecture of which varied from an inner to an
   outer shelf setting upsection. Macrobenthic biotopes are reconstructed
   and their palaeoecological significance assessed using a novel ternary
   plot. Based on diversity and community structure (770 specimens assigned
   to 28 bivalve and gastropod taxa), four paucispecific associations are
   identified. These are: 1. the `Cucullaea' Assemblage, a low-energy,
   soft-substrate, oligotrophic outer shelf environment with reduced
   terrigenous input dominated by infaunal bivalves and hexactinellid
   sponges; 2. the `Plicatula' Assemblage, a low energy, restricted inner
   shelf lagoonal setting with soupy substrates and dysoxia below the
   sediment water interface dominated by plicatulid and ostreid bivalves,
   3. the `Durania' Assemblage, a high-energy, high-temperature, shoal
   environment dominated by elevator rudists with minor numbers of
   echinoids, corals and bryozoans, which together form several biostromes.
   and 4. The `Trochactaeon' Assemblage, which share the same
   characteristics of the Durania' Assemblage. The paucispecific nature of
   these biotopes is indicative of different stress factors. Consequently,
   the predominant taxa exhibit different degrees.of adaptive strategies.
   In addition to global sea level, local tectonics have significantly
   affected facies distribution and biotope structure. The shallower facies
   during the early Turonian and the dysoxia spanning the
   Coniacian-Santonian were linked to synsedimentary tectonics, which
   formed many barriers and led to circulation restrictions. (C) 2017

Title = {Human-centric microclimate analysis of Urban Heat Island: Wearable
   sensing and data-driven techniques for identifying mitigation strategies
   in New York City},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is the best acknowledged climate-change related
   phenomenon also because it affects population health conditions in dense
   urban areas, even exacerbated during heat waves. While most of field
   studies are performed by means of permanent weather stations, this paper
   presents an intra-urban microclimate analysis through wearable sensing
   techniques for monitoring and characterizing granular peculiarities as
   perceived by urban pedestrians. The study is implemented in four areas
   of New York City presenting already mitigation techniques. These
   strategies are specifically analyzed from the pedestrians' perspective,
   who may walk along parks and sidewalks, to better study real boundary
   conditions responsible for thermal perception, even in those areas where
   vehicles are not allowed. A novel cluster analysis procedure is then
   carried out to perform data-driven identification of urban microclimate
   peculiarities in relation to its morphology (e.g. urban canyons etc.).
   Results show a non-negligible dependency from urban configuration both
   in winter and in summer. Measurements in the high-packed district winter
   daytime show a drop off of 0.6 degrees C in air temperature close to
   small parks. The packed low-rise district presents highest values of
   CO2, with respect to the other monitored areas both in winter and in
   summer. The same areas are automatically recognized through the
   data-driven clustering process. The data-driven approach may be
   therefore successfully integrated into classic measurements to
   investigate UHI and heat stress in dense anthropized areas.},

Abstract = {The successful protection and management of marine ecosystems depend on
   understanding the capability of biota for recovering after stressor
   mitigation actions are taken. Here we present long-term changes
   (1984-2012) in degraded subtidal assemblages following the
   implementation of the sewerage scheme for the metropolitan area of
   Bilbao (1 million inhabitants). Qualitative and quantitative species
   composition of disturbed vegetation shifted over time, making it more
   similar to that of the reference assemblages considered. Species density
   in the disturbed habitats increased, which is also a positive sign of
   recovery. However, eleven years after the clean-up was completed,
   canopy-forming macrophytes showed no signs of recovery. We argue that
   the ecological resilience of the ecosystem may have been eroded after a
   long-standing pollution perturbation and that underlying climate change
   could be influencing the recovery trajectory of the degraded
   assemblages. The implications of these conclusions for the
   implementation of European marine environmental legislation are
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Number = {F1},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {As humans increasingly occupy and modify marginal landscapes, previously
   unobserved long timescale, emergent behaviors related to interactions
   between natural processes and human agency are possible. Barrier
   islands, which are low-lying strips of sand separated from a coast by
   lagoons, cut by inlets and topped by sand dunes, have been significantly
   modified through the development of tourist resorts. Resorts and barrier
   islands are dynamically coupled through storm damage and beach erosion,
   and measures taken to prevent or mitigate them. In response to rising
   sea level, a natural barrier island migrates steadily up the continental
   shelf. In contrast, we show that in a novel numerical model-coupling
   barrier island processes with resort development, storm damage, and
   hazard mitigation, policy decisions driven by market dynamics
   destabilize barrier island response to rising sea level, giving rise to
   emergent, episodic boom and bust cycles, which alternate in phase
   alongshore, and less frequent, regionally extensive resort destruction
   events. Developed barrier islands are precariously maintained at lower
   elevations and further offshore than their natural counterparts, a
   situation exacerbated by insurance, which can lead to island inundation.
   Our results suggest that coastal areas that have recently instituted
   protection measures eventually will experience a widespread upsurge in
   damage if these practices are sustained, even in the absence of
   climate-change-induced increased storminess.},

Title = {Annual and intra-annual climate variability and change of the Volta
   Delta, Ghana},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Deltas are geographically and socio-ecologically distinct systems, with
   a unique climate and contextually high vulnerabilities to climate
   dynamics. Hence, they require specific climate change adaptation and
   policy responses, informed by delta-scale analysis. However, available
   climate knowledge on deltas is based mainly on broad-scale analysis that
   masks information unique to deltas. This applies to the Volta Delta
   system of Ghana. This study presents annual and intra-annual climate
   variability and trend analysis carried out across the Volta Delta, using
   the coefficient of variation (CV), anomaly, Mann-Kendall and Pettit
   statistics. There were time and space differences in climate change and
   variability. Statistically significant (P<0.05) positive trends were
   observed for the major wet season and the mean annual rainfall for Ada
   and highly significant (P<0.01) positive trends for Akatsi. These
   contrasted with the observations in Adidome, which experienced a
   statistically highly significant (P<0.01) decreasing trend in rainfall.
   There were significant (P<0.05) increases in annual minimum, maximum,
   and mean temperatures over time in both coastal and inland delta
   stations. The annual rate of change of mean temperature ranged from 0.03
   to 0.05. Ada, the more coastal location, has experienced a narrow range
   of temperature change, most probably due to the buffering capacity of
   the ocean. Point changes were observed in the climate data series in
   four (4) localities. We recommend that adaption and policy actions
   should include, the provision of small-scale irrigation, encouraging
   adoption of drought-resistant crop varieties and crop diversification,
   and also be made responsive to the existing spatiotemporal climate
   variability and change within the Volta Delta.},

Title = {Challenging the obsession with local level institutions in country
   ownership of climate change adaptation},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Working with local level actors to enable country ownership is applauded
   within the multilateral climate finance landscape. However, are emerging
   adaptation interventions equitable by reflecting the priorities of local
   level vulnerable populations? This research sought to find out whether
   the engagement of local institutions in projects that seek to achieve
   country ownership enabled local level vulnerable groups to participate
   in and influence adaptation decision-making processes and outcomes,
   thereby enabling them to have a voice in local level adaptation. It used
   a case study of a Global Environmental Facility-managed coastal
   adaptation project in Tanzania, which sought to restore and protect
   mangroves to enable adaptation to sea level rise. Data was generated
   from 13 Focus Group Discussions and survey questionnaires administered
   to 629 individuals in three locations on the mainland of Tanzania and in
   Zanzibar. The findings indicate that community-based organizations were
   used to facilitate the implementation of project activities at the
   community level. However, participation spaces created in the project
   and facilitated by these local institutions were exclusionary and failed
   to enable vulnerable community groups to have a voice on mangrove
   restoration and protection. Use of these local institutions altered
   local level power relations and disempowered other pre-existing and
   (in)formal local resource management institutions. Community members
   questioned legitimacy of actions implemented by these local
   institutions. These findings suggest that working with local level
   stakeholders to generate country ownership does not automatically
   guarantee that actions will address the needs of local vulnerable
   groups. Multilateral climate finance institutions should acknowledge
   these risks and implement measures to address them.},

Abstract = {Corporate Social Responsibility is a voluntary strategy by companies,
   which integrates a set of actions that contribute to sustainable
   development. This study analyzes the degree of involvement of marine
   tourism companies in human resource management, adaptation to change,
   environmental management, local community development and collaboration
   with public and private agents. These areas configure companies'
   Corporate Social Responsibility strategies. Information was collected
   from marine tourism companies on the island of Tenerife using
   quantitative and qualitative methodologies. A binary logistic regression
   analysis was applied. The results indicate that, in general, marine
   tourism companies are socio-environmentally responsible. Environmental
   aspects and adaptation to change through innovation have the greatest
   weight in these companies' Corporate Social Responsibility strategies.
   Actions for local community development and collaboration with private
   agents are also important. However, human resource management influences
   negatively since marine tourism is a highly regulated sector in this
   regard. Thus, actions are mandatory and not voluntary, affecting all
   companies equally whether they have high levels of Corporate Social
   Responsibility implementation or not. Regarding relations with public
   authorities, the results indicate that improvement is urgently required,
   given the low participation of marine tourism companies in policy
   making.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) caused by climate change presents challenges for
   public planners all over the world. In this study, practical challenges
   and ethical factors in adaptation to SLR were identified based on
   interviews with planners in Sweden. Six challenges were identified: lack
   of knowledge and human resources, lacking integration and coordination,
   lacking or insufficient frameworks for dealing with long-time-horizons,
   responsibility for implementation and financing, and goal conflicts in
   the process of implementing adaptation policy. These challenges are then
   developed into a typology of ethical factors that are of particular
   importance for adaptation to SLR, categorised as input-oriented,
   process-oriented and outcome-oriented ethical factors. The challenges
   and ethical factors identified in this paper are the first step taken
   towards answering the question of what a sustainable and ethical
   adaptation to SLR in the context of local and regional policy-making
   could look like.},

   Georgia, British Columbia, Canada},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {Global changes manifest themselves in coastal waters depending on local
   oceanography and ecosystems. In this paper, we consider the Strait of
   Georgia as a case study. After examining physical and chemical processes
   and trends, we discuss consequences of change on geochemical cycling and
   biota. Several components of the system are vulnerable. Declines in pH
   and O-2 of basin waters, partly imported from the shelf and partly
   supported by carbon cycling within the strait, could reduce benthic and
   pelagic habitat. Sea level rise and storms will interact with coastal
   development to place critical habitat, such as low-lying estuaries,
   intertidal zones and mudflats, at risk. The decrease and earlier peak in
   zooplankton biomass may lead to changes in the food web that cascade to
   higher trophic levels such as fish and birds. Anadromous fish, already
   showing declines, are vulnerable to ocean regime shifts, increasing
   river temperatures, habitat destruction, harvesting and contaminants.
   For southern resident killer whales Orcinus orca, a species at risk,
   decline in Chinook salmon Oncorhynch us tshawytscha together with marine
   traffic and biomagnifying contaminants will lead to extirpation if no
   action is taken. Some stressors can be controlled only through
   international action to mitigate climate change. However, we have local
   control of fishing, habitat destruction, release of some contaminants
   and, to some extent, river flow and temperature. Acting to control these
   stressors will support resilience of biota in the face of inevitable
   global changes.},

Title = {Impact of storm Xynthia in 2010 on coastal agricultural areas: the Saint

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1177-1190},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Storm Xynthia crossed France's western coast between 28th February and
   1st March 2010. It hit the Vendee and Charente-Maritime departments
   hardest, as storm surge flooded up to 23,000ha of coastal agricultural
   areas (i.e. polders), causing severe damage to farming operations.
   However, farm-level damage in the aftermath of seawater flooding is an
   issue that has rarely been explored in the literature. Here we
   investigated the effects of storm Xynthia on agriculture at the farm
   scale. We focused on the case study of Saint Laurent de la Pree research
   farm, a mixed crop-livestock system that was severely hit. All damages
   were described and economic losses were quantified for the years 2010
   and 2011. The results show numerous consequences of the storm in terms
   of crop and fodder production losses, but also farm infrastructure
   repairs, crop restoration and animal health problems. Economic damage
   costs were high, reaching Euro71,720 in 2010 (Euro500/ha flooded) and
   Euro56,195 (Euro390/ha) in 2011 for the case study farm. The discussion
   highlights the farm-level impacts of seawater flooding and the crucial
   factors that can explain the damage caused to agriculture by storm
   events in coastal areas. The results are also discussed in the wider
   context of global warming which is expected to cause sea level rise and
   more frequent storm events in the future. The vulnerability of coastal
   agricultural areas to storms thus exposes broader issues of coastal
   flooding risk management and specifically the allied
   protection-remediation-adaptation measures. The conclusions underline
   the need for future research to address prospective scenarios and
   subsequent adaptive strategies.},

Title = {Managed retreat of coastal communities: understanding responses to
   projected sea level rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {4},
Pages = {409-433},
Abstract = {Managed retreat - the relocation of homes and infrastructure under
   threat from coastal flooding - is one of the few policy options
   available for coastal communities facing long-term risks from
   accelerated sea level rise. At present, little is known about how the
   Australian public perceives policy options to mitigate sea level rise
   risks. This paper explores a range of different decision-making criteria
   used to assess a managed retreat scheme. A metatheoretical social
   functionalist framework is used to make sense of personal concerns
   elicited from an online survey asking respondents to consider a managed
   retreat scheme. The framework proposes that people can act intuitively
   as scientists, economists, politicians, prosecutors and theologians,
   when considering a complex topic such as managed retreat policy. The
   research found that the survey respondents are more likely to consider
   the topic of managed retreat from multiple functional perspectives than
   from a single functional perspective. The type of social functionalist
   frameworks that people used to assess the Conditional Occupancy Rights
   scheme was found to be influenced by their perceptions of sea level rise
   risk. The findings have implications for public debates about the
   long-term risks of sea level rise and for engaging with the community
   about managed retreat policy options.},

Title = {Reshaping the concept of transit-oriented development in response to
   public space overheating near the transit nodes of Tokyo},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {116},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In Tokyo, the overheating of public spaces in summer is a challenging
   issue that needs to be resolved for the vibrant social life in this city
   to be sustained. The urbanisation of Tokyo is based on transit-oriented
   developments (TODs); this study focused on understanding the correlation
   between the urban heat island (UHI) effect and public spaces within TODs
   and on providing solutions for mitigating the overheating of such
   spaces. The onsite microclimatic data of 30 public spaces near transit
   nodes were compared with average daily weather forecast data to identify
   the overheating levels. The spatial structures of the selected areas
   were then analysed to identify possible planning issues that led to the
   overheating. Public spaces with high-overheating levels tended to have a
   lack of vegetation and to be small, dry, and blocked from the wind flow.
   Public spaces that were not overheated tended to be wide, green, and
   shaded. These spaces had a microclimate similar to the daily weather
   forecast. These findings were used to develop new planning guidelines
   for improving TODs, developing overheating mitigation strategies for
   public spaces, and identifying future directions for sustainable
   improvement of the urban structure.},

Title = {The role of ecosystems in coastal protection: Adapting to climate change
   and coastal hazards},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {50-57},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems, particularly intertidal wetlands and reefs (coral
   and shellfish), can play a critical role in reducing the vulnerability
   of coastal communities to rising seas and coastal hazards, through their
   multiple roles in wave attenuation, sediment capture, vertical
   accretion, erosion reduction and the mitigation of storm surge and
   debris movement. There is growing understanding of the array of factors
   that affect the strength or efficacy of these ecosystem services in
   different locations, as well as management interventions which may
   restore or enhance such values. Improved understanding and application
   of such knowledge will form a critical part of coastal adaptation
   planning, likely reducing the need for expensive engineering options in
   some locations, and providing a complementary tool in hybrid engineering
   design. Irrespective of future climate change, coastal hazards already
   impact countless communities and the appropriate use of ecosystem-based
   adaptation strategies offers a valuable and effective tool for
   present-day management. Maintaining and enhancing coastal systems will
   also support the continued provision of other coastal services,
   including the provision of food and maintenance of coastal resource
   dependent livelihoods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Relocation as an Adaptation to Sea-Level Rise: Valuable Lessons from the
   Narikoso Village Relocation Project in Fiji},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Relocation as an adaptation strategy to coastal degradation remains on
   the fringes of climate change discourse. Yet, as sea levels are
   projected to rise, relocating is an inevitable response for vulnerable
   coastal communities worldwide. In fact, some Fijian villages are facing
   such severe coastal erosion that they have already begun the process of
   shifting to higher ground, and many more villages throughout the islands
   have been slated for relocation. This case study is based on the planned
   relocation efforts of Narikoso village on Ono Island in Kadavu, Fiji. In
   Narikoso, regional NGOs, INGOs, and local and national government are
   working with the community to relocate the village inland. The process
   of moving the community began in 2012 when Prime Minister Bainimarama
   sent the Fiji military to Ono Island to clear land for the new village.
   It came to an abrupt stop due to a lack of funding and ecological
   degradation caused by the preparation for the new village site. Since
   the relocation process began, a myriad of issues have arisen ranging
   from concerns regarding community engagement, availability of financial
   resources, and resistance to moving inland.},

Title = {Climate change and biological invasions: evidence, expectations, and
   response options},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1297-1313},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A changing climate may directly or indirectly influence biological
   invasions by altering the likelihood of introduction or establishment,
   as well as modifying the geographic range, environmental impacts,
   economic costs or management of alien species. A comprehensive
   assessment of empirical and theoretical evidence identified how each of
   these processes is likely to be shaped by climate change for alien
   plants, animals and pathogens in terrestrial, freshwater and marine
   environments of Great Britain. The strongest contemporary evidence for
   the potential role of climate change in the establishment of new alien
   species is for terrestrial arthropods, as a result of their ectothermic
   physiology, often high dispersal rate and their strong association with
   trade as well as commensal relationships with human environments. By
   contrast, there is little empirical support for higher temperatures
   increasing the rate of alien plant establishment due to the stronger
   effects of residence time and propagule pressure. The magnitude of any
   direct climate effect on the number of new alien species will be small
   relative to human-assisted introductions driven by socioeconomic
   factors. Casual alien species (sleepers) whose population persistence is
   limited by climate are expected to exhibit greater rates of
   establishment under climate change assuming that propagule pressure
   remains at least at current levels. Surveillance and management
   targeting sleeper pests and diseases may be the most cost-effective
   option to reduce future impacts under climate change. Most established
   alien species will increase their distribution range in Great Britain
   over the next century. However, such range increases are very likely be
   the result of natural expansion of populations that have yet to reach
   equilibrium with their environment, rather than a direct consequence of
   climate change. To assess the potential realised range of alien species
   will require a spatially explicit approach that not only integrates
   bioclimatic suitability and population-level demographic rates but also
   simulation of landscape-level processes (e.g. dispersal, land-use
   change, host/habitat distribution, non-climatic edaphic constraints). In
   terms of invasive alien species that have known economic or biodiversity
   impacts, the taxa that are likely to be the most responsive are plant
   pathogens and insect pests of agricultural crops. However, the extent to
   which climate adaptation strategies lead to new crops, altered
   rotations, and different farming practices (e.g. irrigation,
   fertilization) will all shape the potential agricultural impacts of
   alien species. The greatest uncertainty in the effects of climate change
   on biological invasions exists with identifying the future character of
   new species introductions and predicting ecosystem impacts. Two
   complementary strategies may work under these conditions of high
   uncertainty: (i) prioritise ecosystems in terms of their perceived
   vulnerability to climate change and prevent ingress or expansion of
   alien species therein that may exacerbate problems; (ii) target those
   ecosystem already threatened by alien species and implement management
   to prevent the situation deteriorating under climate change.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The occurrence frequency of drought has intensified with the
   unprecedented effect of global warming. Knowledge about the
   spatiotemporal distributions of droughts and their trends is crucial for
   risk management and developing mitigation strategies. In this study, we
   developed seven artificial neural network (ANN) predictive models
   incorporating hydro-meteorological, climate, sea surface temperatures,
   and topographic attributes to forecast the standardized precipitation
   evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for seven stations in the Upper Blue
   Nile basin (UBN) of Ethiopia from 1986 to 2015. The main aim was to
   analyze the sensitivity of drought-trigger input parameters and to
   measure their predictive ability by comparing the predicted values with
   the observed values. Statistical comparisons of the different models
   showed that accurate results in predicting SPEI values could be achieved
   by including large-scale climate indices. Furthermore, it was found that
   the coefficient of determination and the root-mean-square error of the
   best architecture ranged from 0.820 to 0.949 and 0.263 to 0.428,
   respectively. In terms of statistical achievement, we concluded that
   ANNs offer an alternative framework for forecasting the SPEI drought
   index.},

Abstract = {Artificial urban surfaces are commonly considered as main direct cause
   of Urban Heat Island effects. Most urban land covers are dark and
   impermeable and accelerating excessive heat absorption and storage. The
   paper characterizes cool surface strategies in criteria of definition,
   classification and application approach, as well as proposes of a
   framework to guide applications associate with grey, blue and green
   infrastructure on urban heat island mitigation. As a case study,
   analysis of surface strategy and its cooling performance was performed
   at Technical University of Kosice campus. On perspective of economic and
   ecological feasibility, two proposals were simulated. The results show
   that both measures have significant impact on surface cooling, although
   the maximum and average temperature reductions vary between measures. In
   addition, overall value of each proposal is provided as reference for
   decision makers to meet their best interests. All these findings can
   support climate change adaptation strategy in Kosice, should be also
   applicable for similar projects and proposals in other regions.},

Title = {Non-linear interactions between sea-level rise, tides, and geomorphic
   change in the Tamar Estuary, Australia},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {225},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Forecasting the likely impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) within estuaries
   is especially complicated by the interacting effects of geomorphic
   change and tidal distortion. The 70 km long kanamaluka(1)/Tamar Estuary,
   Australia, provides the setting for a simplified approach to explore the
   effects of SLR on tidal regime together with evolving estuary
   morphology. Scenarios of SLR, estuary infill, nodal tide modulation at
   the mouth, and increased wind speed are applied within a hydrodynamic
   model. The potential for amplified tidal range with SLR versus the
   damping potential of significant but plausible levels of estuary infill
   are explored. For this estuary, the simulated infilling had a strong
   effect on tidal distortion, up to a 57\% reduction in tidal range at the
   estuary head. However, this reduction translates to just a 16\%
   effective reduction in mean high water due to the elevation of mean tide
   level. Comparatively, SLR had a contrasting effect on tidal distortion,
   reducing flood tide dominant asymmetry by up to 40\% without driving a
   significant change to the tidal range. The same 57\% reduction in tidal
   range at the estuary head would limit projected SLR by 2100 to current
   (2018) levels, suggesting potential for mitigating SLR with engineered
   solutions. The efficient and effective design of mitigation strategies
   depends on the improved availability and quality of observational data.
   Data-driven modelling approaches will be essential for managing future
   coastal flood risk with SLR and ensure long term resilience.},

Number = {7, SI},

Abstract = {Smallholder farmers are key actors in addressing the food and nutrition
   insecurity challenges facing the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), while
   also minimizing the ecological footprint of food production systems.
   However, fostering innovation in the region's smallholder farming
   systems will require more decentralized, adaptive, and heterogeneous
   institutional structures and approaches than presently exist. In this
   paper, we review the conditions that have been undermining sustainable
   food and nutrition security in the Caribbean, focusing on issues of
   history, economy, and innovation. Building on this discussion, we then
   argue for a different approach to agricultural development in the Small
   Island Developing States of the CARICOM that draws primarily on
   socioecological resilience and agricultural innovation systems
   frameworks. Research needs are subsequently identified, including the
   need to better understand how social capital can facilitate adaptive
   capacity in diverse smallholder farming contexts; how formal and
   informal institutions interact in domestic agriculture and food systems
   to affect collaboration, co-learning, and collective action; how social
   actors might better play bridging and linking roles that can support
   mutual learning, collaboration, and reciprocal knowledge flows; and the
   reasons underlying past innovation failures and successes to facilitate
   organizational learning.},

Title = {Conserving intertidal habitats: What is the potential of ecological
   engineering to mitigate impacts of coastal structures?},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {167},
Number = {B},
Pages = {504-515},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Globally, coastlines are under pressure as coastal human population
   growth and urbanization continues, while climatic change leads to
   stormier seas and rising tides. These trends create a strong and
   sustained demand for land reclamation and infrastructure protection in
   coastal areas, requiring engineered coastal defence structures such as
   sea walls. Here, we review the nature of ecological impacts of coastal
   structures on intertidal ecosystems, seek to understand the extent to
   which ecological engineering can mitigate these impacts, and evaluate
   the effectiveness of mitigation as a tool to contribute to conservation
   of intertidal habitats. By so doing, we identify critical knowledge gaps
   to inform future research. Coastal structures alter important physical,
   chemical and biological processes of intertidal habitats, and strongly
   impact community structure, inter-habitat linkages and ecosystem
   services while also driving habitat loss. Such impacts occur diffusely
   across localised sites but scale to significant regional and global
   levels. Recent advances in ecological engineering have focused on
   developing habitat complexity on coastal structures to increase
   biodiversity. `Soft' engineering options maximise habitat complexity
   through inclusion of natural materials, species and processes, while
   simultaneously delivering engineering objectives such as coastal
   protection. Soft options additionally sustain multiple services,
   providing greater economic benefits for society, and resilience to
   climatic change. Currently however, a lack of inclusion and economic
   undervaluation of intertidal ecosystem services may undermine best
   practice in coastline management. Importantly, reviewed evidence shows
   mitigation and even restoration do not support intertidal communities or
   processes equivalent to pre-disturbance conditions. Crucially, an
   absence of comprehensive empirical baseline biodiversity data, or data
   comprising additional ecological parameters such as ecosystem functions
   and services, prohibits quantification of absolute and relative
   magnitudes of ecological impacts due to coastal structures or
   effectiveness of mitigation interventions. This knowledge deficit
   restricts evaluation of the potential of ecological engineering to
   contribute to conservation policies for intertidal habitats. To improve
   mitigation design and effectiveness, a greater focus on in-situ research
   is needed, requiring stronger and timely collaboration between
   government agencies, construction partners and research scientists. (c)

Title = {The impacts of long-term changes in weather on small-scale fishers'
   available fishing hours in Nosy Barren, Madagascar},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are highly susceptible to changes in weather
   patterns. For example, in Nosy Barren, Madagascar, SSF use traditional
   pirogues with handcrafted sails that rely on seasonal wind and sea
   conditions. As climate change is expected to increase the intensity and
   frequency of severe weather, it is important to understand how changes
   in weather affect SSF fishing efforts. Yet, a gap exists in the
   understanding of how changes in meteorological conditions affect small
   scale fishers. This study combines fishers' meteorological knowledge of
   weather conditions that allow for small-scale fishing with long-term
   remotely sensed meteorological data to quantify how fishing effort,
   defined as available fishing hours, of SSF in coastal Madagascar has
   changed between 1979-2020 in response to long-term weather trends.
   Results show a significant decrease in available fishing hours over the
   examined time period. Particularly, we found that a decrease in
   available fishing hours between 1979-2020 with a loss of 21.7 available
   fishing hours per year. Increased adverse weather conditions, likely
   associated with climate change, could decrease fishers access to crucial
   resources needed for the food and livelihood security. Climate change
   adaptation strategies will need to account for changing weather impacts
   on fishing availability.},

Title = {Alleviating impacts of climate change on fishing communities using
   weather information to improve fishers' resilience},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {This study contributes new knowledge in evaluating actions aimed at
   alleviating impacts of climate change on small-scale fishers and
   enhancing resilience in their households in West Africa. Evidence of the
   damage caused by climate change to the artisanal fisheries sector in
   West African countries is accumulating. Current measures in place for
   artisanal fishers to adapt to these changes include broad long-term
   pro-poor strategies designed to manage the persistent problem of
   overfishing and declining fish stocks. However, one immediate coping
   strategy is beginning to emerge, the more active use of reliable weather
   information. Based on 80 semi-structured interviews conducted in
   Senegal, Ghana, and Nigeria between 2021 and 2022, this study
   investigates claims that the use of weather information (WI) is helping
   West African artisanal fishers and those involved in secondary fishery
   activities to build more climate-resilient household income and food
   security. Unlike the long-term measures for mitigating the impact of
   climate change, results from the study show that by assessing the risk,
   their marine capture activities using weather information, fishers are
   immediately benefitting. Using the diffusion of the innovation theory to
   investigate the pattern of fishers' adoption and usage of weather
   information, we found that Senegalese marine artisanal fishers can be
   classified as ``Early Adopters `` of this innovation. However, this is
   not the case with inland fishers who remain skeptical and will only use
   weather information if they can ascertain its reliability. West Africa's
   inland fisheries sector is often neglected in climate change strategies:
   there is a lack of coordinated action to understand the weather
   information needs of these vulnerable fishers in order to coassess and
   codevelop bespoke weather products that offer benefits to them. However,
   West Africa's fisheries, especially those inland, are too important to
   ignore if the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs),
   including no poverty and zero hunger, are to be achieved. To help this
   sector fully benefit from the use of weather information, this study
   recommends detailed research into the weather information needs of these
   fishers and user-friendly ways to engage with the fishers to transmit
   the information.},

Title = {Soil salinity assessment and coping strategies in the coastal
   agricultural landscape in Djilor district, Senegal},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {88},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil salinity remains one of the most severe environmental problems in
   the coastal agricultural areas in Senegal. It reduces crop yields
   thereby endangering smallholder farmers' livelihood. This paper aims to
   investigate soil salinity pattern and relationship with some
   environmental factors based on 304 soil sample plots (at 0-30 cm depth)
   coupled with farm household survey in Djilor district, Fatick Region.
   Elevation, slope, groundwater depth, and normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) values of each sample plots were extracted using
   the ArcGIS. Through statistical analyses, the results showed that bare
   land, land under fallow, rice plots and Fluvisols (soil type) registered
   high content of salt. Clay content, soil pH, elevation, distance to
   river and Fluvisols were significant factors associated with the
   increased salt content. Contrary to expectations, soil salinity had no
   relationship with groundwater depth in the study area. Ninety-six
   percent of the respondents were affected by salinization. Women group
   engaged in rice farming appeared to be more affected by soil salinity.
   To cope with the negative impact of soil salinity in the study area, the
   farmers' strategies are the application of chemical fertilizer and
   manure, planting and conservation of trees, and installation of soil
   bunds. Smallholder farmers also expressed their need for support on
   adaptation and mitigation from the government or any concerned
   organizations involved in this environmental issue. This study provides
   a baseline in soil salinity assessment and helps decision makers
   regarding land management and salt-affected areas restoration.},

Title = {Efficiency of Aerial Drones for Macrolitter Monitoring on Baltic Sea
   Beaches},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Marine litter is a global problem that requires soon management and
   design of mitigation strategies. Marine litter monitoring is an
   essential step to assess the abundances, distributions, sinks and
   hotspots of pollution as well as the effectiveness of mitigation
   measures. However, these need to be time and cost-efficient, fit for
   purpose and context, as well as provide a standardized methodology
   suitable for comparison among surveys. In Europe, the Marine Strategy
   Framework Directive (MSFD) provides a structure for the effective
   implementation of long-term monitoring. For beaches, the
   well-established 100 m OSPAR macrolitter monitoring exists. However,
   this method requires a high staff effort and suffers from a high
   spatio-temporal variability of the results. In this study, we test the
   potential of aerial drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) together
   with a Geographic Information System approach for semi-automatic
   classification of meso- (1-25 mm) and macrolitter (>25 mm) at four
   beaches of the southern Baltic Sea. Visual screening of drone images in
   recovery experiments (50 m(2) areas) at 10 m height revealed an accuracy
   of 99\%. The total accuracy of classification using object-based
   classification was 45-90\% for the classification with four classes and
   50-66\% for the classification with six classes, depending on the
   algorithm and flight height used. On 100 m beach monitoring transects
   the accuracy was between 39-74\% (4 classes) and 25-74\% (6 classes),
   with very low kappa values, indicating that the GIS classification
   method cannot be regarded as a reliable method for the detection of
   litter in the Southern Baltic. In terms of cost-efficiency, the drone
   method showed high reproducibility and moderate accuracy, with much
   lower flexibility and quality of data than a comparable spatial-OSPAR
   method. Consequently, our results suggest that drone based monitoring
   cannot be recommended as a replacement or complement existing methods in
   southern Baltic beaches. However, drone monitoring could be useful at
   other sites and other methods for image analysis should be tested to
   explore this tool for fast-screening of non-accessible sites, fragile
   ecosystems, floating litter or heavily polluted beaches.},

Title = {Effects of climate change and management policies on marine fisheries
   productivity in the north-east coast of India},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {724},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The study covers two important deltaic systems of the north-east coast
   of India, viz. the Bengal and Mahanadi delta that support about 1.25
   million people. The changes in potential marine fish production and
   socioeconomic conditions were modelled for these two deltas under
   long-term changes in environmental conditions (sea surface temperature
   and primary production) to the end of the 21st century. Our results show
   that an increased temperature (by 4 degrees C) has a negative impact on
   fisheries productivity, which was projected to decrease by 5\%. At the
   species level, Bombay duck, Indian mackerel and threadfin bream showed
   an increasing trend in the biomass of potential catches under the
   sustainable fishing scenario. However, under the business as usual and
   overfishing scenarios, our results suggest reduced catch for both
   states. On the other hand, mackerel tuna, Indian oil sardine, and hilsa
   fisheries showed a projected reduction in potential catch also for the
   sustainable fishing scenario. The socio-economic models projected an
   increase of up to 0.67\% (involving 0.8 billion USD) in consumption by
   2050 even under the best management scenario. The GDP per capita was
   projected to face a loss of 1.7 billion USD by 2050. The loss of
   low-cost fisheries would negatively impact the poorer coastal population
   since they strongly depend upon these fisheries as a source of protein.
   Nevertheless, adaptation strategies tend to have a negative correlation
   with poverty and food insecurity which needs to be addressed separately
   to make the sector-specific efforts effective. This work can be
   considered as the baseline model for future researchers and the
   policymakers to explore potential sustainable management options for the
   studied regions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to describe an in-depth study that aimed to
   assess and develop a strategic disaster risk reduction plan to integrate
   climate change adaptation countermeasures in Cilincing, a North Jakarta
   City sub-district. Design/methodology/approach The study used a
   back-casting approach to cover hazard assessment induced by increased
   susceptibility, as well as vulnerability, both as a baseline study and
   projected up to 2045 at the micro level. The urban village (Kelurahan)
   level is the unit of analysis. The capacity analysis is used as baseline
   data, which is reviewed against the trend of the hazard and
   vulnerability. Findings The results of the study identify short-,
   medium- and long-term recommendations to integrate disaster risk
   reduction and climate change adaption. These include capacity building,
   especially emergency response capabilities, an increase of drainage
   capacity, improvements to transboundary management and minimising
   driving forces. Originality/value This is a unique, micro-scale case
   study in the Cilincing sub-district of Jakarta that assesses and
   develops strategic disaster risk countermeasures and a reduction plan
   that integrates the effects of climate change, thereby addressing future
   disaster risk in Jakarta.},

Title = {A methodological approach to characterize the resilience of aquatic
   ecosystems with application to Lake Annecy, France},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {{[} 1] We propose a methodological approach to characterize the
   resilience of aquatic ecosystems with respect to the evolution of
   environmental parameters as well as their aptitude to adapt to forcings.
   This method that is applied to Lake Annecy, France, proceeds in three
   stages. First, according to the depth, variations of physicochemical
   parameters versus time are separated into three components related to (
   1) energy transfer through the surface of the lake, ( 2) the flow of
   rivers and springs that feed the lake, and ( 3) long-term evolution of
   the benthic zone as a consequence of mineral and organic matter loads.
   Second, dynamics of the lake are deduced by analyzing the
   physicochemical parameter components related to the three boundary
   conditions. Third, a stochastic process associated with the transfer
   models aims to characterize the resilience of the lakes according to
   forcings. For Lake Annecy, whose dynamics are representative of
   oligotrophic stratified lakes controlled by decarbonation processes
   where turnover and mixing occurring once a year in winter, the major
   consequence is the impoverishment of dissolved oxygen in deep water in
   autumn due to a temperature increase of the surface water in summer. The
   simulation raises relevant questions about whether a connection exists
   between physicochemical parameters and global warming, which should not
   induce harmful consequences on water quality and biodiversity in deep
   water. This methodological approach is general since it does not use any
   physical conceptual model to predict the hydrosystem behavior but uses
   directly observed data.},

Title = {Where does climate fit? Vulnerability to climate change in the context
   of multiple stressors in Funafuti, Tuvalu},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {43-55},

Abstract = {This paper examines vulnerability to climate change in the context of
   multiple stressors through a case study of Funafuti, Tuvalu. Climate
   change research in Pacific Islands has largely focused on biophysical
   changes such as sea-level rise. Less is known about how livelihoods are
   affected and what adaptation options are realistic. The research employs
   a vulnerability framework to identify where climate fits in the suite of
   forces (socioeconomic, cultural, environmental) already affecting
   livelihoods. The participatory approach includes semi-structured
   interviews with community members, initially without reference to
   climate. Key areas of concern to people in Funafuti are economic, food,
   water and overcrowding, rather than climate change. Vulnerability to
   changing climatic conditions is evident in water, land, and food through
   the interaction of non-climatic forces (e.g. overcrowding, urbanization,
   few economic opportunities, changing land use, and shifting cultural
   norms), and climatic forces (e.g. dry spells, extreme sea-levels, strong
   winds and changing marine conditions). Adaptations, beyond bearing the
   effects and sharing the burden, are mainly reactive and short-term.
   Future changes in climate will be experienced in the context of these
   multiple, interacting forces, and adaptation initiatives will need to be
   designed in light of these. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {UNDERSTANDING AND REDUCING CLIMATE RISKS: THE IMPACT OF INNOVATIVE
   POLICIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DROUGHT RESPONSE IN CABO VERDE},
Journal = {ESTUDIOS GEOGRAFICOS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {81},
Number = {288},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {The Sahel has experienced severe drought conditions since the 1970s,
   whereas in West Africa extreme droughts have occurred more frequently in
   recent years. Drought is the most relevant hazard in Cabo Verde in terms
   of economic losses. This archipelagic country experiences extreme
   drought conditions regularly with particular impact on the agricultural
   sector. Although climate variability is a significant source of risk,
   the impact of drought on agriculture and society does not only depend on
   the inherent hydrometeorological characteristics of a region, but also
   the levels of exposure and the vulnerability of people, political, and
   agricultural systems. In this regard, and in light of global changes,
   the understanding of emerging political perspectives to deal with
   climate-related risks is essential to benefit planning and
   decision-making processes. In this qualitative descriptive research, we
   seek to provide policymakers and civil society with an up-to-date
   outline of crucial developments and factors that links disaster
   reduction and climate change adaptation mainstreaming into development.
   The study considers Cabo Verde, with particular emphasis on the 2017-18
   drought emergency response. It seeks to discuss the observed impacts of
   climate change on territorial development, as it provides the basis for
   understanding innovative approaches for drought risk and supporting
   activities towards drought risk reduction, aimed at increasing the
   Disaster Risk Reduction knowledge base by capturing issues that have
   emerged from national efforts making sure they inform international
   processes in order to enable climate-resilient pathways.},

Title = {Securing Indigenous politics: A critique of the vulnerability and

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-114},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Over the past decade research examining the human dimensions of climatic
   change in the Arctic has expanded significantly and has become the
   dominant framework through which the relations between northern peoples
   and climatic change are understood by scholars, policy makers, political
   leaders, and the media. This paper critically examines the assumptions,
   exclusions, and orientations that characterize this broad literature,
   and suggests revising and expanding the terms upon which it is carried
   out. It focuses in particular on the exclusion of colonialism from the
   study of human vulnerability and adaptation to climatic change, the
   framing of Indigenous peoples and communities in terms of the local and
   the traditional, and the ways in which efforts to improve the lives of
   northern Indigenous peoples risk perpetuating colonial relations. The
   paper argues that these exclusions and orientations lead scholars to
   systematically overlook the immense importance of resource extraction
   and shipping as human dimensions of climatic change in the Canadian
   Arctic, and it examines the implications of such oversights. (C) 2011

Title = {Climate-change threats to distribution, habitats, sustainability and
   conservation of highly traded medicinal and aromatic plants in Nepal},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change poses significant challenges to the conservation of
   highly traded prioritized medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) from the
   Greater Himalayas. It is therefore essential to understand, `how' and
   `where' the plantation of MAPs can be effectively implemented for
   dealing with conservation-related issues. However, the ensemble species
   distribution modelling (eSDM) approach could be best to determine the
   climatic space of six highly traded MAPs for plantation in Nepal.
   Meanwhile, the current suitability was projected to the future (2070;
   RCP 4.5) scenario using a global circulation model (GCM), BCC-CSM1.1.
   The model delineated climatic space of six highly traded MAPs in the
   highlands altitudinally ranging from 1800 to 4200 m a.s.l. (meter above
   sea level) with the core hotspot in the central region of Nepal. Under
   the current and future scenarios, Nardostachys jatamansi `Spikenard' and
   Aconitum spicatum `Aconite' are projected to have the highest (ca. 15\%
   and 17\%) and lowest (ca. 3\% and 9\%) suitable areas respectively. The
   climatic zone in the hilly region (ca. 3000 m) can be suitable for mixed
   cultivation of all six MAPs in combination with Paris polyphylla `Love
   Apple' whereas, middle mountainous region (ca. 4000 m) is more suitable
   for Nardostachys jatamansi. Therefore, the appropriate climatic space of
   the highly traded MAPs suggests the great possibility of their mixed
   cultivation to combat the increasing pressure from international trade,
   thereby benefiting the local farmers or collectors. This approach is
   crucial for conceiving the adaptive measures for sustainable management
   concerning the conservation of the highly traded MAPs.},

Title = {Adaptive capacity of co-management systems in the face of environmental
   change: The soft-shell clam fishery and invasive green crabs in Maine},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {26-32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Co-management, or regulatory decision-making through collaboration among
   user-groups, government officials, and scientists, has been proposed as
   an effective marine management tool in the face of environmental change.
   One potential advantage attributed to co-management is that such systems
   may have greater adaptive capacity than more conventional top-down
   management regimes. However, it is difficult to empirically test the
   relative adaptability of co-managed systems in the real world. This
   research uses a case study of the soft-shell clam fishery in Maine to
   investigate the question: Are co-managed systems better able to adapt to
   environmental change than are conventionally managed systems? This
   fishery provides an ideal system with which to address this question
   because (1) it is differentially managed, with some municipalities
   engaging in co-management and some in state management and (2) it faces
   an imminent environmental threat in the form of invasive predatory green
   crabs. This research first explores the scope of the green crab invasion
   in Maine, showing that although there have been no detectible impacts of
   green crabs on clam harvests to date, geographic overlaps of highly
   productive clam fisheries and high crab densities suggest a high
   likelihood of future impact. Second, to assess relative adaptability to
   this threat, this study quantifies differences between state- and
   co-managed systems across three attributes: user group stability,
   resource productivity, and institutional capacity to respond to change.
   It finds that co-managed clam fisheries have a higher degree of
   stability (i.e., a well defined user group), higher and more consistent
   productivity (i.e., more resources and incentives for sustained
   management), and greater institutional capacity to respond to change in
   the form of ``conservation hours,{''} a flexible management tool
   employed in co-managed fisheries. These results indicate that co-managed
   clam fisheries are better prepared to adapt to environmental change than
   are conventionally managed fisheries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Effects of sea ice on Arctic biota: an emerging crisis discipline},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The rapid decline in Arctic sea ice (ASI) extent, area and volume during
   recent decades is occurring before we can understand many of the
   mechanisms through which ASI interacts with biological processes both at
   sea and on land. As a consequence, our ability to predict and manage the
   effects of this enormous environmental change is limited, making this a
   crisis discipline. Here, we propose a framework to study these effects,
   defining direct effects as those acting on life-history events of Arctic
   biota, and indirect effects, where ASI acts upon biological systems
   through chains of events, normally involving other components of the
   physical system and/or biotic interactions. Given the breadth and
   complexity of ASI's effects on Arctic biota, Arctic research requires a
   truly multidisciplinary approach to address this issue. In the absence
   of effective global efforts to tackle anthropogenic global warming, ASI
   will likely continue to decrease, compromising the conservation of many
   ASI-related taxonomic groups and ecosystems. Mitigation actions will
   rely heavily on the knowledge acquired on the mechanisms and components
   involved with the biological effects of ASI.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses some of the elements that may characterise an
   efficient strategy to adapt to a changing climate. Such a strategy will
   have to reflect the long time horizon of, and the prevailing
   uncertainties about, climate change. An intuitively appealing approach
   therefore seems to be to enhance the flexibility and resilience of
   systems to react to and cope with climate shocks and extremes, as well
   as to improve information. In addition, in the case of
   quasi-irreversible investments with a long lifetime (e.g. infrastructure
   investments, development of coastal zones) precautionary adjustments may
   be called for to increase the robustness of structures, or to increase
   the rate of depreciation to allow for earlier replacement. Many of these
   measures may already have to be considered now, and could be worthwhile
   in their own right, independent of climate change considerations. (C)

Title = {Multidecadal Shoreline Changes in Denmark},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {714-728},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Multidecadal shoreline changes along ca. 7000 km coastline around
   Denmark were computed for the time interval between 1862 AD and 2005 AD
   and were connected with a geomorphological coastal classification. The
   shoreline data set was based on shoreline positions from historical and
   modern topographic maps. Coastal landforms were identified on a digital
   terrain model in combination with aerial photographs. Two
   shoreline-change computation methods were evaluated at a test site,
   aiming for optimized time efficiency and accuracy of the countrywide
   application: a Nearest Neighbor search and a cross-shore transect method
   based on the ArcGIS-based Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The
   cross-shore transect method was more robust and performed better in the
   detection of local extremes in shoreline changes, which was crucial for
   the scope of the mapping. Countrywide shoreline-change distances and
   rates were, therefore, computed with the DSAS method. Patterns in
   coastline dynamics were identified through the connection of
   shoreline-change rates with the occurrence of coastal landforms.
   Short-term changes and alterations of shoreline evolution through
   coastal structures were not resolved in this study. Because of the long
   time span covered, the relative errors originating from data and method
   are acceptable. The scope of the mapping was to provide a coastal
   management tool that allows screening for critical sites with respect to
   coastal erosion. As the first countrywide quantification of historical
   shoreline changes around Denmark, the mapping can contribute to enhanced
   adaptation and mitigation strategies in response to increased risks of
   erosion and flooding under a changing climate.},

Title = {Modeling of local sea level rise and its future projection under climate

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {134},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sea level rise is one of the manifestations of climate change and may
   cause a threat to the coastal regions. Estimates from global circulation
   models (GCMs) are either not available on coastal locations due to their
   coarse spatial resolution or not reliable since the mismatch between
   (interpolated) GCM estimates at coastal locations and actual observation
   over historical period is significantly different. We propose a
   semi-empirical framework to model the local sea level rise (SLR) using
   the possibly existing relationship between local SLR and regional
   atmospheric/oceanic variables. Selection of set of input variables
   mostly based on the literature bears the signature of both atmospheric
   and oceanic variables that possibly have an effect on SLR. The proposed
   approach offers a method to extract the combined information hidden in
   the regional fields of atmospheric/oceanic variables for a specific
   target coastal location. Generality of the approach ensures the
   inclusion of more variables in the set of inputs depending on the
   geographical location of any coastal station. For demonstration, 14
   coastal locations along the Indian coast and islands are considered and
   a set of regional atmospheric and oceanic variables are considered.
   After development and validation of the model at each coastal location
   with the historical data, the model is further used for future
   projection of local SLR up to the year 2100 for three different future
   emission scenarios represented by representative concentration pathways
   (RCPs)RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The maximum projected SLR is found to
   vary from 260.65 to 393.16mm (RCP8.5) by the end of 2100 among the
   locations considered. Outcome of the proposed approach is expected to be
   useful in regional coastal management and in developing mitigation
   strategies in a changing climate.},

Abstract = {The goals of ecosystem-based management (EBM) include protecting
   ecological resilience, the magnitude of a perturbation that a community
   can withstand and remain in a given state. As a tool to achieve this
   goal, no-take marine reserves may enhance resilience by protecting
   source populations or reduce it by concentrating fishing in harvested
   areas. Here, we test whether spatial management with marine reserves can
   increase ecological resilience compared to non-spatial (conventional)
   management using a dynamic model of a simplified fish community with
   structured predation and competition that causes alternative stable
   states. Relative to non-spatial management, reserves increase the
   resilience of the desired (predator-dominated) equilibrium state in both
   stochastic and deterministic environments, especially under intensive
   fishing. As a result, spatial management also increases the feasibility
   of restoring degraded (competitor-dominated) systems, particularly if
   combined with culling of competitors or stock enhancement of adult
   predators.},

Abstract = {We develop a Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SeVI) for climate change
   affected communities in seven unions l of Koyra upazilla2 in
   south-western coastal Bangladesh. We survey GO households from each
   union to collect data on various vulnerability domains and socioeconomic
   indicators. The SeVI aggregate these collected data using a composite
   indicator index, where a relative weight is assigned to each indicator
   with a view of obtaining weighted average index scores for different
   vulnerability domains in different unions. Results suggest that southern
   and south-eastern unions are relatively more vulnerable, which are the
   most exposed to natural hazards and mostly surrounded by the mangrove
   forest Sundarbans. Furthermore, social, economic and disaster frequency
   are found as more influential indicators to adaptive capacity,
   sensitivity and exposure respectively in Koyru. This pragmatic approach
   is useful to figure out and monitor socioeconomic vulnerability and/or
   assess potential adaptation-policy effectiveness in data scarce regions
   by incorporating scenarios into the SeVI for baseline comparison. (C)

Abstract = {Urbanization, land subsidence and sea level rise will increase
   vulnerability to droughts in the urbanized low-lying areas in the
   western part of the Netherlands. In this paper a possibility is explored
   to. decrease vulnerability of urban areas by implementing an alternative
   water supply option. A four component vulnerability framework is
   presented that includes threshold capacity, coping capacity, recovery
   capacity and adaptive capacity. By using the vulnerability framework it
   is elaborated that current water supply strategies in the Netherlands
   mainly focus on increasing threshold capacity by constructing improved
   water storage and delivery infrastructure. A complete vulnerability
   decreasing strategy requires measures that include all four components.
   Adaptive capacity can be developed by starting experiments with new
   modes of water supply. A concept which is symbolically called `the
   closed city' uses local urban rainfall as the only source of water
   supply. The `closed city' can decrease the water dependence of urban
   areas on (1) the surrounding rural areas that are diminishing in size
   and that are increasingly under strain and (2) river water resources
   that will probably be less constant and reliable as a result of climate
   change.},

Title = {Adaptation and the physiology of ocean acidification},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {980-990},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of atmospheric CO2, is a
   threat to marine bio-diversity, potentially rivalling the threat imposed
   by rising temperatures in some marine ecosystems. Although a growing
   body of literature documents negative effects of acidification on marine
   organisms, the majority of this work has focused on the effects of
   future conditions on modern populations, ignoring the potential effects
   of adaptation and physiological acclimatization.
   2. We review current literature on the potential for adaptation to
   elevated pCO(2) in marine organisms. Although this body of work is
   currently quite small, we argue that data on the physiological effects
   of acidification, natural variation in pH and lessons learned from
   previous work on thermal adaptation can all inform predictions and
   priorities for future research.
   3. Spatially varying selection is one of the most important forces
   maintaining intraspecific genetic variation. Unlike temperature, pH
   lacks a strong and persistent global gradient, and so selection may
   maintain less adaptive variation for pH than for temperature. On the
   other hand, we are only beginning to amass long-term data sets for pH
   variation in natural habitats, and thus, pH gradients may be more common
   than previously observed.
   4. Two of the most important effects of elevated pCO(2) are reduced
   calcification and changes in metabolism. We discuss the ways that a
   detailed understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying these
   effects is key to predicting the capacity for acclimatization and
   adaptation.
   5. Important priorities for future research will be to assess local
   adaptation to pH conditions and to measure the capacity for adaptation
   to future acidified conditions in natural populations. Tools for this
   work include traditional quantitative genetics, transcriptomics and the
   adaptation of ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) technology
   for use in continuous sea-water pH monitoring in the field.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {161},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {89-108},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Pacific Islands often exemplify climate change vulnerability, yet little
   scholarship has probed how these representations translate to the media.
   This study examines newspaper articles about Pacific Islands and climate
   change in American, British, and Australian newspapers from 1999 to
   2018, analyzing volume, content, and dominant narratives. These
   quantitative results are complemented by semi-structured interviews with
   journalists as well as Pacific stakeholders who engage with the media.
   Reporting on Pacific Islands and climate change focuses heavily on who
   and what are at risk from climate impacts; reporting on solutions is
   less frequent and dominated by discussions of migration. This
   overemphasis on vulnerability potentially downplays the importance of
   the resiliency and action of Pacific Island communities and positions
   the Pacific as a site for climate catastrophe, rather than climate
   justice. However, recent reporting may be moving away from overarching
   narratives of vulnerability, motivating continued research into these
   depictions and how they promote or discourage climate action.},

Title = {Revising the limits of the coastal area in the regulations of the
   iberoamerican region. Are they appropriate for risk management and
   adaptation to climate change?},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Coastal laws define the boundaries of the coastal zone. Both a
   terrestrial part and a marine part are usually included, which can be
   anything from ten to two hundred or more meters. They are usually
   declared public domain zones, and a protection zone, parallel to the
   coastal edge, is often determined. The function of the protection zone
   is to reduce pressures of anthropogenic origin on coastal ecosystems,
   its services and, simultaneously, mitigate extreme natural phenomena
   within the inhabited areas of the coast. Protection zones are
   established according to different types of criteria. In this study,
   they have been classified into two main groups: scientific/universal
   criteria and functional/operational criteria.
   Integrated coastal zone management addresses complex problems for the
   organization of economic uses and activities, based on the protection of
   ecosystems, while addressing coastal risks. At present, erosion is one
   of the most serious issues affecting the coast, a problem that is likely
   to intensify as a result of sea level rise, which is an effect of
   climate change. The objective of this paper is to analyze regulations
   affecting the coast in the Ibero-American Region, paying special
   attention to the definition of the geographical area. Results of this
   study are: most laws, especially in the terrestrial area, use arbitrary
   criteria and metric distances. In the marine environment, the limit of
   the coastal zone is usually fixed up to 12 nautical miles from the
   Territorial Sea. On few occasions, natural-physical criteria are used,
   which take into account the characteristics of the coast and anthropic
   criteria, such as the socio-economic reality. This means that limits
   have been established that are politically functional, as well as
   practices that do not take into account the vulnerability of the area,
   the functioning of coastal ecosystems or protection against natural
   risks. We are in no doubt that, faced with the challenge of establishing
   adaptation measures for the effects of climate change, the search for a
   new delimitation of the coastal zone should be considered an urgent
   matter.},

Title = {Re-naturing cities: reducing flood risk through nature based solutions},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Number = {2},
Pages = {105-109},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Climate change is already reshaping the environments within which we
   live. From regional impacts, such as increased frequency, severity and
   duration of extreme weather events in the form of wildfires and
   hurricanes, to localised events in the form of riverine flooding and
   coastal storm surges, different disciplinary professionals all recognise
   that adaptation to a warming planet needs urgent attention and action.
   This article examines how emerging scholarship around `re-naturing
   cities' could support societal transformation in the face of uncertain
   futures. The first section discusses the concept of `flood risk
   management' (FRM) from its emergence from (and beyond) flood prevention
   strategy principles, and examines the reasons why FRM's current approach
   only goes so far in supporting adaptation strategies. The second section
   explores the rationale behind re-naturing cities, particularly in light
   of global urbanisation, to interrogate how using green infrastructure
   (GI) and nature-based solutions (NBS) can enrich the FRM discourse's
   `toolbox' to help reduce flood risk - both for city dwellers and those
   living and working in periurban and hinterland environments. Using case
   studies of strategies for re-naturing cities around the world that
   directly address flood risk, including arboreal avenues, pocket parks,
   Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and reconstructed urban
   wetlands, the article concludes with a brief reflection on how feasible,
   equitable and sustainable the re-naturing cities approach might be for
   our current and future global citizens.},

Title = {On the risks of engineering mobility to reduce vulnerability to climate
   change: insights from a small island state},
Booktitle = {CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN MOBILITY: GLOBAL CHALLENGES TO THE SOCIAL
   SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {169-189},
Abstract = {This chapter explains the likely consequences of proposals to resettle
   large numbers of people away from the Pacific Islands for the people
   left behind. It does this by describing the effects of large-scale
   migration away from the small island state of Niue, which is a very good
   analogue from which lessons for other islands can be drawn.
   The chapter begins by examining the discourse on large-scale migration
   as a solution to save the people of the Pacific Islands from the impacts
   of climate change. The discourse of draining the people from these
   remote island backwaters of the world persists even though understanding
   of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in the Pacific Islands
   remains extremely limited. In this discourse there is little concern for
   the needs and rights of migrants, and no consideration of the
   consequences of such movements for those people who cannot or do not
   wish to move. It is this latter issue that this chapter examines.
   There has been large-scale migration from Niue since 1971, to the extent
   that 80 per cent of the people born in Niue now live in New Zealand.
   There are six principal effects of this depopulation on those who remain
   on the island, namely that it leads to: distortions in markets;
   obsolescent political and administrative institutions; a
   hyper-concentration of social capital; increased demands on labour;
   difficulties in defining and maintaining that which is `traditional';
   and an erosion of Niuean identity.
   Based on this examination, the chapter argues that migration is likely
   to be an impact of climate change as much as it is to be an adaptation.
   Mitigation and adaptation must therefore be the preferred strategies,
   although there may be scope for carefully managed labour migration as
   part of a suite of adaptation strategies.},

   insufficiently investigated for their ability to adapt to the challenges
   posed by climate change, which hampers the implementation of mitigation
   policies. We analyzed 14 common-garden experiments across the
   Mediterranean which studied the widespread thermophilic conifer Pinus
   halepensis and involved 157 populations categorized into five ecotypes.
   Ecotype-specific tree height responses to climate were applied to
   projected climate change (2071-2100 ad), to project potential growth
   patterns both locally and across the species' range.
   We found contrasting ecotypic sensitivities to annual precipitation but
   comparatively uniform responses to mean temperature, while evidence of
   local adaptation for tree height was limited to mesic ecotypes. We
   projected intriguing patterns of response range-wide, implying either
   height inhibition or stimulation of up to 75\%, and deduced that the
   ecotype currently experiencing more favorable (wetter) conditions will
   show the largest inhibition. Extensive height reductions can be expected
   for coastal areas of France, Greece, Spain and northern Africa.
   Our findings underline the fact that intraspecific variations in
   sensitivity to precipitation must be considered when projecting tree
   height responses of dry forests to future climate. The ecotype-specific
   projected performances call for management activities to ensure forest
   resilience in the Mediterranean through, for example, tailored
   deployment strategies.},

Abstract = {Saudi Arabia is generating 194.4 billion kWh of electricity through
   500,000 barrels of oil. With the demand of electricity growing at 7.5\%
   annually, the country may need 8.3 million barrels oil per day by 2020.
   This is going to put the country as the leader among the top CO2
   emitting countries by 2020 with emissions peaking at 750 Gg of CO2 from
   the current 400,000 Gg. This is not a healthy sign for the country's
   GDP. The country can easily mitigate this problem by using the available
   wet and EGS (enhanced geothermal system) geothermal systems. 13 million
   Gg of CO2 can be mitigated by utilizing its geothermal energy sources
   for desalination plants along the western coastal region. Another 900 Gg
   can be mitigated by adopting GHP technology for space cooling and
   heating. Change in energy policy, solving tariff related issue and
   adopting CDM through geothermal energy sources, Saudi Arabia can
   mitigate CO2 emissions and still maintain its supremacy in the world.

Abstract = {Island beaches, which form significant natural and economic resources,
   are under increasing erosion risk due to sea level rise. The present
   contribution proposes an integrated methodological framework for the
   evaluation of the socio-economic significance of beaches and their
   vulnerability to sea level rise and the design of effective adaptation
   measures. The approach comprises four steps: (i) beach ranking on the
   basis of their socio-economic significance and vulnerability in order to
   prioritize adaptation responses; (ii) monitoring of the hydro- and
   morphodynamic regime of the most highly ranking beaches using field
   observations and modelling, (iii) assessment of the sediment volumes
   required for beach nourishment under different scenarios of sea level
   rise and nourishment designs; (iv) evaluation of the marine aggregate
   potential of the adjacent areas that can be used for beach nourishment.
   The framework was applied to the Greek island of Chios, which has many
   beaches that are already under erosion. The methodology was shown to
   provide a structured approach for the assessment and response to erosion
   of the most vulnerable beach.},

Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1092-1108},

Abstract = {Community-based planned adaptation has become a popular vehicle for
   building the adaptive capacity of communities vulnerable to climate
   change. In the global south, planned adaptation interventions are often
   implemented by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with the support of
   bilateral and multilateral donors. This paper examines the influence of
   external agencies involved in funding, planning and implementation of
   community-based adaptation (CBA) initiatives in Bangladesh. We show that
   the principles of CBA are negatively impacted by top-down project
   design, simplistic notions of ``community{''}, lack of downward
   accountability and pressures to meet tight timeframes. We found that
   NGO-initiated CBA interventions tended to repeat the past mistakes of
   bottom-up approaches, primarily because of embedded institutional
   culture that inhibits the possibility of achieving socially just,
   effective and sustainable adaptation outcomes in Bangladesh. We argue
   that the automatic and normative attribution of NGO interventions as
   being ``good{''} needs deconstructing to ensure that future initiatives
   are aligned with and prioritise community needs over external
   expectations. This requires flexible funding, planning and
   implementation structure for adaptation projects, which may forge new
   ways of engaging communities and locally led innovation to adapt to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Knowledge about spatial and temporal variability in the distribution and
   abundance of predators is necessary to adapt measures to mitigate
   human-wildlife interactions. Acoustic telemetry and network analyses
   were used to investigate the spatial ecology of bull sharks, the species
   responsible for most shark bites in Reunion Island, one of the world's
   shark bite hotspots. The west coast of the island was not used uniformly
   by every individual, with size predicting the movements of sharks along
   the coast. Node-based metrics - closeness, node strength, and cumulated
   continuous residency times - derived from up to 181 monthly movement
   networks from 20 individuals, revealed that smaller sharks (<250 cm
   total length) primarily used the south-west coast while larger
   individuals spent most of their time in the northern region with regular
   visits to multiple areas along the coast. This study provides essential
   knowledge on bull shark behaviour and central areas used at different
   periods of the year, which correlates well with the dynamics of observed
   shark bites. Our approach provides a non-invasive alternative to help
   predicting and anticipating human-shark conflicts and avoid shark
   culling programmes detrimental to the conservation of large predators
   such as sharks.},

Title = {The persuasiveness of gain vs. loss framed messages on farmers'
   perceptions and decisions to climate change: A case study in coastal
   communities of Vietnam},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Abstract = {Ongoing climate change results in a large increase in damaging climatic
   events that affect people's health, environment, biodiversity, and food
   security. One of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change is
   agriculture because farming relies heavily on planning for weather and
   seasons according to experience of past years, and therefore changes in
   seasons and unusual weather patterns lead to loss of crops or livestock.
   Responding to climate change impacts requires both mitigation and
   adaptation, in which communication plays an important role to raise
   awareness, change behaviours and gain policy support. Gain vs. loss
   message framing has been extensively studied in persuasive
   communication. Despite successful examples in risk communication, the
   effect of gain vs. loss message framing method in communicating climate
   change, a psychologically distant risk, is still not well understood.
   This study combines message persuasiveness with psychological distance
   to develop messages to encourage farmers on climate adaptation. We
   applied a 2 x 2 factorial design (gain/loss and abstract/concrete framed
   messages) and conducted the research in a coastal farming community (N =
   368). Findings confirm that gain-framed messages are more effective in
   raising risk perceptions and efficacy, with stronger impact on
   behavioural intentions toward climate change, compared to loss-framed
   messages. Above all, farmers were more willing to take adaptation
   measures when exposed to gain- in combination with concrete-framed
   messages vs. loss- and abstract-framed. Implications for climate change
   communication research and practice are discussed.},

   The results demonstrate the changes of equilibria in land, water, and
   biodiversity subsystems that were divided into three periods (1996-2000,
   2000-2012, and 2012-2015). The implementation of several ICMs helped to
   preserve resilient coastal ecosystems since 1997, which indicates
   effective guidance of resilient coastal management on coastal land,
   water and biodiversity. Based on trends of indicator changes, we
   identified the main indicators controlling catastrophic transformation
   of the LWB nexus system state, which include built-up area and coastal
   reclaimed area in land subsystem, seawater quality in water subsystem,
   and all four biodiversity indices. The identified key drivers to
   catastrophic regime shifts can help to navigate decision making in
   resilient coastal ecosystem management. The Xiamen case study provides a
   systematic and quantitative framework for resilience assessment of
   integrated coastal management and sustainable development.},

Title = {Reducing Sea Turtle Bycatch in the Mediterranean Mixed Demersal
   Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {The sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is the most common sea turtle in the
   Mediterranean, where incidental catches due to fishing activities are
   considered the main threat to its conservation. Over 50,000 capture
   events and likely over 10,000 deaths are estimated to occur in the
   Italian waters alone. However, current knowledge on the interaction of
   sea turtles with fishing gears and the implementation of mitigation
   measures are still poor to hinder the decline of turtle populations in
   the Mediterranean. In this basin, where fisheries are multispecies,
   multi-gears and multinational, making demersal fishing activities
   profitable while preserving sea turtles is a challenge. This study aimed
   to develop bycatch reducer devices (BRDs) and alternative fishing gears
   to mitigate the impact of demersal fishing gears on sea turtles: (a)
   hard and flexible turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were tested in bottom
   trawling to immediately exclude turtles from the net; (b) visual
   deterrents (ultraviolet LEDs) were used to illuminate set nets and to
   alter turtle visual cues, avoiding entanglement during depredation
   activity. The results showed the different devices did not affect the
   commercial catch, while bycatch reduction was instead evident. Thus, the
   study highlights that introducing mitigation measures to reduce sea
   turtle bycatch in the Mediterranean, where the bycatch of vulnerable
   species seems as a global issue, can be possible at least in certain
   areas and periods. Considering fishermen reticence to change the gear
   traditionally used, determining the optimal gear configuration to
   minimize commercial loss while reducing bycatch, is the main issue while
   introducing new technologies. Therefore, a global effort should be done
   to introduce BRDs in different areas and fisheries of the Mediterranean.},

Title = {Colonization of UK coastal realignment sites by mosquitoes: implications

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Coastal realignment is now widely instituted in the UK as part of local
   flood risk management plans to compensate for the loss of European
   protected habitat and to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise and
   coastal squeeze. Coastal aquatic habitats have long been known to
   provide suitable habitats for brackish-water mosquitoes and
   historically, coastal marshes were considered to support anopheline
   mosquito populations that were responsible for local malaria
   transmission. This study surveyed the eight largest managed realignment
   (MRA) sites in England (Essex and the Humber) for mosquito habitats. The
   apparent absence of anopheline mosquitoes exploiting aquatic habitats at
   all of these sites suggests that the risk of malaria associated with MRA
   sites is currently negligible. However, three of the eight sites
   supported populations of two nuisance and potential arboviral vector
   species, Aedes detritus and Aedes caspius. The aquatic habitats that
   supported mosquitoes resulted from a) specific design aspects of the new
   sea wall (ballast to mitigate wave action and constructed saline borrow
   ditches) that could be designed out or managed or b) isolated pools
   created through silt accretion or expansion of flooded zones to
   neighbouring pasture. The public health risks and recommendations for
   management are discussed in this report. This report highlights the need
   for pro-active public health impact assessments prior to MRA development
   in consultation with the Health Protection Agency, as well as the need
   for a case-by-case approach to design and management to mitigate
   mosquito or mosquito-borne disease issues now and in the future.},

Abstract = {Studies on the impact of climate change and sea level rise usually take
   climate scenarios as their starting point. To support long-termwater
   management planning in the Netherlands, we carried out a study that
   started at the opposite end of the effect chain. In the study we refer
   to three aspects of water management, flood defense, drinking water
   supply, and protection of the Rotterdam Harbour. We examined whether,
   and for how long, current water management strategies will continue to
   be effective under different climate change scenarios. We did this by
   applying the concept of `adaptation tipping points', and reached it if
   the magnitude of change is such that the current management strategy can
   no longer meet its objectives. Beyond the tipping points, an alternative
   adaptive strategy is needed. By applying this approach, the following
   basic questions of decision makers are answered: what are the first
   issues that we will face as a result of climate change and when can we
   expect this. The results show, for instance, that climate change and the
   rise in sea level are more likely to cause a threat to the fresh water
   supply in the west of the Netherlands than flooding. Expressing
   uncertainty in terms of the period that the existing strategy is
   effective (when will a critical point be reached) was found to be useful
   for the policy makers. (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. WIREs Clim

Abstract = {Loading of nitrogen (N) from diffuse sources to Danish marine waters was
   reduced by 41\% in the period 1990-2012 by a suite of general measures.
   However, further reductions in N loading are required if the ambitious
   quality goals of the EU Water Framework Directive are to be achieved.
   Measures will be more effective if they are implemented in N loss hot
   spots or risk areas. Additionally, the highly variable N reduction in
   groundwater and surface waters needs to be taken into account as this
   strongly influences the resulting effect of mitigation measures. The
   objectives of this study were to develop and apply an N risk tool to the
   entire agricultural land area in Denmark. The purpose of the tool is to
   identify high risk areas, i.e. areas which contribute disproportionately
   much to diffuse N losses to the marine recipient, and to suggest
   cost-effective measures to reduce losses from risk areas. In the N risk
   mapping part of the tool, we combined a modelled root zone N leaching
   with a catchment-specific N reduction factor which in combination
   determines the N load to the marine recipient. N leaching was calculated
   using detailed information of agricultural management from national
   databases as well as datasets of percolation and soil parameters as
   input parameters to an empirical N leaching model. The developed N risk
   tool showed that the Danish agricultural area is distributed almost
   evenly between N retention classes (N retention being divided into
   classes of <40\%; 40-60\%; 60-80\% and >80\% N retention). Hot spots for
   marine N loading are, however, mainly located in catchments with N
   retention less than 80\%. Hot spots for N leaching from the root zone
   are mainly located in the western part of Jutland, while hot spots for
   marine N loading are found in all regions and especially in small
   catchments close to the coast. In a case study for the catchment of the
   Danish Odense Fjord estuary, we demonstrated how the tool facilitates
   cost-effective implementation of measures and how measures can be
   combined to reach a given reduction target for an estuary. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Modern Life is enhanced by Systems of Systems (SoS). Financial systems,
   power infrastructure, transportation networks, and other SoS
   synergistically combine the resources and services of their constituent
   systems. Resilience measures SoS's ability to withstand faults, minimize
   service disruption, and efficiently recover. Current SoS resilience
   metrics, however, require improvement. Because each SoS is approached
   with different assumptions about fault magnitude and recovery strategy,
   the resilience research community currently has difficulty answering the
   basic question: Between alternative designs A and B which system is more
   resilient? A new SoS Resilience metric should reflect that the most
   potent leverage point for SoS is at the system interfaces, incorporate a
   standardized fault and recovery strategy, be easily understood by
   decision makers, incorporate SoS dynamics, and be applicable to both
   Ecosystems and Industrial SoS. In response, we develop the SoS
   Resilience Metric (SoSRM). SoSRM methodology uses the definition of SoS
   to identify appropriate fault locations and Ecological Network Analysis
   to define fault and recovery duration. As an example application, SoSRM
   is applied an Intertidal Oyster Reef Ecosystem's System Dynamics Model.
   Validation simulations demonstrate that SoSRM reflects expected fault
   impact. Additionally, methodological choices for fault duration do not
   drive SoSRM calculation results. This work presents a new tool with the
   end goal of examining two SoS to identify the more resilient.},

Title = {A 15-million-year-long record of phenotypic evolution in the heavily
   calcified coccolithophore Helicosphaera and its biogeochemical
   implications},

Abstract = {The biogeochemical impact of coccolithophores is defined not only by
   their overall abundance in the oceans but also by wide ranges in
   physiological traits such as cell size, degree of calcification and
   carbon production rates between different species. Species' sensitivity
   to environmental forcing has been suggested to relate to their cellular
   PIC : POC (particulate inorganic carbon : particulate organic carbon)
   ratio and other physiological constraints. Understanding both the
   short-term and longer-term adaptive strategies of different
   coccolithophore lineages, and how these in turn shape the biogeochemical
   role of the group, is therefore crucial for modeling the ongoing changes
   in the global carbon cycle. Here we present data on the phenotypic
   evolution of a large and heavily calcified genus Helicosphaera (order
   Zygodiscales) over the past 15 million years (Myr), at two deep-sea
   drill sites in the tropical Indian Ocean and temperate South Atlantic.
   The modern species Helicosphaera carteri, which displays
   ecophysiological adaptations in modern strains, was used to benchmark
   the use of its coccolith morphology as a physiological proxy in the
   fossil record.
   Our results show that, on the single-genotype level, coccolith
   morphology has no correlation with growth rates, cell size or PIC and
   POC production rates in H. carteri. However, significant correlations of
   coccolith morphometric parameters with cell size and physiological rates
   do emerge once multiple genotypes or closely related lineages are pooled
   together. Using this insight, we interpret the phenotypic evolution in
   Helicosphaera as a global, resource-limitation-driven selection for
   smaller cells, which appears to be a common adaptive trait among
   different coccolithophore lineages, from the warm and high-CO2 world of
   the middle Miocene to the cooler and low-CO2 conditions of the
   Pleistocene. However, despite a significant decrease in mean coccolith
   size and cell size, Helicosphaera kept a relatively stable PIC : POC
   ratio (as inferred from the coccolith aspect ratio) and thus highly
   conservative biogeochemical output on the cellular level. We argue that
   this supports its status as an obligate calcifier, like other large and
   heavily calcified genera such as Calcidiscus and Coccolithus, and that
   other adaptive strategies, beyond size adaptation, must support the
   persistent, albeit less abundant, occurrence of these taxa. This is in
   stark contrast with the ancestral lineage of Emiliania and Gephyrocapsa,
   which not only decreased in mean size but also displayed much higher
   phenotypic plasticity in their degree of calcification while becoming

Abstract = {Cities have started to anticipate the effects of global warming dealing
   with flood management. Indeed, it seems that this last decade, flood
   risk has increased and cities are facing on the one hand more frequent
   hazards, and on the other hand different types of flooding: fluvial,
   coastal, estuarial and pluvial. Most cities have to manage at least two
   of these flooding types. At the same time, flood risk management
   practices have changed step-by-step. Indeed, despite efforts made to
   maintain the flood defense assets well, we often observe failures
   leading to finally increase flood risk in protected areas during major
   flood events. Moreover, flood forecasting models, although they benefit
   from continuous improvements, remain partly inaccurate due to
   uncertainties populated all along data calculation processes. This means
   cities cannot continue to manage flood risk only by the use of flood
   defenses: sustainable options have to be designed to better mitigate the
   effects of flooding in urban area and in a long term strategy. Several
   European cities have suffered recent flooding events. It was the case
   for example in 2007 in United Kingdom. During this period, major events
   came from extreme rainfall and it appears that pluvial flood risk has
   become one of the most frequent events. In this context, flood risk can
   appear on every territory: cities have to develop some methods to take
   into account this new deal, options to achieve urban flood resilience.
   Some solutions that cities are using or will be able to set up in the
   near future will be described.},

Title = {An urban energy balance-guided machine learning approach for synthetic
   nocturnal surface Urban Heat Island prediction: A heatwave event in
   Naples},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {805},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Southern European functional urban areas (FUAs) are increasingly subject
   to heatwave (HW) events, calling for an-ticipated climate adaptation
   measures. In the urban context, such adaptation strategies require a
   thorough under-standing of the built-up response to the incoming solar
   radiation, i.e., the urban energy balance cycle and its implications for
   the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Despite readily available, diurnal
   Land Surface Temperature (LST) data does not provide a meaningful
   picture of the UHI, in these midlatitudes FUAs. On the contrary, the
   mid-morning satellite overpass is characterized by the absence of a
   significant surface UHI (SUHI) signal, corre-sponding to the period of
   the day when the urban-rural air temperature difference is typically
   negative. Conversely, nocturnal high-resolution LST data is rarely
   available. In this study, an energy balance-based machine learning
   ap-proach is explored, considering the Local Climate Zones (LCZ), to
   describe the daily cycle of the heat flux components and predict the
   nocturnal SUHI, during an HW event. While the urban and rural spatial
   outlines are not visible in the diurnal thermal image, they become
   apparent in the latent and storage heat flux maps - built-up
   infrastructures up -take heat during the day which is released back into
   the atmosphere, during the night, whereas vegetation land sur-faces
   loose diurnal heat through evapotranspiration. For the LST prediction
   model, a random forest (RF) approach is implemented. RF results show
   that the model accurately predicts the LST, ensuring mean square errors
   inferior to 0.1 K. Both the latent and storage heat flux components,
   together with LCZ classification, are the most important ex-planatory
   variables for the nocturnal LST prediction, supporting the adoption of
   the energy balance approach. In fu -ture research, other locations and
   time-series data shall be trained and tested, providing an efficient
   local urban climate monitoring tool, where in-situ air temperature
   observations are not available. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Changes in sea ice, snow cover, lake and river ice, and permafrost will
   affect economy, infrastructure, health, and indigenous and

   resilient and highly adaptive, but the rate and magnitude of change
   challenges the current adaptive capacity. Cryospheric changes create
   both challenges and opportunities, and occur along local, regional, and
   international dimensions. Such changes will provide better access to the
   Arctic and its resources thereby increasing human activities such as
   shipping and tourism. Cryospheric changes pose a number of challenges
   for international governance, human rights, safety, and search and
   rescue efforts. In addition to the direct effects of a changing
   cryosphere, human society is affected by indirect factors, including
   industrial developments, globalization, and societal changes, which
   contribute to shaping vulnerability and adaptation options. Combined
   with non-cryospheric drivers of change, this will result in multifaceted
   and cascading effects within and beyond the Arctic.},

Title = {Trends and drivers of land surface temperature along the urban-rural
   gradients in the largest urban agglomeration of China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {711},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Urban heat magnitude and effects may represent harbingers of future
   climate change and the urban-rural gradients provide a unique natural
   laboratory for identifying both problems and solutions to climate change
   mitigation and adaptation. Here, we explored the trends and driving
   forces of land surface temperature (LST) along the urban-rural gradients
   of 26 cities in the largest urban agglomeration of China, the Yangtze
   River Delta Urban Agglomeration, using MODIS LST data combined with
   urban intensity, background climate, vegetation greenness, landscape
   structure, albedo, population and gross domestic product (GDP). We found
   that LST generally increased with increasing urban intensity along the
   urban-rural gradients while with large diurnal and seasonal variability.
   Large variability also existed between the maximum and minimum LST
   within the same urban intensity (e.g., 6.4 degrees C), suggesting cities
   themselves provide ready-made solutions (minimum) to resolving heat
   island problems. However, the range of LST within the same intensity
   decreased with the urban intensity and narrowed drastically when the
   intensity reached certain thresholds (e.g., 58-87\% varying with season,
   time of day, and city), implying that the space for climate mitigation
   is very limited once the urbanization intensity exceeds critical
   thresholds. The roles of landscape structure (composition and
   configuration) for greenspace and urban land have become increasingly
   important in driving the variation of LST with increasing urban
   intensity from low (20\%-30\%), middle (45\%-55\%) to high (70\%80\%),
   clearly indicating that subtle urban landscape designing, such as less
   aggregated urban configuration and more irregular greenspace shape are
   effective strategies to mitigate climate change in highly urbanized
   areas and cities themselves already provide such vivid demonstrations
   for us to find and learn. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cool roof technology is an energy efficient, financially viable and
   sustainable solution for mitigating heat islands and reducing building
   energy consumption for cooling. An EU supported project called Cool
   Roofs has achieved to promote this technology in the EU by the
   implementation of an Action Plan. The work is developed in four axes,
   technical, market, policy and end-users. The Action Plan is steered by
   the development of the European Cool Roof Council that brings together
   all related stakeholders. The main results of the project include the
   creation of the European Cool Roof Council (ECRC), five cool roof pilot
   studies, a database of cool roofing materials, a handbook and a toolkit
   to assist the better understanding of the technical aspects of the
   technology, a market promotion plan, a proposal for a successful
   strategy to overcome possible policy barriers and engage with key
   stakeholders who could support and accelerate the creation of an EU
   policy and regulatory friendly environment to cool roofs, the
   organization of workshops and seminars and other actions of
   dissemination. This paper presents the main achievements at EU level
   regarding the establishment of cool roofs as heat island mitigation
   strategy and a measure for reducing cooling loads. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {The second version of the modified TOMGRO model was used to simulate the
   production of a tomato crop in 8 hypothetical greenhouse adaptations in
   the Bogota Plateau; near to the equator and at 2650 m above sea level.
   An inflatable polyethylene tube, a thermal screen, heating and CO2
   fertilisation were evaluated. With these strategies a range of average
   temperatures between 14.7 and 20.0 degrees C was calculated, using some
   basic assumptions that were deduced from literature and from previous
   experiments. The maximum productivity and gross income increased as the
   average greenhouse temperature increased, despite small decreases in
   greenhouse transmissivity due to the installation of a PE tube or
   climate screen. The maximum productivity without CO2 fertilisation was
   obtained in a treatment heated to maintain a minimum temperature of 18
   degrees C, resulting in a fruit yield of 41.7 kg center dot m(-2) for a
   300-day growth period. For each climate treatment, a combination of
   planting density and fruit pruning can be selected to obtain the desired
   average fruit weight in a range of nearly 25 g, without affecting gross
   income. Only a small effect of CO2 fertilisation was detected, due to
   the opening of the greenhouse during most of the day. The simulation
   model showed reasonable results, in accordance to data from the growers,
   and can thus be used for calculating other hypothetical climate
   adaptation strategies and evaluate micro-climates in the high altitude
   tropics.},

Abstract = {This article surveys secular urban sandy beaches erosion accretion and

   mouths (Carrasco and Pando), with different characteristics but all
   constrained by coastal linear infrastructure were studied. These sites
   are located along the urbanised coast of the middle region of Rio de la
   Plata microtidal river estuary. All of them show a more or less strong
   retreat trend with alternated fluctuations, e.g., weak retreat likely
   due to sea level rise, significant erosion very likely due to storm
   surges, and processes of loss of sediment stock, as well as episodes of
   sand recovery. Therefore, these beaches require interventions to
   preserve their beach prism and dry sand surface. In search for answers
   to better understand why and under what conditions the process of
   advance and retreat of the coastline occur, we have analysed different
   teleconnections and carried out reanalyses for wind anomalies during
   ENSO events from 1951 to 2010. Both weak and moderate erosion accretion
   periods are likely related to atmospheric anomalies, e.g., wind
   direction changes and the consequent swell and littoral drift changes,
   related' to El Nino and La Nina events. The former associated with
   accretion and the latter with erosion. In the past most interventions
   have been reactive. Increased knowledge of climate and weather
   relationship with the sedimentary balance provides an approach that
   would allow developing beach risk-management, pro-active strategies and
   climate adaption measures focused on the generation and recovery
   planning based on the analysis of the occurrence and prediction of El
   Nino/La Nina events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Grand Challenges in Understanding the Interplay of Climate and Land
   Changes},
Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Half of Earth's land surface has been altered by human activities,
   creating various consequences on the climate and weather systems at
   local to global scales, which in turn affect a myriad of land surface
   processes and the adaptation behaviors. This study reviews the status
   and major knowledge gaps in the interactions of land and atmospheric
   changes and present 11 grand challenge areas for the scientific research
   and adaptation community in the coming decade. These land-cover and
   land-use change (LCLUC)-related areas include 1) impacts on weather and
   climate, 2) carbon and other biogeochemical cycles, 3) biospheric
   emissions, 4) the water cycle, 5) agriculture, 6) urbanization, 7)
   acclimation of biogeochemical processes to climate change, 8) plant
   migration, 9) land-use projections, 10) model and data uncertainties,
   and, finally, 11) adaptation strategies. Numerous studies have
   demonstrated the effects of LCLUC on local to global climate and weather
   systems, but these putative effects vary greatly in magnitude and even
   sign across space, time, and scale and thus remain highly uncertain. At
   the same time, many challenges exist toward improved understanding of
   the consequences of atmospheric and climate change on land process
   dynamics and services. Future effort must improve the understanding of
   the scale-dependent, multifaceted perturbations and feedbacks between
   land and climate changes in both reality and models. To this end, one
   critical cross-disciplinary need is to systematically quantify and
   better understand measurement and model uncertainties. Finally, LCLUC
   mitigation and adaptation assessments must be strengthened to identify
   implementation barriers, evaluate and prioritize opportunities, and
   examine how decisionmaking processes work in specific contexts.},

Abstract = {Mega structures for CO2 storage, such as the Utsira formation in the
   North Sea, could theoretically supply CO2 storage capacity for several
   countries for a period of several decades. Their use could increase the
   cost-effectiveness of CCS in a region while minimizing opposition from
   the public to CO2 storage. However, this will not only depend on their
   potential available capacity to store CO2 flows but also on the cost
   effectiveness of such an option within national portfolios of mitigation
   measures. This article shows key results of a research project aiming to
   assess the potentials and costs of storing CO2 in the Utsira formation
   for the time period 2015-2050. Countries included in the analysis are
   Denmark, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The
   starting point of the analysis are the national MARKAL and TIMES models
   developed for each country together with the 27 region Pan European
   TIMES model (PET). In the models scenarios, assumptions and parameters
   that are not country dependent (e. g. costs related with CO2 capture
   technology development) have been harmonized. The results indicate that
   with stringent climate targets, CCS appears as a key mitigation option
   in the national portfolio of measures. Within the CCS portfolio, storage
   of CO2 in the Utsira formation can indeed be a cost effective option for
   North Europe and it represents a valuable CO2 storage option at the
   regional level. For instance, the United Kingdom will profit from the
   comparably short transport distance to Utsira while the Netherlands
   utilise the Utsira formation due to limited domestic low cost storage
   fields and the use of the country as a regional hub for CO2. In Germany
   and Denmark, the competitiveness of CO2 storage in Utsira is determined
   by the availability of domestic onshore saline aquifers. If these
   aquifers are not used, Utsira gains as competitive storage option. The
   main limitation for the common use of the Utsira formation appears, from
   a modeling point of view, to be the maximum annual injection rate for
   CO2 that has been assumed in the project (150 Mt CO2/yr). (C) 2011

Abstract = {Analysis of coastal climate change adaptation requires combining
   environmental and resource economics with other disciplines. Sea level
   rise, ocean warming and acidification, and increased storminess threaten
   to alter or intensify biophysical coastal changes. Communities respond
   in ways that neither maximize total economic value nor apply the
   appropriate spatial scale of policy response. Focusing on coastline
   change, particularly in North Carolina, we synthesize modeling
   approaches and empirical studies to identify research that is needed to
   support coastal climate adaptation policy. Modeling coastlines as
   coupled human-natural systems explains historical patterns of coastline
   change, clarifies the need for empirical estimates, and provides a
   roadmap for interdisciplinary policy analysis. Despite the extensive
   literature on coastal amenities, hazards, and ex post policy evaluation,
   more empirical information is needed to parameterize coupled models of
   complex coastal environments facing climate change. Extending coupled
   models of coastal adaptation to incorporate spatial dynamics and market
   and nonmarket values highlights fundamental problems with current
   governance structures. We conclude that to maximize total economic value
   in the coastal zone, adaptation will require governance coordination
   across multiple levels, attention to intensive and extensive margins of
   adaptation, and trade-offs across market and nonmarket values. These
   findings echo recent advances in fisheries bioeconomics.},

Abstract = {The damage and injury that ground level ozone (O-3) causes vegetation
   has become increasingly evident over the past half century with a large
   body of observational and experimental evidence demonstrating a variety
   of effects at ambient concentrations on crop, forest and grassland
   species and ecosystems. This paper explores the use of experimental data
   to develop exposure-response relationships for use in risk assessment
   studies. These studies have typically identified the USA mid-West, much
   of Europe, the Indo Gangetic Plain in South Asia and the Eastern coastal
   region of China as global regions where O-3 is likely to threaten food
   supply and other ecosystems. Global risk assessment modelling estimates
   yield losses of staple crops between 3 to 16\% causing economic losses
   of between US\$14 to 26 billion in the year 2000. Changes in
   anthropogenic emissions of O-3 precursors in recent decades have
   modified O-3 concentration profiles (peaks versus background O-3) and
   global distributions with the Northern Hemisphere seeing increases in
   O-3 levels of between 1 and 5ppb/decade since the 1950s and the
   emergence of Asia as the region with the highest O-3 concentrations. In
   the future, O-3 mitigation could focus on methane (CH4) and nitrogen
   oxide (NOx) emissions; these will differentially influence global and
   local/regional O-3 concentrations and influence daily and seasonal
   profiles. The consequent effects on vegetation will in part depend on
   how these changes in O-3 profile alter the exceedance of detoxification
   thresholds for plant damage. Adaptation options may play an important
   role in enhancing food supply while mitigation strategies are being
   implemented. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which O-3
   affects plants, and how this might influence detoxification thresholds
   and interactions with other environmental variables such as water stress
   and nutrients, would help develop O-3 deposition and impact models to
   support the development of crop, land-surface exchange and ultimately
   earth system models for holistic assessments of global change. This
   article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Air quality, past present
   and future'.},

Abstract = {Isla Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
   has repeatedly witnessed catastrophic disasters that caused dramatic
   economic losses and killed thousands of people over the last decades.
   One striking example is the disastrous flood event that hit the
   transnational basin of River Soliette on 24 May 2004. The event resulted
   from a severe tropical storm and killed over 1000 Haitian and 400
   Dominican people. In the context of an International Cooperation
   Initiative, the University of Bologna led several activities in the
   fields of flood risk assessment, management and mitigation, and
   sustainable development planning for the Soliette river basin. This
   paper presents new techniques for a timely assessment of flood risk in
   data-scarce and remote areas in developing countries showing in
   particular: (1) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based
   topographic survey of the Soliette riverbed, carried out under urgent
   temporal, logistical and technical constraints, and (2) some possible
   utilisations of the collected topographic data for the identification of
   structural and non-structural flood risk mitigation measures. The
   analysis enabled us to set and test a GNSS-based technique for fast,
   reliable and detailed topographic surveys in remote regions, which
   represents a valid option for similar areas with limited accessibility
   in emerging and developing countries.},

Abstract = {Developing countries with agrarian economy have been facing challenges
   arising from climate change events and its consequences. Climate
   knowledge influences the adaptation and mitigation measures shielding
   farm households in climatically vulnerable regions. Indian states with
   climatically vulnerable coastal and non-coastal agro-ecosystems have
   dominantly an agrarian economy; and small and marginal farmers'
   livelihoods are under focus through implementation of National
   Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) by the Indian
   Council of Agricultural Research. The present study was undertaken in
   one such state, Odisha. Climate knowledge test was developed following
   appropriate methods and administered to 200 farmers, 100 each in coastal
   and non-coastal NICRA districts to assess the knowledge level of
   dominant livelihood groups. Farmers' climate knowledge was higher in
   coastal district as compared to non-coastal district with overall
   climate knowledge index values of 53.10 and 43.95, respectively. Farmers
   who engaged in crop + livestock farming have better climate knowledge as
   compared to crop farmers and livestock farmers. Multiple regression and
   path analyses revealed social, economic, communication and psychological
   attributes of the farmers determining their climate knowledge level.
   Education level, social participation, participation in community
   initiatives, annual family income and personal cosmopolite information
   sources use are few such important determinants of climate knowledge.
   These dimensions require attention for the policy advocacies to improve
   climate knowledge so as to shield climatically vulnerable farm
   households.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a current subject that is attracting more and more
   attention, whether from academics or the public. This public attention
   is mainly due to the frequently published news in the media, reporting
   consequences caused by extreme weather events. On the other hand,
   scientists are looking into the origins of the phenomenon, seeking
   answers that will somehow help to mitigate the effects of climate
   change. This article presents a review of some of the different possible
   approaches taken on climate change, to demonstrate the need to build a
   multidisciplinary perspective of the problem. It is understood that only
   the integration of different perspectives, presented by different areas
   of knowledge, such as natural sciences, social and economic sciences and
   human sciences, will make it possible to build modeling and predictive
   scenarios, which realistically may represent the development of the
   earth system under the influence of climate change. In this way, with
   the support of all areas of knowledge, the creation of forecast models
   where all possible changes to the different variables of the earth
   system may be simulated will allow for the mitigation measures presented
   to be analyzed in advance and, thus, prioritized. This review shows that
   a multi and interdisciplinary approach, based on the knowledge acquired
   from different knowledge and science fields, presents itself as the way
   to solve this global and complex problem caused by climate change.},

Abstract = {Increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are predicted to adversely
   impact coral populations worldwide through increasing thermal bleaching
   events. Future bleaching is unlikely to be spatially uniform. Therefore,
   understanding what determines regional differences will be critical for
   adaptation management. Here, using a cumulative heat stress metric, we
   show that characteristics of regional SST determine the future bleaching
   risk patterns. Incorporating observed information on SST variability, in
   assessing future bleaching risk, provides novel options for management
   strategies. As a consequence, the known biases in climate model
   variability and the uncertainties in regional warming rate across
   climate models are less detrimental than previously thought. We also
   show that the thresholds used to indicate reef viability can strongly
   influence a decision on what constitutes a potential refugia. Observing
   and understanding the drivers of regional variability, and the viability
   limits of coral reefs, is therefore critical for making meaningful
   projections of coral bleaching risk.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {How fisheries will be impacted by climate change is far from understood.
   While some fish populations may be able to escape global warming via
   range shifts, they cannot escape ocean acidification (OA), an inevitable
   consequence of the dissolution of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions in marine waters. How ocean acidification affects population
   dynamics of commercially important fish species is critical for adapting
   management practices of exploited fish populations. Ocean acidification
   has been shown to impair fish larvae's sensory abilities, affect the
   morphology of otoliths, cause tissue damage and cause behavioural
   changes. Here, we obtain first experimental mortality estimates for
   Atlantic cod larvae under OA and incorporate these effects into
   recruitment models. End-of-century levels of ocean acidification
   (similar to 1100 mu atm according to the IPCC RCP 8.5) resulted in a
   doubling of daily mortality rates compared to present-day CO2
   concentrations during the first 25 days post hatching (dph), a critical
   phase for population recruitment. These results were consistent under
   different feeding regimes, stocking densities and in two cod populations
   (Western Baltic and Barents Sea stock). When mortality data were
   included into Ricker-type stock-recruitment models, recruitment was
   reduced to an average of 8 and 24\% of current recruitment for the two
   populations, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of
   including vulnerable early life stages when addressing effects of
   climate change on fish stocks.},

Title = {Building effective fishery ecosystem plans},

Abstract = {U.S. fisheries management has made tremendous strides under the current
   management framework, which centers on single stocks rather than
   ecosystems. However, conventional management focuses on one fishing
   sector at a time, considers a narrow range of issues, and is separated
   into individual fishery management plans often leaving little
   opportunity to consider overarching management goals across fisheries.
   Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management (EBFM) provides mechanisms to
   address these but has not been widely adopted. Here, we review and
   analyze the development of Fisheries Ecosystem Plans (FEPs) as a means
   to implement EBFM. In doing so, we provide a blueprint for
   next-generation PEPS that have the potential to translate EBFM to
   action. We highlight FEPs as a structured planning process that uses
   adaptive management to operationalize EBFM. This ``FEP Loop{''} process
   starts by identifying the key factors that shape a fishery system and
   considering them simultaneously, as a coherent whole. It then helps
   managers and stakeholders delineate their overarching goals for the
   system and refine them Into specific, realistic projects. And it charts
   a course forward with a set of management actions that work in concert
   to achieve the highest-priority objectives. We conclude that EBFM is
   feasible today using existing science tools, policy instruments, and
   management structures. Not only that, nearly all of the steps in the
   proposed ``PEP Loop{''} process are presently being carried out by U.S.

Abstract = {This paper describes the scientific aspects analysed in the preparatory
   phase of a Master Plan of interventions to mitigate the risk of coastal
   erosion in Calabria. The Plan has recently been developed by the
   regional administration to define in an objective manner a scale of
   priorities for the planning and intervention of the medium and long-term
   re-equilibrium of the coastline. The analyses developed in this paper
   allow us to correctly evaluate, from several points of view, the
   consequences of possible proposed solutions, and thence to make choices
   based on accurate documentation and reliable analysis of the physical,
   environmental, social and economic aspects, all of which are closely
   interrelated.
   Such a Master Plan is necessary in Calabria both because of the
   geographic shape of the land, characterized by a coastline over 700 km
   long and which is fundamentally important to the regional economy, and
   also because of the presence of a significant number of past ad hoc
   interventions in coastal defence, often carried out by different
   institutional bodies, as a matter of urgency, and in areas of limited
   access, generally without sound or effective design or general vision of
   the problem, the result of which has only served to shift, in spatial
   and temporary terms, the problem of coastal erosion. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {A review of interventions proposed to abate impacts of ocean
   acidification on coral reefs},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coral reefs experiencing ocean acidification (OA) are likely to recover
   much more slowly from damage caused by acute events such as mass
   bleaching because OA slows coral reef growth and reproduction. To
   maintain reefs in a net growth or net-neutral condition, curbing the
   impact of OA is therefore necessary. A variety of mitigation and
   adaptation strategies have been proposed to abate OA impacts on reefs.
   However, detailed guidance for managers on the types, effectiveness, or
   costs of different local interventions to address OA is scarce. To
   advance the discussion about available interventions, this review
   explores and compares mitigation and adaptation techniques that have
   been proposed to abate OA impacts on coral reefs. We focus primarily on
   four categories of interventions intended to address different ecosystem
   service changes: phytoremediation, chemical remediation, reef
   restoration, and assisted evolution. We briefly touch on traditional
   restoration methods like marine protected areas (MPAs) and reducing
   secondary sources of stress. Of the techniques reviewed, most are costly
   and do not scale at the same pace as global reef loss. Nor do they
   address the root cause of OA, global carbon emissions. That said,
   intervention should not be an all or nothing approach; some techniques
   may be worth implementing at smaller scales in a coordinated way.
   Working to save pieces of ecosystems and buying time may help ensure
   that there is more to rebuild from in the future. Despite the seemingly
   high price tag of many of these techniques, given the potential value of
   regained ecosystem services, net gains may exceed implementation costs.
   It is certain, however, from the limited reach of coral reef
   interventions, that they must be undertaken as part of a suite of
   global-scale interventions including atmospheric CO2 reduction to
   preserve coral reef ecosystem function and benefits to humanity. (C)

Abstract = {Before switching totally to alternative fuel stage, CO2 mitigation
   process has considered a transitional strategy for combustion of fossil
   fuels inevitably. In comparison to other CO2 mitigation options, such as
   oceanic or geologic injection, the biological photosynthetic process
   would present a far superior and sustainable solution under both
   environmental and social considerations. The utilization of the
   cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. CH1 in carbon dioxide mitigation processes is
   analyzed in our research. It was found that an original developed
   photobioreactor with internal light source exhibits high light
   utilization. Anabaena sp. CH1 demonstrates excellent CO2 tolerance even
   at 15\% CO2 level. This enables flue gas from power plant to be directly
   introduced to Anabaena sp. CH1 culture. Double light intensity and
   increased 47\% CO2 bubble retention time could enhance CO2 removal
   efficiencies by 79\% and 67\%, respectively. A maximum CO2 fixation rate
   of 1.01 g CO2 L-1 day(-1) was measured experimentally. (C) 2011

Title = {Coastal flooding in the Maldives: an assessment of historic events and
   their implications},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {89},

Abstract = {With many inhabited islands only at about 1 m above mean sea level, the
   Maldives is among the nations most threatened by coastal flooding and
   sea level rise. However, the understanding of recent coastal flood
   events in the Maldives is limited and is important to understanding
   future flood threats. This paper assesses (1) the sea level and wave
   climate of the Maldives, (2) the sea level and wave conditions during
   recent coastal flood events, and (3) the implications for flood
   management and future research. The analysis uses observed still water
   levels (1987-2015) and hindcast wave conditions (1979-2015). Two
   significant flood events on 10-13 April 1987 and 15-17 May 2007 are
   examined in detail. This shows that coastal flooding in the Maldives
   occurs due to multiple interacting sources. These include long-period
   (up to 20 s) energetic waves generated in the Southern Ocean combined
   with spring tides. Wave run-up (mainly wave set-up) appears an essential
   mechanism for a flood, but is currently poorly quantified. However, as
   sea levels continue to rise the conditions that produce a flood will
   occur more frequently, suggesting that flooding will become common in
   the Maldives. This analysis is a starting point for future research and
   highlights the need to continue research on flood sources, pathways and
   receptors, and plan adaptation measures. Priorities include monitoring
   of waves, sea levels and flood events, and a better understanding of
   set-up (and other shallow water processes over reefs).},

Abstract = {Traditional burning regimes have long been employed to enhance
   biodiversity and mitigate high-intensity wildfires. The link between
   changes in the distribution, success, and timing of breeding in seabirds
   and climatic and oceanographic variation in the marine environment has
   been established, with migratory seabirds less able to respond to
   climate variability than resident species. While climate-driven changes
   can also occur on seabird breeding islands, few data are available
   regarding potential impacts. Here we investigate the frequency and
   severity of bushfires on seabird breeding islands in Western Australia,
   regarding the 2020 fire on Figure of Eight Island in the Recherche
   Archipelago. A lack of quantitative, historical surveys limited our
   ability to quantify the number of shearwaters lost in this event.
   However, a review of available data suggests thousands of birds die due
   to burning every one or two years across the Archipelago. On Figure of
   Eight, shearwater burrow occupancy and density were low 12 months
   post-burn (0.25 and 0.02 +/- 0.03, respectively), with minimal evidence
   of recovery (very few burrows detected) 23 months post-burn. We discuss
   opportunities to develop an adaptive, community-based program for
   reinstating collaborative, cultural methods of fire management and
   monitoring regimes on seabird breeding islands in Australia.},

Abstract = {Assessment of vulnerability is essential for identifying and recognizing
   the coastal livelihood, socio-economic and ecological security status.
   However, coastal vulnerability assessments require a complex dataset
   including human and socio-economic factors. In this study, we
   investigated coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to map the vulnerability
   of Tuticorin coast toward coastal erosion using remote sensing data and
   geographical information techniques based on a multi-indicator approach.
   Gulf of Mannar located along the southeast coast of India and declared
   as a marine national park with high ecological diversity faces threat
   due to anthropogenic interventions as a result of industrialization,
   sand and coral mining, etc. CVI highlights the vicinity where the
   physical effects may be the greatest. Beach width was considered as an
   additional parameter, since a large number of coastal habitations were
   present adjacent to the beach along the study area. Coastal erosion,
   slope and relative sea level rise are the major factors affecting the
   coastal vulnerability in Tuticorin. CVI scores were categorized into
   four classes, viz., low, moderate, high and very high risk. Out of 84-km
   coastal stretch, 15 \% falls under high risk, 12 \% moderate
   vulnerability and 73 \% the low vulnerable category. This approach
   provides an insight to assess the vulnerability and the degree of
   potential threat to the coastal system in order to prioritize actions
   and to develop adaptation measures.},

Title = {Mapping the irrecoverable carbon in Earth's ecosystems},
Journal = {NATURE SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-46},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Avoiding catastrophic climate change requires rapid decarbonization and
   improved ecosystem stewardship at a planetary scale. The carbon released
   through the burning of fossil fuels would take millennia to regenerate
   on Earth. Though the timeframe of carbon recovery for ecosystems such as
   peatlands, mangroves and old-growth forests is shorter (centuries), this
   timeframe still exceeds the time we have remaining to avoid the worst
   impacts of global warming. There are some natural places that we cannot
   afford to lose due to their irreplaceable carbon reserves. Here we map
   `irrecoverable carbon' globally to identify ecosystem carbon that
   remains within human purview to manage and, if lost, could not be
   recovered by mid-century, by when we need to reach net-zero emissions to
   avoid the worst climate impacts. Since 2010, agriculture, logging and
   wildfire have caused emissions of at least 4.0 Gt of irrecoverable
   carbon. The world's remaining 139.1 +/- 443.6 Gt of irrecoverable carbon
   faces risks from land-use conversion and climate change. These risks can
   be reduced through proactive protection and adaptive management.
   Currently, 23.0\% of irrecoverable carbon is within protected areas and
   33.6\% is managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities. Half of
   Earth's irrecoverable carbon is concentrated on just 3.3\% of its land,
   highlighting opportunities for targeted efforts to increase global
   climate security.
   Avoiding catastrophic climate change requires that we avoid losing key
   natural carbon reserves. This study maps such irrecoverable carbon
   globally and finds a third of the remaining managed by Indigenous
   peoples and local communities and nearly a quarter in protected areas.},

Title = {Effect of Hatchery Nest Environment on Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys
   olivacea) Hatchling Performance},
Journal = {CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {60-70},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The nest environment plays an important role in influencing sea turtle
   hatchling phenotype. Increasing global temperatures can potentially
   cause detrimental changes to hatchling size and performance and
   ultimately influence their recruitment into the adult population. The
   mass nesting rookeries of olive ridleys in Odisha on the east coast of
   India are among the largest globally and the only major ones outside
   Central America. Many nests laid on the east coast of India are
   translocated to hatcheries as part of hatchery management practices.
   Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of temperature on
   hatchlings produced in hatcheries as well as site-specific factors in
   order to undertake appropriate climate-resilient hatchery management
   measures. This study examined the effect of temperature on the
   morphology and locomotor performance of hatchlings produced in 2
   different hatcheries on the east coast: in Rushikulya, Odisha, and in
   Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. We examined various size (body, flipper, and
   neck length) and performance (crawl speed, righting ability, and
   righting propensity) parameters for hatchlings at both hatcheries across
   a range of temperatures. We found that hatchling size and performance
   were significantly influenced by nest incubation temperature. Higher
   incubation temperatures resulted in smaller hatchling size, which in
   turn was correlated with lower performance variables. Incubation
   temperature also had a direct effect on hatchling performance
   independent of hatchling size. The effect of nest temperature on
   morphology and performance of hatchlings could influence their survival
   and recruitment rates, thus influencing population dynamics and
   resilience to climate change.},

Abstract = {Timber structures located near water and sensitive environments face
   increased threats of deterioration from decay fungi, marine borers and
   insects. These include bridges, bulkheads, piers, docks, foundation
   pilings and other structures. Preservative treated timber products have
   a long history of providing creative, economical and sustainable design
   options for such structures featuring effective protection against such
   threats. Concerns about the potential impacts of the wood preservatives
   on the environment can be addressed through a systematic approach of
   evaluating risks, utilizing applicable mitigating measures and managing
   aspects of the timber product selection, preservative choice and
   installation. The U.S. wood treating industry has developed a number of
   tools to guide preservative selection for such projects based on the
   specific conditions, including an online Environmental Assessment Model
   and a Best Management Practices program. When these measures are
   properly considered on a project- basis, there is a high probability
   that the preserved timber will have a long service life and potential
   risks will be minimal and manageable for environmentally safe use.},

Title = {Ecomimesis: A Sustainable Design Paradigm Ecomimetic Solutions to
   Ecosystem Homeostatic Imbalances},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {255-266},
Abstract = {In the last fifty years empirical evidence has shown that climate change
   and environmental degradation are largely the results of increased world
   population, economic development, and changes in cultural and social
   norms. During this time period, there have been over 500 international
   agreements to stem the deterioration of the land, sea, and air. Despite
   all the evidence and treaties, however, climate change is getting worse
   with ever increasing air and water pollution, soil and ocean
   degradation, and ecosystem decline. Based on extensive research, this
   paper provides an analysis of the negative anthropogenic impact on the
   ecosystem and proposes a new design solution to mitigate and repair
   environmental degradation: ecomimesis. It is different from other design
   models because it incorporates all the major components of the ecosystem
   and designs built and un-built ecosystems to minimize adverse effects
   and help stabilize the environment. Using nature as its template,
   econmimesis conserves, repairs, and improves existing ecosystems. This
   article uses homeostasis as an example of possible ecomimetic designs.
   It is described with emphasis on the damage inflicted by anthropogenic
   actions. It primary focus is to propose ecomimetic solutions to repair
   and mitigate the damage in both the built and unbuilt ecosystems. While
   there is no single solution to the environmental challenge, ecomimesis
   represents a comprehensive design paradigm that will slow and correct
   environmental decline. Ecomimesis represents an innovative and broad
   change in the way we design and use our ecosystems in order to support
   an ever growing world population.},

Title = {The evolution of legal instruments and the sustainability of the
   Peruvian anchovy fishery},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-89},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Landings statistics of the Peruvian anchovy fishery show that the
   fishery went through a phase of explosive and uncontrolled growth from
   its establishment in the mid-fifties until its collapse in 1972. After
   the collapse, a second phase from 1973 to 1984 was characterized by
   unfavorable warm ocean conditions and low catches. A third phase, from
   1984 to the present, with propitious ocean-environmental conditions and
   modern governance, can be further divided into a controlled growth
   period (1985-1994) and a sustainable landings' period (1995 to present).
   The most recent period of the third phase has enabled the fishery to
   maintain its catches and be labeled as one of the most sustainable
   fisheries worldwide. This article highlights the evolution of the legal
   system that provides for the current sustainable landings and governance
   of this fishery. Results show that General Fisheries Acts were enacted
   independently of failures to sustain anchovy landings. The three
   Peruvian Fisheries Acts were a reflection of broader national
   socio-political changes and were enacted mainly to define the role of
   the state and private investment and to delimit foreign involvement in
   the fishery industry. By contrast, the enactment of secondary
   legislation to control quotas and fishing seasons increased as the
   fishery moved towards stable landings. During this phase, enacted
   secondary legislation showed also a clear peak during strong positive
   sea surface anomalies driven by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   1997-1998, providing evidence of rapid adaptive management. The role of
   Fisheries Acts in defining access rights at the national level from a
   multilevel governance approach is discussed and further key elements
   that contributed to the transition towards sustainability are suggested.

Title = {Potential advantages in combining smart and green infrastructure over

Abstract = {Cities are incorporating smart and green infrastructure components in
   their urban design policies, adapting existing and new infrastructure
   systems to integrate technological advances to mitigate extreme weather
   due to climate change. Research has illustrated that smart green
   infrastructure (SGI) provides not only climate change resilience but
   also many health and wellbeing benefits that improve the quality of life
   of citizens. With the growing demand for smart technology, a series of
   problems and challenges, including governance, privacy, and security,
   must be addressed. This paper explores the potential to transition from
   grey, green, or smart silos to work with nature-based solutions and
   smart technology to help change cities to achieve considerable
   environmental and socio-economic benefits. The concepts of grey, green,
   and smart infrastructure are presented, and the needs, benefits, and
   applications are investigated. Moreover, the advantages of using
   integrated smart, green nature-based solutions are discussed. A
   comprehensive literature review is undertaken with keyword searches,
   including journal papers, stakeholder and case study reports, and local
   authority action plans. The methodology adopts multimethod qualitative
   information review, including literature, case studies, expert
   interviews, and documentary analysis. Published data and information are
   analysed to capture the key concepts in implementing SGI systems, such
   as storm-water control, flood and coastal defense, urban waste
   management, transportation, recreation, and asset management. The paper
   investigates the elimination of silo approaches and the alleviation of
   the destructions caused by extreme weather events using these
   interdependent SGI systems supported by novel data-driven platforms to
   provide nature-based solutions to boost the health and wellbeing of the
   residents.},

Title = {Increased frequency of extreme rainfall events threatens an emblematic
   cultural coastal agroecosystem in Southeastern Thailand},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal agricultural systems in Southeast Asia are vulnerable to climate
   change. The combination of rising sea levels and extreme rainfall events
   is eroding fragile coastlines that protect emblematic ``rice bowls{''}
   across the region. A series of recent damaging floods in Southeastern
   Thailand has raised concerns about their increased frequency. Local and
   regional trends in rainfall variables relevant to farming were
   investigated using the resampling-based Mann-Kendall test applied to
   four rainfall stations of the Songkhla lagoon basin during the period
   1957-2019. Using the findings from long-term and multi-scale agrarian
   change surveys based on Mazoyer and Roudard's methodology, a
   vulnerability framework was used to assess the sensitivity and response
   capacity to these trends of the great Songkhla spit agroecosystem.
   Significant positive trends in the rainfall depth, number of rainy days,
   and maximum daily rainfall were observed in January at individual
   stations and across the region, especially since the early 1980s.
   Moreover, the annual frequency of extreme rainfall events consistently
   increased over the same period. The impacts on the unstable coastal main
   sandbar that protects the flood plain are discussed, while the effects
   on rice production are analyzed. The coping responses of the cultural
   rice and sugar palm-based agroforestry system, and the lack of
   adaptation of recent land-use changes are examined. The agro-ecological,
   economic, and social importance of the dense hedges of sugar palms to
   mitigate climatic risks and maintain the resilience of local livelihood
   systems is underlined. Propositions for short and longer-term measures
   to adapt water management, diversify cropping systems, and foster
   participatory disaster risk management are made.},

Title = {A quasi-experimental approach for evaluating the heat mitigation effects
   of roofs in Illinois},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the coming decades, millions of urban residents will be exposed to
   increasingly deadly heat extremes. As an adaptive response to rising
   temperatures, many cities have begun to install vegetated ``green{''}
   roofs, which now vary widely in structure and size, and have generally
   been shown to have cooling capacity. Yet, little research has been done
   to differentiate which types of green roofs are most effective at
   reducing urban heat. We present a method to evaluate the cooling effects
   associated with green infrastructure that draws on publicly available
   satellite imagery and open-source software for analysis. Based on a
   quasi-experimental research design that integrates social and physical
   science approaches, this technique is able to identify the cooling
   effects of green infrastructure against background warming trends
   associated with urbanization and climate change. We demonstrate this
   method at three green roof sites across the City of Chicago, finding
   that the study sites with larger, intensive green roofs accompanied by
   diverse plant species have greater cooling benefits than the extensive,
   monoculture green roof. Our low-cost method can aid policymakers and
   planners in empirically evaluating the cooling capacity of green roofs
   in their own communities.},

Title = {Anthropogenic Influences on 2019 July Precipitation Extremes Over the
   Mid-Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Understanding the driving factors for precipitation extremes matters for
   adaptation and mitigation measures against the changing
   hydrometeorological hazards in Yangtze River basin, a habitable area
   that provides water resources for domestic, farming, and industrial
   needs. However, the region is naturally subject to major floods linked
   to monsoonal heavy precipitation during May-September. This study aims
   to quantify anthropogenic influences on the changing risk of 2-week-long
   precipitation extremes such as the July 2019 extreme cases, as well as
   events of shorter durations, over the middle and lower reaches of
   Yangtze River basin (MLYRB). Precipitation extremes with different
   durations ranging from 1-day to 14-days maximum precipitation
   accumulations are investigated. Gridded daily precipitations based on
   nearly 2,400 meteorological stations across China are used to define
   maximum accumulated precipitation extremes over the MLYRB in July during
   1961-2019. Attribution analysis is conducted by using the Met Office
   HadGEM3-GA6 modeling system, which comprises two sets of 525-member
   ensembles for 2019. One is forced with observed sea-surface temperatures
   (SSTs), sea-ice and all forcings, and the other is forced with
   preindustrialized SSTs and natural forcings only. The risk ratio between
   the exceedance probabilities estimated from all-forcing and
   natural-forcing simulations is calculated to quantify the anthropogenic
   contribution to the changing risks of the July 2019-like precipitation
   extremes. The results reveal that anthropogenic warming has reduced the
   likelihood of 2019-like 14-days heavy precipitation over the mid-lower
   reaches of the Yangtze River by 20\%, but increased that of 2-days
   extremes by 30\%.},

Title = {An assessment of systems, agents, and institutions in building community
   resilience to climate change: A case study of Charlottetown, Canada},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While climate change manifests itself as a global phenomenon, impacts
   are experienced most acutely at the local scale. As a result, the onus
   of responding to climate change impacts through planning policies and
   practice falls on local government decision-makers. This qualitative
   study, based in Charlottetown, Canada, utilizes the framework of
   resilience theory to examine the relationship between systems, agents,
   and institutions in addressing climate vulnerability to build community
   resilience. Findings suggest that while non-municipal agents such as
   senior orders of government and external organizations are championing
   proactive adaptation through climate impact research and adaptation
   initiatives, the municipality has taken a non-urgent, reactionary
   approach in the face of climate stressors, often implementing
   initiatives that further exacerbate climate vulnerability. In the face
   of system vulnerabilities and cascading failures, deep institutional
   barriers, influencing and influenced by agents, contribute to the low
   prioritization of climate adaptation action. Institutional and
   agent-induced constraints at the municipal scale have led to the lack of
   internal initiative to act within the municipality, undermining the
   efforts of external organizations and senior orders of government. This
   study highlights the importance of robust local government agents and
   institutions as a prerequisite to enable local-scale climate adaptation.},

Title = {Marine protected areas overall success evaluation (MOSE): A novel
   integrated framework for assessing management performance and
   social-ecological benefits of MPAs},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {198},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Characterized by interlinked social, economic, and ecological dynamics,
   Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a management tool for achieving
   sustainability goals in social-ecological systems. The recent increase
   in their establishment worldwide, fostered by international policies,
   highlights the need for comprehensive and integrated assessment
   frameworks able to address the evaluation of their social-ecological
   effectiveness and management performance, which is of fundamental
   importance for their adaptive management and decision making processes.
   Although several indicators and methodologies exist to assess MPAs
   ecological or social performances, no comprehensive assessment framework
   currently captures their broad range of objectives, encompassing the
   ecological, socio-cultural, and economic spheres. In this study, we
   present a novel quantitative framework (named MPAs Overall Success
   Evaluation - MOSE) able to assess the overall effectiveness and
   management performance of MPAs under the perspective of
   social-ecological systems. The multicriteria framework includes
   indicators linked to nature conservation, socio-cultural,
   socio-economic, and management objectives, integrating the
   multidisciplinary knowledge on MPAs in a single but comprehensive
   approach. The proposed framework was applied to the case study of
   Cerbere-Banyuls Natural Marine Reserve (France), the first MPA included
   in the IUCN Green List. Results showed that a high level of management
   effort is applied to the investigated MPA, generating several
   social-ecological benefits. This study showed the applicability of the
   MOSE framework and its potential usefulness as a tool to inform managers
   and decision-makers in charge for developing adaptive management
   strategies.},

Title = {High albedo materials to counteract heat waves in cities: An assessment
   of meteorology, buildings energy needs and pedestrian thermal comfort},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {163},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climatological data show that the frequency of Heat Waves (HWs) has
   increased since the 1950s and that it will continue to increase. These
   phenomena exasperate the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. In this
   study, we investigated the impact of a HW on the UHI in Milan (Italy);
   we also analyzed the effects of the application of high albedo materials
   on the vertical and horizontal urban built surfaces. We performed
   numerical experiments with the Weather Research and Forecasting model,
   whose output were used as input for the EnergyPlus software and the
   computation of the Mediterranean Outdoor Comfort Index (MOCI). Our
   results showed that the HW induces a maximum increase of about 4 degrees
   C in the temperature at 2 m height and that the use of high albedo
   materials covering all urban surfaces only partially counteracts this
   increase. The wind speed decreases due to the HW and the introduction of
   high albedo materials leads to its further decrease. The cooling energy
   consumption for a building located in the city doubles in the presence
   of HW and high albedo materials have a negligible positive effect when
   applied to the surrounding urban environment. The HW brings an increase
   up to about 0.7 of the MOCI and the use of high albedo materials further
   worsens thermal sensation. Therefore, this mitigation strategy leads to
   considerable benefits in terms of temperature and energy, while it
   determines a penalization of the well-being of the pedestrian. Its
   application requires a careful evaluation of benefits and side effects.},

Title = {Effect of using different methods in the construction of climate change
   scenarios: Examples from Europe},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {To investigate the impacts of future climate change on agriculture in
   Europe and to aid the development of agricultural adaptation strategies,
   several scenarios of climate change were constructed and provided as
   input to crop-climate models at both broad and site-specific scales.
   These scenarios were based on results from a number of global climate
   model (GCM) experiments, including both equilibrium and transient
   climate change experiments. All GCMs provide `internally consistent'
   scenarios of climate change, but at coarse horizontal spatial
   resolutions. Results from equilibrium experiments give no indication of
   the rate of climate change, whereas transient experiments simulate
   time-dependent climate change. Broad-scale climate change scenarios for
   Europe were constructed at 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude resolution
   using a Gaussian space-filtering routine. Site-specific scenarios at the
   daily timescale required by crop-growth simulation models were
   constructed using a stochastic weather generator in conjunction with
   GCM-derived information about possible future climate change. A
   regression technique to downscale broad-scale changes in temperature and
   precipitation means to specific sites was carried out at 2 European
   sites, Rothamsted, UK, and Seville, Spain. At other European sites,
   where crop-climate models were being run, the GCM-derived grid-box
   changes were used without downscaling. Use of a weather generator also
   enabled GCM-derived changes in climate variability to be incorporated
   into the scenarios by using the grid-box changes in the means and
   variances of the climate variables to perturb the parameters of the
   stochastic weather generator directly. The implications of using these
   different methods of climate change scenario construction for the
   resulting scenarios are discussed.},

Title = {Geomorphology as an indicator of the biophysical vulnerability of
   estuaries to coastal and flood hazards in a changing climate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-144},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasing the need to characterise the vulnerability
   of coastal landscapes to coastal and flood hazards that result in
   erosion and inundation. Indices, such as the Coastal Vulnerability Index
   (CVI), have emerged as useful tools with which coastal managers can
   prioritise areas for further detailed assessment of vulnerability, risk,
   resilience and adaptation options. Approaches, such as the use of an
   index, efficiently characterise the vulnerability of linear,
   one-dimensional coastal features such as coastlines; however, they do
   not capture variability in coastal processes affecting more complex,
   non-linear features, such as estuaries, or interactive effects of
   coastal processes between linear (e.g. coastlines) and non-linear (e.g.
   estuaries) landforms. We present an approach that uses geomorphology to
   indicate biophysical vulnerability of estuaries to coastal and flood
   hazards. The approach is applied to the South Coast of NSW; a
   wave-dominated coastline of approximately 400 km length that contains
   more than 100 estuaries. We demonstrate the simplicity of the approach
   and its utility in identifying areas requiring higher resolution
   assessments. Although this approach does not include socio-economic
   factors, we demonstrate the capacity to incorporate socio-economic
   components of vulnerability using regional land use mapping. We infer
   that the most vulnerable estuaries are characterised by large catchment
   areas, broad estuarine valleys, mature stages of infill, or entrances
   oriented towards the prevailing wave direction. The area below 15 m
   elevation was identified as a robust indicator of the total area of
   vulnerability within a catchment. This approach can be applied to
   one-dimensional and more complex two-dimensional landscapes, such as
   estuaries; integrates varying sea-level rise projections; and
   incorporates a wider range of hazards that operate in the coastal zone.},

Title = {Likelihood of climate change pathways under uncertainty on fossil fuel
   resource availability},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2482-2496},
Abstract = {Uncertainties concerning fossil fuel resource availability have
   traditionally been deemphasized in climate change research as global
   baseline emission scenarios (i.e., scenarios that do not consider
   additional climate policies) have been built on the assumption of
   abundant fossil fuel resources for the 21st century. However, current
   estimates are subject to critical uncertainties and an emerging body of
   literature is providing revised estimates. Here we consider the entire
   range of revised estimates, applying an integrated assessment model to
   perform a likelihood analysis of climate change pathways. Our results
   show that, by the end of the century, the two highest emission pathways
   from the IPCC, the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP6 and
   RCP8.5, where the baseline scenarios currently lie, have probabilities
   of being surpassed of 42\% and 12\%, respectively. In terms of
   temperature change, the probability of exceeding the 2 degrees C level
   by 2100 remains very high (88\%), confirming the need for urgent climate
   action. Coal resource uncertainty determines the uncertainty about the
   emission and radiative forcing pathways due to the poor quality of data.
   We also find that the depletion of fossil fuels is likely to occur
   during the second half of the century accelerating the transition to
   renewable energy sources in baseline scenarios. Accordingly, more
   investments may be required to enable the energy transition, while the
   additional mitigation measures would in turn necessitate a lower effort
   than currently estimated. Hence, the integrated analysis of resource
   availability and climate change is essential to obtain internally
   consistent climate pathways.},

Journal = {PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The cities in Southeast Asian and Small Island Developing States have
   distorted the natural environment by haphazardly constructing roads,
   buildings, and other infrastructures. Such massive changes in the
   environment are altering the ecology, creating sustainable development
   challenges such as climate-related extreme weather events. Super Typhoon
   Haiyan devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the
   Philippines, on November 8, 2013, that caused physical and psychological
   illnesses to the affected. To prevent these impacts and make cities
   sustainably develop and Climate Change (CC) resilient, a Science and
   Policy Framework (SPF) piloting Quezon City Local Government (QCLG) is
   developed. The application of SPF revealed, among others, the QCLG
   institutional and personnel adaptive capacities, threat level of
   CC-related hazards on development growth sectors and institutional and
   personnel relative vulnerabilities. These findings allowed QCLG to
   develop sectoral Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP) 2017-2027 to
   mainstream CC Adaptation (CCA) at the very early stages of development
   planning. The SPF and LCCAP are flexible and fashioned toward enhancing
   key development sectors in creating sustainable and CCA-resilient
   Cities. They can be globally-effective tools for achieving the Paris
   Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals, and targets of the Sendai
   Framework.},

Abstract = {Artificial island development (AID) to tackle rampant urbanization on
   scarce land puts all marine biodiversity at huge risk and is recognized
   as a global conservation issue worldwide. This study critically reviews
   the gaps that undermined biodiversity and ecology during construction
   activities of the artificial islands in the Gulf region that could be
   alleviated if apposite environmental values and sustainable strategies
   of different regions of the world had paid enough heed to economic and
   social aspects. The method used for this study was an analytical
   descriptive literature survey, and the resources were chosen after three
   phases of quality assessment. This survey found various barricades to
   sustainable AID, such as lack of scientific data, adequate site
   selection, ineffective environmental evaluations, noncompliance with
   legislation, and economic gains over the environmental aspects. It was
   concluded that to protect the marine ecosystem from inevitable
   degradation, strict compliance with international and national
   legislation, research and baseline data collection, strengthening of the
   existing environmental assessment, continuous capacity building, and
   modern practices of different countries should be brought to the
   forefront. Furthermore, this study aims to provide guidance to
   policymakers and governmental organizations to mitigate emerging
   environmental issues during AID through strategic decision-making
   processes.},

Abstract = {Climate change is not being felt equally around the world. Regions where
   warming is most rapid will be among those to experience impacts first,
   will need to develop early responses to these impacts and can provide a
   guide for management elsewhere. We describe the research history in one
   such global marine hotspot-south-east Australia-where a number of
   contentions about the value of hotspots as natural laboratories have
   been supported, including (1) early reporting of changes (2) early
   documentation of impacts, and (3) earlier development and promotion of
   adaptation options. We illustrate a transition from single discipline
   impacts-focused research to an inter-disciplinary systems view of
   adaptation research. This transition occurred against a background of
   change in the political position around climate change and was
   facilitated by four preconditioning factors. These were: (1) early
   observations of rapid oceanic change that coincided with (2) biological
   change which together provided a focus for action, (3) the strong marine
   orientation and history of management in the region, and (4) the
   presence of well developed networks. Three case studies collectively
   show the critical role of inter-disciplinary engagement and stakeholder
   participation in supporting industry and government adaptation planning.},

Title = {Are world fisheries a global panarchy?},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {165-170},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Problems of overfishing and other stresses to fish populations have
   continued to grow in scale, from smaller to more global pressures. These
   pressures are found in changes in the water column, such as through
   warming, as well as pollution and fishing effort and practices. Single
   stock collapses have been common, and pressures are building across
   marine regions. This paper questions whether or not it makes sense from
   a policy perspective to think of fisheries as a hierarchical global
   integrated adaptive system, or panarchy. From a policy perspective rules
   and institutional procedure, actors, and ecosystem dynamics all provide
   a foundation for many fishery stresses, and casting policy at the wrong
   scale can provide problems of institutional fitness, as well as set
   fishing and fishery based social-economic systems up for unexpected
   crisis. If it makes sense to think of global fisheries as a panarchy, it
   is plausible that fisheries can collapse at this scale, and policy
   makers around the world should use measures to build resilience at this
   level, primarily through reducing slow persistent disturbances while
   preparing for surprises. This review concludes that certainly fisheries
   can be viewed at the global scale and a planetary mindset should be
   included in international fishery policy making that should assert the
   value of an interconnected ocean and planet beyond simple fish
   commodities. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Title = {Extreme drought hotspot analysis for adaptation to a changing climate:
   Assessment of applicability to the five major river basins of the Korean

Abstract = {This study proposes a quantitative approach for extreme drought hotspot
   assessment related to climate change, the hotspot drought risk index
   (HDRI), and evaluates the response of extreme drought to climate change
   in the five major river basins of the Korean Peninsula. According to an
   analysis of seasonal and regional drought characteristics on the Korean
   Peninsula, drought occurs most frequently in spring, and the central and
   southern areas are generally more vulnerable to drought. Drought risk
   analysis under various climate change scenarios indicates significant
   drought risk over the entire Korean Peninsula excepting some parts of
   the Han and Nakdong river basins from 2011 to 2040. Extreme drought may
   be particularly severe in the mid-west area as these basins lack
   available water resources. Drought risk decreases in the southern Korean
   Peninsula in the 2011-2040 and 2071-2099 periods, during which the area
   vulnerable to drought also decreases. However, some parts of central
   Korea and the western and eastern coastlines remain susceptible to
   drought. The drought risk evaluation method suggested herein may be
   useful for predicting drought and establishing realistic coping
   strategies for extreme drought in a changing climate.},

Abstract = {City strategic plans and enabling policies provide a framework for and
   inform future development across multiple scales. An exemplar city
   strategic plan will be one based on evidence, enabled by complementary
   policy outcomes, and built on the knowledge of the existing landscape.
   This study evaluated the plan quality of eighteen metropolitan strategic
   plans for city members in the 100 Resilient Cities initiative. A
   protocol was developed containing thirty-two indicators to assess plans
   capacity to act as a strategic planning tool to develop, analyse and
   implement strategies for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and climate change
   mitigation and adaptation. The evaluation indicated that strategies
   addressing the UHI are rarely included in metropolitan plans. Strategic
   plans showed a lack of evidence-base to inform the potential actions.
   Urban warming is often linked to extreme weather events anticipated
   under climate change, not the UHI as a systemic and increasing
   phenomenon. We recommend that the pathway to addressing UHI mitigation
   and adaptation may lie in its nexus to aspects of climate change that
   concurrently can serve to support liveable and resilient cities.},

   significant issues in the Waimakariri catchment of the South Island of
   New Zealand: availability of water for irrigation, public water supply
   for Christchurch urban area, and gravel extraction from the bed of the
   Waimakariri River. Different spatial scales were determined for
   sustainability analysis. Using the adaptive cycle of exploitation,
   accumulation, disturbance/release and reorganisation, critical variables
   for maintaining the resilience of each system and the thresholds for
   management interventions to achieve sustainable systems were identified.
   Also crucial for sustainability was the maintenance of the linkages
   between the different spatial scales.},

Abstract = {The construction of a new generation of coastal power stations in the UK
   and other western European countries has highlighted the absence of
   robust standards for thermal discharges to transitional and coastal
   waters. The proposed discharge volumes are greater than hitherto, yet
   there has been little independent critical examination of their
   potential impact, whilst much of the existing guidance has been adapted
   from freshwater practice. This review considers the available knowledge
   on the tolerance and behaviour of fish and other marine biota to heated
   effluents. Appropriate ways are suggested of grouping fish species to
   reflect their sensitivity to thermal effects. The plethora of existing
   standards are considered and their validity assessed in a framework of
   predicted seawater temperature rise. Those species or groups of
   organisms most likely to be affected are identified and finally specific
   recommendations for thermal standards consistent with long term
   sustainability are proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon populations have declined in recent decades. Many of the
   threats to the species during its freshwater and coastal residency
   periods are known, and management approaches are available to mitigate
   them. The global scale of climate change and altered ocean ecosystems
   make these threats more difficult to address. Managers need to be aware
   that promoting strong, healthy, and resilient wild populations migrating
   from rivers is the optimal approach currently to reduce the impacts of
   changing ecosystems and low marine survival. We argue that a fundamental
   strategy should be to ensure that the highest number of wild smolts in
   the best condition leave from rivers and coastal areas to the ocean.
   There is great scope for water quality, river regulation, migration
   barriers, and physical river habitat improvements. Maintenance of
   genetic integrity and diversity of wild populations by eliminating
   interbreeding with escaped farmed salmon, eliminating poorly planned
   stocking, and reducing impacts that reduce population sizes to
   dangerously low levels will support the ability of Atlantic salmon to
   adapt to changing environments. Reducing the impacts from aquaculture
   and other human activities in coastal areas can greatly increase marine
   survival in affected areas. As most of the threats to wild salmon are
   the result of human activities, a focus on human dimensions and improved
   communication, from scientific and management perspectives, needs to be
   increasingly emphasized. When political and social will are coupled with
   adequate resources, managers often have the tools to mitigate many of
   the threats to wild salmon.},

Title = {Impact of reflective materials on urban canyon albedo, outdoor and

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The urban canyon albedo (UCA) quantifies the ability of street canyons
   to reflect solar radiation back to the sky. The UCA is controlled by the
   solar reflectance of road and facades and the street geometry. This
   study investigates the variability of UCA in a typical residential area
   of London and its impact on outdoor and indoor microclimates. The
   results are based on radiation measurements in real urban canyons and on
   a 1:10 physical model and simulations using ENVImet v 4.4.6 and
   EnergyPlus. Different scenarios with increased solar reflectance of
   roads and facades were simulated to investigate the impact on UCA and
   street level microclimate. The results showed that increasing the road
   reflectance has high absolute and relative impact on UCA in wide
   canyons. In deeper canyons, the absolute impact of the road reflectance
   is reduced while the relative impact of the walls' reflectance is
   increased. Results also showed that increasing surface reflectance in
   urban canyons has a detrimental impact on outdoor thermal comfort, due
   to increased interreflections between surfaces leading to higher mean
   radiant temperatures. Increasing the road reflectance also increases the
   incident diffuse radiation on adjacent buildings, producing a small
   increase in indoor operative temperatures. The findings were used to
   discuss the best design strategies to improve the urban thermal
   environment by using reflective materials in urban canyons without
   compromising outdoor thermal comfort or indoor thermal environments.},

Abstract = {Most Chinese metropolitan regions have experienced rapid urbanization.
   Cities lying in coastal areas are prone to severe weather events. The
   meteorological hazards expose greater numbers of developed areas a

   characterize how urbanization process, as well as monsoon climatic
   oscillations, affects Shanghai's vulnerability to severe weather
   conditions. To assess how regional urbanization may impact vulnerability
   to droughts and floods, an analysis examining potential rhythmic
   variations was implemented. Our results indicated that the centennial
   scale metrological droughts and floods were a function of monsoon
   climate, while the decadal metrological oscillations in recent one and
   half centuries were primarily modified by the anthropogenic behaviors
   and resulting hydrologic characteristics. In view of the wide
   distribution, the meteorological droughts and floods are key issues for
   long-term social-economic harmonization in Shanghai. This study can
   assist in prioritizing disaster mitigation measures and ensuring
   regional sustainable development in the study area.},

Abstract = {Integrated Shoreline Management Plan (ISMP) is a planning framework and
   tool developed to achieve sustainable coastal development based on up to
   date knowledge of the coastal environment and best development
   practices. Realizing the increasing trends of coastal erosion and
   conflicts, the Government of Malaysia through the Department of
   Irrigation of Drainage (DID) has planned the ISMPs for every state in
   Malaysia, with the main objective of providing guidelines on
   implementing sustainable coastal development while providing adaptation
   strategies to minimize the associated risks. The plan focuses on the
   evaluation of physical, environmental, and socio-economic aspects on top
   of extensive stakeholder consultations to provide coastal planning
   alternatives that fulfil the respective state requirements. As part of
   this plan, Decision Support Systems are introduced to allow the
   dissemination of the collected data, plan strategies and recommendations
   to the different stakeholders in order to achieve a consistent
   development evaluated by different government agencies and private
   sectors. This paper will discuss on the application of the ISMP's in
   Malaysia focusing on the ISMP State of Perlis, Malaysia, with a
   discussion on its benefits and challenges as well as examples of coastal
   adaptation.},

Title = {Using boundary objects to stimulate transformational thinking: storm

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Like many coastal ports around the world, Rhode Island's Port of
   Providence in USA is at risk for climate-related natural hazards, such
   as catastrophic storm surges and significant sea level rise (0.5-2.0 m),
   over the next century. To combat such events, communities may eventually
   adopt so-called ``transformational adaptation'' strategies, like the
   construction of major new infrastructure, the reorganization of
   vulnerable systems, or changes in their locations. Such strategies can
   take decades or more to plan, design, find consensus around, fund, and
   ultimately implement. Before any meaningful decisions can be made,
   however, a shared understanding of risks, consequences, and options must
   be generated and allowed to percolate through the decision-making
   systems. This paper presents results from a pre-planning exercise that
   utilized ``boundary objects'' to engage the Port of Providence's
   stakeholders in an early dialogue about the transformational approaches
   to hazard-risk mitigation. The research team piloted the following three
   boundary objects as a means to initiate meaningful dialogue about
   long-term storm resilience challenges amongst key stakeholders of this
   exposed seaport system: (1) a storm scenario with local-scale
   visualizations, (2) three long-term transformational resilience
   concepts, and (3) a decision support tool called Wecision. The team
   tested these boundary objects in a workshop setting with 30 port
   business owners and policy makers, and found them to be an effective
   catalyst to generate a robust dialogue around a very challenging topic.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Pages = {967-979},

Abstract = {By 2009, the Kien Giang coast, Vietnam, had experienced significant
   coastal erosion and mangrove degradation. Recent mitigation strategies,
   developed through policies, plans and mangrove planting programs have
   not been successful, in part because the causes of coastal erosion were
   not adequately identified. This paper investigates the relationship
   between human activities and coastal erosion in Kien Giang province.
   This study used mixed methods to understand the causes of coastal
   erosion with an emphasis on human activities. In this investigation,
   local communities were involved as co-investigators to explore the
   causes of coastal erosion in Kien Giang province. While natural factors
   (adverse effects of climate change and sea level rise) have been widely
   reported as main causes of coastal erosion, human activities initially
   were not recognised by local communities as significant contributors to
   coastal erosion and mangrove degradation. Human activities such as poor
   aquaculture pond construction, poor construction of new and upgraded
   sections of the sea dyke system, mangrove afforestation using only a
   single species, mangrove cutting for commercial and domestic uses, and
   construction of local boating channels, and the interaction of
   anthropogenic activities and physical processes are significant
   contributors to erosion. The study resulted in the awareness of the
   impact of community activities on the coast being improved. Knowledge
   gaps and necessary policy changes are identified.},

   in Central Asia},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {599},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the current changes and dynamics of different types of
   vegetation in relation to climatic changes and anthropogenic activities
   is critical for developing adaptation strategies to address the
   challenges posed by climate change and human activities for ecosystems.
   Based on a regression analysis and the Hurst exponent index method, this
   research investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics and
   relationships between vegetation greenness and climatic factors in
   Central Asia using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
   gridded high-resolution station (land) data for the period 1984-2013.
   Further analysis distinguished between the effects of climatic change
   and those of human activities on vegetation dynamics by means of a
   residual analysis trend method. The results show that vegetation pixels
   significantly decreased for shrubs and sparse vegetation compared with
   those for the other vegetation types and that the degradation of sparse
   vegetation was more serious in the Karakum and Kyzylkum Deserts, the
   Ustyurt Plateau and the wetland delta of the Large Aral Sea than in
   other regions. The Hurst exponent results indicated that forests are
   more sustainable than grasslands, shrubs and sparse vegetation.
   Precipitation is the main factor affecting vegetation growth in the
   Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik. Moreover, temperature is a controlling factor
   that influences the seasonal variation of vegetation greenness in the
   mountains and the Aral Sea basin. Drought is the main factor affecting
   vegetation degradation as a result of both increased temperature and
   decreased precipitation in the Kyzylkum Desert and the northern Ustyurt
   Plateau. The residual analysis highlighted that sparse vegetation and
   the degradation of some shrubs in the southern part of the Karakum
   Desert, the southern Ustyurt Plateau and the wetland delta of the Large
   Aral Sea were mainly triggered by human activities: the excessive
   exploitation of water resources in the upstream areas of the Amu Darya
   basin and oil and natural gas extraction in the southern part of the
   Karakum Desert and the southern Ustyurt Plateau. The results also
   indicated that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, abandoned
   pastures gave rise to increased vegetation in eastern Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and abandoned croplands reverted to
   grasslands in northern Kazakhstan, leading to a decrease in cropland
   greenness. Shrubs and sparse vegetation were extremely sensitive to
   short-term climatic variations, and our results demonstrated that these
   vegetation types were the most seriously degraded by human activities.
   Therefore, regional governments should strive to restore vegetation to
   sustain this fragile arid ecological environment (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Future maps and visualizations of sea level rise struggle to convey the
   salience of evolving coastal hazards on the ground. This study engaged
   three Norfolk, Virginia communities in the ``Blue Line{''} project to
   identify the appealing components of various types of visualizations and
   determine which images increase risk perceptions, contribute to the
   selection of adaptation or mitigation strategies, and elicit protective
   actions. Participants viewed models of future high tide shorelines for
   2050, 2080, and 2100 as digitized maps and photographs of the lines
   marked on the ground with tape, spray chalk, and flags at three
   different communities: a residential neighborhood and park; a downtown
   museum and open space; and a working waterfront. Results indicate that
   while the combination of maps and photographs were preferred for the
   realism conveyed, maps were better able to show a larger area and
   photographs were more personal. Photographs balanced the reactions to
   maps, which were preferred, and increased the perception of sea level
   rise, but also elicited built solutions. Citizens expressed greater
   immediacy for action in residential areas even if the perceived risk was
   higher in heritage areas. These results can inform the balance of
   visualization types utilized by planners and community organizations to
   create a comprehensive plan through participatory processes.},

Abstract = {In 2005, the Government of the Province of Quebec, Canada, adopted the
   Climate Change Action Plan for 2006 - 2012. The Institut national de
   sante publique du Quebec (National Institute of Public Health of
   Quebec), charged with implementing the health adaptation component of
   the Plan, worked to mitigate urban heat islands (UHI) by funding and
   evaluating 40 pilot projects. These projects explored different methods
   of fighting UHIs by greening cities in a participative and mobilizing
   approach led mainly by non-governmental organizations and
   municipalities. An assessment of temperatures before and after
   implementing various methods demonstrated that some actions enabled
   significant gains of coolness and more efficiently mitigated heat
   (reduction of concrete/asphalt surfaces, increasing vegetation, etc.).
   An assessment of quality of life showed that projects were positively
   received by users, especially by those living in vulnerable situations.
   A lifecycle analysis showed that from the environmental perspective, UHI
   mitigation measures that do not require fertilization or maintenance are
   preferable. Finally, communication efforts that raise awareness of UHI
   and mitigation are of significant importance to program success.},

Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Plant leaf morphological and photosynthetic physiological
   characteristics are key functional traits in the adaptability of plants
   to heterogeneous environments. Analysis of the correlation between leaf
   morphological traits and photosynthetic physiological characteristics of
   salt marsh plants is helpful to deepen our understanding of how salt
   marsh plants adjust their leaf structure and function to adapt to their
   environment. However, there have been few studies on the relationship
   between leaf morphology and photosynthetic physiological characteristics
   of plants in inland salt marshes under a habitat gradient. A Phragmites
   australis community was divided into three plots based on differences in
   the wetland habitat conditions: a remote water area (plot I, 400-550 m
   from the water margin), a middle water area (plot II, 200-350 m from the
   water margin) and a near water area (plot III, 0-150 m from the water
   margin). The relationship between leaf morphological traits and
   photosynthetic physiological parameters of P. australis in heterogeneous
   habitats was studied. The results showed that as the habitat conditions
   changed from plot I to plot III, the soil characteristics, above-ground
   characteristics of the community and the photosynthetically active
   radiation changed significantly (P < 0.05). Besides, there was a highly
   significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) between leaf dry weight
   (LDW) and net photosynthetic rate (P-n), the effective quantum yield of
   PSII photochemistry (Y(II), actual photochemical efficiency of PSII) and
   photochemical quenching (QP); and between leaf area and P-n, Y(II) and
   QP in the three habitats. Moreover, in plot I, P. australis tended to
   have small and thick leaves with a low LDW and specific leaf area. In
   plot III, leaves were large and thin to adapt to the change in habitat
   conditions. This study provides a scientific theoretical basis for
   understanding the ecological adaptation strategies of plants in the
   harsh environment of an inland salt marsh and the conservation and
   management of wetland plants.
   Plant leaf morphological and photosynthetic physiological
   characteristics are key functional traits in the adaptability of plants
   to heterogeneous environments. Our results showed that in the far water
   area of a salt marsh, Phragmites australisplants tended to have small
   and thick leaves. In the near water area, the reed population had large
   and thin leaves to adapt to the change in habitat conditions. Moreover,
   we found that leaf morphological characteristics of P. australiswere
   closely related to photosynthesis. This study provides a scientific
   theoretical basis for understanding the ecological adaptation strategies

Abstract = {Efforts are accelerating to protect and restore ecosystems globally.
   With trillions of dollars in ecosystem services at stake, no clear
   framework exists for developing or prioritizing approaches to restore
   coral reefs even as efforts and investment opportunities to do so grow
   worldwide. Restoration may buy time for climate change mitigation, but
   it lacks rigorous guidance to meet objectives of scalability and
   effectiveness. Lessons from restoration of terrestrial ecosystems can
   and should be rapidly adopted for coral reef restoration. We propose how
   the 10 golden rules of effective forest restoration can be translated to
   accelerate efforts to restore coral reefs based on established
   principles of resilience, management, and local stewardship. We
   summarize steps to undertake reef restoration as a management strategy
   in the context of the diverse ecosystem service values that coral reefs
   provide. Outlining a clear blueprint is timely as more stakeholders seek
   to undertake restoration as the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration

Abstract = {Coastal districts of India being diverse in nature are under constant
   vulnerability to hazards. The article analyzes vulnerability as a
   function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptation capacity. We selected
   site-specific factors of exposure, sensitivity and adaptation for
   constructing the composite vulnerability index. Findings revealed very
   high and high vulnerability in the eastern coastal districts while
   western coastal districts experienced moderate and low vulnerability.
   High frequency of cyclone and storm surge, low socio-economic status and
   lack of basic amenities and facilities were found significant stressors
   for increasing vulnerability in coastal districts. Composite
   vulnerability index not only helped in analyzing causative factors of
   vulnerability but also proved to be an effective tool in identifying
   priority districts where efforts could be made to lessen vulnerability.
   The study calls for policy measures to reduce vulnerability and
   safeguard the coastal communities from the risk of disasters.},

Title = {Environmental change: prospects for conservation and agriculture in a
   southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Accelerating environmental change is perhaps the greatest challenge for
   natural resource management; successful strategies need to be effective
   for decades to come. Our objective is to identify opportunities that new
   environmental conditions may provide for conservation, restoration, and
   resource use in a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot in
   southwestern Australia. We describe a variety of changes to key
   taxonomic groups and system-scale characteristics as a consequence of
   environmental change (climate and land use), and outline strategies for
   conserving and restoring important ecological and agricultural
   characteristics. Opportunities for conservation and economic adaptation
   are substantial because of gradients in rainfall, temperature, and land
   use, extensive areas of remnant native vegetation, the ability to reduce
   and ameliorate areas affected by secondary salinization, and the
   existence of large national parks and an extensive network of nature
   reserves. Opportunities presented by the predicted environmental changes
   encompass agricultural as well as natural ecosystems. These may include
   expansion of aquaculture, transformation of agricultural systems to
   adapt to drier autumns and winters, and potential increases in spring
   and summer rain, carbon-offset plantings, and improving the network of
   conservation reserves. A central management dilemma is whether
   restoration/preservation efforts should have a commercial or
   biodiversity focus, and how they could be integrated. Although the grand
   challenge is conserving, protecting, restoring, and managing for a
   future environment, one that balances economic, social, and
   environmental values, the ultimate goal is to establish a regional
   culture that values the unique regional environment and balances the
   utilization of natural resources against protecting remaining natural
   ecosystems.},

Title = {A three dimensional, full life cycle, anchovy and sardine model for the

Abstract = {We present the development of a 3D full-lifecycle, individual-based
   model (IBM) for anchovy and sardine, online coupled with an existing
   hydrodynamic/biogeochemical low-trophic level (LTL) model for the North
   Aegean Sea. This IBM was built on an existing 1D model for the same
   species and area, with the addition of a horizontal movement scheme. In
   the model, both species evolve from the embryonic stage (egg+yolk sac
   larva) to the larval, juvenile, and adult stages. Somatic growth is
   simulated with the use of a ``Wisconsin{''} type bioenergetics model and
   fish populations are computed considering reproduction and mortality
   (nat-ural, fishing, starvation), along with an adaptation of the `super
   individuals' (SI) approach. The 2000-2010 period was selected for the
   reference simulation and model calibration, in terms of fish growth and
   population biomass. The interannual biomass variabil-ity of anchovy was
   successfully represented by the model, while the simulated biomass of
   sardine exhibited low variability and did not satisfactorily reproduce
   the interannual variability observed in acoustic surveys. The spatial
   biomass distribution of both spe-cies was in relatively good agreement
   with field data. Additional single-species simulations revealed that
   species compete for food resources. Temperature sensitivity experiments
   showed that both species reacted negatively to a temperature increase.
   Anchovy, in particular, was more affected since its spawning and larval
   growth periods largely overlap with the period of maximum yearly
   temperature and low prey concentration. Finally, simulation experiments
   using IPCC climatic scenarios showed that the predicted temperature
   increase, and zooplankton concentration decrease will negatively affect
   anchovy, resulting in sardine prevalence.},

Abstract = {The transformation from natural to impervious surfaces in an
   urbanization process and the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is known
   to significantly compromise urban environmental quality and has been
   linked to climate change and associated impacts. Whereas the existence
   of UHI is common knowledge, the implication of urban land use land cover
   (LULC) gradient on intra-urban thermal characteristics is often poorly
   understood. A recent proliferation of remotely sensed datasets offer
   great potential in understanding the relationship between urban LULCs
   and their respective thermal characteristics, a critical basis for urban
   environmental management and designing climate change mitigation
   measures. This study explores the potential of multispectral remotely
   sensed dataset in determining the influence of rural/urban LULC gradient
   on urban thermal characteristics. A rectangular eleven band Landsat 8
   image subset was delineated from the central business district to the
   rural periphery and classified into most dominant LULCs and a
   corresponding Landsat 8 thermal layer used to determine the LULCs
   thermal characteristics. Digitized point data was used to determine
   differences in land surface temperature (LST) over gradient's LULC
   types. Results showed that there was varied contribution of LULCs to the
   LST. As expected, the density of built up surfaces and LST decreased
   towards the city's periphery while a decline in vegetation density from
   the periphery led to an increase in LST. These results provide valuable
   insights into the value of remotely sensed datasets in understanding the
   implication of intra-urban LULC gradient on LST characteristics.
   Specifically, the study demonstrates the value of remotely sensed data
   as aids to sustainable urban environmental planning.},

Abstract = {Scientists have long predicted large-scale responses of infectious
   diseases to climate change, giving rise to a polarizing debate,

   in some natural and agricultural systems, but in many cases, outcomes
   depend on the form of climate change and details of the host-pathogen
   system. In this review, we highlight research progress and gaps that
   have emerged during the past decade and develop a predictive framework
   that integrates knowledge from ecophysiology and community ecology with
   modeling approaches. Future work must continue to anticipate and monitor
   pathogen biodiversity and disease trends in natural ecosystems and

Title = {The Role of Hazard and Vulnerability in Modulating Economic Damages of
   Inland Floods in the United States Using a Survey-Based Dataset},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {This study investigates the trends in economic damages caused by three
   types of inland floods (flash flood, flood, and heavy rain) in the
   United States and the variations in related hazard and vulnerability
   indicators between 1996 and 2016. We explore the underlying mechanisms
   based on a survey-based dataset maintained by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service. An annual
   average of 6518 flood occurrences was reported, which caused economic
   damages of 3351 million USD per year. Flash flood and flood contributed
   to 53\% and 32\% of total occurrences and was associated with a larger
   share of damaging events (SDE). Results show that the higher impacts by
   flood and flash flood on property and crop are partly attributed to the
   greater intensity of rainfall. In addition, flood has the highest unit
   cost of damages. Notably, despite an upward tendency in economic damages
   by flash floods, no evident change trend is observed for inland floods
   as a whole. Further analysis shows changes in economic damages by heavy
   rain and flash flood are mainly governed by the increased annual
   frequency and hazard intensity, but the change of trend in their
   vulnerability indicators (i.e., SDE and Damage Per Event (DPE)) is not
   obvious. Regarding floods, it was not possible to attribute the
   variations in economic losses to hazard and vulnerability, as no
   significant tendency is found except for an increasing SDE. Despite
   limitations of length of records, data collection, and methodology, the
   difference in economic impacts and the related hazard and vulnerability
   revealed in this study can help better target future adaptation and
   mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Strong sustainability credentials are now considered an important aspect
   of any new urban development. However, actions to improve sustainability
   (described here as solutions) must not only perform under present
   conditions but must also continue to deliver their benefits however the
   future develops. This paper examines sustainability with respect to air
   quality (AQ) for a 6.6 ha case study in Lancaster, UK. The impacts of
   the proposed development on concentrations of the pollutants nitrogen
   dioxide, ozone and particulate matter and on air temperature are
   considered. The aspects of the development designed to enhance its
   sustainability for AQ, either explicitly or implicitly, include making
   the development permeable to non-motorised transport, providing new and
   appropriate bus routes, and minimising car parking space. Further
   important aspects of the design are highlighted, including tree
   planting, building form and albedo. The resilience of these solutions to
   future change is assessed using a scenarios-based futures analysis and
   the future resilience of many of the proposed solutions is shown to be
   uncertain. This is particularly the case for those solutions that rely
   on policy or maintenance to maintain their efficacy. The importance of
   developing cross-disciplinary sustainability solutions to enhance
   resilience is highlighted.},

Title = {Importance of Neighborhood Aspect Ratio and Storm Climate to Adaptation
   Efforts to Reduce Coastal Flood Mortality},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Low-lying Coastal Landfill Neighborhoods (CLaNs) often have a large
   aspect ratio, defined here as the coastline length divided by
   neighborhood width, due to the common practice of reclaiming fringing
   wetlands along tidal waterways. Flood risk reduction for CLaNs
   frequently involves elevated barriers, in the form of berms, seawalls,
   or levees, which reduce risk but cannot completely eliminate residual
   risk (e.g., due to overtopping during extreme events). Managed retreat
   is an alternative approach for flood risk reduction, the general idea of
   which is to strategically ban development in hazard zones, relocate
   structures, and/or abandon land. This study aims at exploring the
   tradeoffs between elevated barriers and managed retreat in terms of both
   CLaN aspect ratio and storm climate, for both short-term and long-term
   risk reduction with sea-level rise. Hydrodynamic flood modeling of an
   idealized CLaN protected by different adaptation plans is used to
   simulate flood conditions and mortality for a range of storm surge
   amplitudes for both the present-day and under different sea-level rise
   scenarios. Results show that for a berm and a case of managed retreat of
   an equal cost, retreat becomes more beneficial than the berm in terms of
   mortality risk reduction for neighborhoods with a larger aspect ratio.
   The study also shows that berms are generally less effective for
   reducing mortality in regions with less common but higher intensity
   storms. This study reveals the potential of idealized modeling to
   provide fundamental insights on the physical factors influencing the
   efficacy of different adaptation strategies for mortality risk
   reduction.},

Title = {Projected Scenarios for Coastal First Nations' Fisheries Catch Potential
   under Climate Change: Management Challenges and Opportunities},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Studies have demonstrated ways in which climate-related shifts in the
   distributions and relative abundances of marine species are expected to
   alter the dynamics and catch potential of global fisheries. While these
   studies assess impacts on large-scale commercial fisheries, few efforts
   have been made to quantitatively project impacts on small-scale
   subsistence and commercial fisheries that are economically, socially and
   culturally important to many coastal communities. This study uses a
   dynamic bioclimate envelope model to project scenarios of
   climate-related changes in the relative abundance, distribution and
   richness of 98 exploited marine fishes and invertebrates of commercial
   and cultural importance to First Nations in coastal British Columbia,
   Canada. Declines in abundance are projected for most of the sampled
   species under both the lower (Representative Concentration Pathway
   {[}RCP] 2.6) and higher (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios (-15.0\% to
   -20.8\%, respectively), with poleward range shifts occurring at a median
   rate of 10.3 to 18.0 km decade(-1) by 2050 relative to 2000. While a
   cumulative decline in catch potential is projected coastwide (-4.5 to
   -10.7\%), estimates suggest a strong positive correlation between the
   change in relative catch potential and latitude, with First Nations'
   territories along the northern and central coasts of British Columbia
   likely to experience less severe declines than those to the south.
   Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is projected between latitude
   and the number of species exhibiting declining abundance. These trends
   are shown to be robust to alternative species distribution models. This
   study concludes by discussing corresponding management challenges that
   are likely to be encountered under climate change, and by highlighting
   the value of joint-management frameworks and traditional fisheries
   management approaches that could aid in offsetting impacts and
   developing site-specific mitigation and adaptation strategies derived

Title = {Climate change risk and adaptation costs for stormwater management in
   California coastal parklands},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE},
Abstract = {Extreme precipitation from climate change may strain many existing
   stormwater systems. While studies have evaluated such effects on
   stormwater infrastructure, other sources of uncertainty not yet explored
   should also be considered. This paper presents an analysis of adaptation
   costs for new stormwater infrastructure to mitigate increases in design
   storm precipitation depth with climate change, including how economic
   and managerial uncertainty related to life cycle unit costs and
   knowledge of existing infrastructure affect costs. For case study areas
   in California, we quantify adaptation costs for new green infrastructure
   capacity by evaluating future design storms. Results indicate that
   design storm depths increase by an average of 28\%, but lack of
   knowledge of the condition of existing infrastructure and life cycle
   unit costs result in wide cost ranges. The findings illustrate how
   climate change planning for stormwater should also consider economic and
   managerial uncertainty when estimating long-term adaptation costs.},

Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rainfall is a key component of the hydrological cycle, and its
   spatiotemporal variability is essential from the both scientific and
   practical perspectives. This study is focused on analysis of temporal
   variability and trends in historical rainfall records for stations in
   the Geba River basin. The Geba catchment is surrounded by the Danakil
   basin in the east, by the Tekeze River basin in the south, and the Werie
   River basin in the west which is located in the northern Ethiopia
   regional state of Tigray between 38 degrees 38' E and 39 degrees 48' E
   and 13 degrees 18' N and 14 degrees 15' N. The climate over the basin is
   semi-arid and has large elevation differences varying from 926 to 3301 m
   above mean sea level. Daily rainfall data of 43 years measured at seven
   stations in the basin for the period of 1971 to 2013 for annual and
   seasonal rainfall trends have been processed and used for the analysis.
   The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope estimator have
   been used to identify the existence of trends and slope magnitude in
   rainfall. Results revealed that although there was a mix of positive and
   negative trends, they were no statistically significant except at one
   station which showed an increasing trend in annual rainfall. Considering
   rainfall in different seasons, an increase in rainfall was observed in
   two stations in the wet season which, however, was not statistically
   significant. For the remaining stations, a weak decline in wet season
   rainfall (not statistically significant at 95 \% confidence level) for
   four stations and absence of trend for one station were noticed.
   Furthermore, no statistically significant trend (positive or negative)
   was evident for the dry season rainfall. Results of this study may prove
   useful in the preparation of climate change mitigation and adaptation
   strategies in rainfed agricultural and water supply systems in the
   region.},

Title = {Climate change and aquaculture: considering biological response and
   resources},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {569-602},
Abstract = {The heavy reliance of most global aquaculture on the ambient environment
   suggests inherent vulnerability to climate change effects. This review
   explores the potential effects of climate change stressors on
   aquaculture biology and resources needed to support decision-making for
   vulnerability assessment, planned adaptation, and strategic research
   development. Climate change-mediated physiochemical outcomes important
   to aquaculture include extreme weather, precipitation and surge-based
   flooding, water stress, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, saltwater
   intrusion, and changes to temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen.
   Culture practices, environment, and region affect stressor exposure, and
   biological response between species or populations are not universal.
   Response to a climate change stressor will be a function of where
   changes occur relative to optimal ranges and tolerance limits of an
   organism's life stage and physiological processes; the average magnitude
   of the stressor over the production cycle; stressor rate of change;
   variation, frequency, duration, and magnitude of extremes; epigenetic
   expression, genetic strain, and variation within and between
   populations; health and nutrition; and simultaneous stressor occurrence.
   The effects of simultaneous stressors will frequently interact, but may
   not be fully additive or synergistic. Disease is a major aquaculture
   limiter, and climate change is expected to further affect plant and
   animal health through the host and/or infectious agents. Climate change
   may introduce further complexity to the aquaculture-wild fishery
   relationship, with over two-thirds of animal aquaculture production
   dependent on external feed inputs. Higher production costs could be an
   economic outcome of climate change for many aquaculture sectors. Some
   aquaculture practices may inadvertently reduce resiliency to climate
   change, such as a reduction of coastal vegetation, coastal ground-water
   pumping, and reduction of population variability in pursuit of
   consistent production traits. Information from the largest aquaculture
   producers such as China and the top 3 global culture species is still
   sparse in the literature. This potentially limits thorough understanding
   of climate change effects on some regional aquaculture sectors.},

Title = {Future Seasonal Drought Conditions over the CORDEX-MENA/Arab Domain},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Seasonal drought is often overlooked because its impacts are less
   devasting than meteorological or hydrological drought. Nevertheless,
   short-term drought can have significant impacts on soil moisture
   content, agricultural crop yield, and sand and dust storms. Using data
   obtained from bias-corrected regional climate modelling (RCM) outputs,
   future seasonal drought is investigated over the water-scarce Arab
   domain using SPI-3. The climate modelling outputs include three
   downscaled mainframe GCMs downscaled using a single RCM for two climate
   scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results across the region exhibit spatial
   and temporal variability. For example, Rift Valley, in the eastern
   sub-Sahara, projects less frequent and less severe drought, particularly
   during the winter (DJF) months. Conversely, the Morocco Highlands and
   adjacent Mediterranean coast signals a dramatic increase in drought by
   end-century during winter (DJF) and spring (MAM). Moderate increase in
   drought indicated in the greater Mashreq in spring (MAM) can be linked
   to sand and dust storm risk. Thirdly, autumn drought (SON) is linked to
   increased forest fire risk in the Levant. Projected increases in drought
   frequency and severity call for adaptation measures to reduce impacts.},

   agriculture and food security},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-43},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate change and variability are a major threat to the agricultural
   sector globally. It is widely accepted that the changes in temperature,
   rainfall patterns, sea water level and concentration of CO(2)in the
   atmosphere will have the most devastating impacts on agricultural
   production. This paper examines the past and future crop production and
   food security in Kenya under variable climate. From the review, it is
   evident that the country is already experiencing episodes of climate
   change, manifested by seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature
   of varying severity and duration despite overreliance on rain-fed
   agriculture. The findings also reveal that climate change would continue
   to negatively affect crop production and food security to the already
   vulnerable communities in the arid and semi-arid areas. Future
   projections also indicate that climate variability will likely alter
   cropping patterns and yields in several regions. As the country is faced
   with a high population growth rate and rapid urbanization, crop
   production and food security systems need to become more adaptive as
   uncertainties of projected climate variability and change unfold. This
   study is important in providing decision makers and interested
   stakeholders with a detailed assessment of climate impacts and
   adaptation strategies geared towards improved crop production and food
   security.},

Title = {System integration by developing adapters using a database abstraction},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {357-364},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context: Large software systems are usually developed by integrating
   several smaller systems, which may have been developed independently.
   The integration of such systems often requires the development of a
   custom adapter (sometimes called mediator or glue logic) for bridging
   any technical incompatibilities between the systems.
   Adapter development often focuses on how to respond to events from the
   external interfaces, e.g., by applying data conversions and performing
   events on (other) external interfaces. Such an operational focus is
   closely related to an implementation of the adapter, but it makes it
   complicated to reason about complex adapters. For example, it requires a
   lot of effort to understand the relation that the adapter establishes
   between the systems to be integrated, and to avoid any internal
   inconsistencies.
   Objective: This article investigates a way to develop adapters in terms
   of a more abstract, model-based specification. Experts from the
   application domain should be able to reason about the specification, and
   the specification should contain enough details to generate an
   implementation.
   Method: Based on a few industrial adapters from the domain of Maritime
   Safety and Security, we study ways to specify them conveniently, and
   ways to generate them efficiently. On this basis, we identify an
   approach for developing adapters. In turn, this approach is validated
   using an additional set of adapters.
   Results: After abstracting from the details of the interface
   technologies, the studied adapters could be generated using techniques
   for incremental view maintenance. This requires an adapter specification
   in terms of database views to relate the main semantic concepts in the
   application domain.
   Conclusion: For developing adapters, it can be useful to model all
   interface technologies as database operations. Thus adapters can be
   specified using database views, which improve the conceptual
   understanding of the adapters. Publish/subscribe-style adapters can then
   be generated using incremental view maintenance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The fragility of geographically isolated islands stresses the necessity
   of evaluating the current situation, identifying temporal trends and
   suggesting appropriate conservation measures. To support this, we
   assessed the freshwater quality of three stream basins on San Cristobal
   (Galapagos) for two consecutive years. Abiotic conditions generally
   complied with existing guidelines, except for the pH in the Cerro Gato
   basin (<6.5) and orthophosphate concentrations in 2016 (>0.12 mg P L-1).
   Macroinvertebrate communities were characterized by low family richness
   (3-11) and were dominated by Atyidae or Chironomidae, thereby causing
   low diversity (0.33-1.65). Spatial analysis via principal component
   analysis (PCA) illustrated that abiotic differences between stream
   basins were mostly related to turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and
   conductivity. Biotic differences were less clear due to masking by
   anthropogenic disturbances and dispersal limitations, yet indicated a
   negative effect of reduced pH and DO on Atyidae presence. In 2017,
   significantly narrower ranges were found for turbidity, temperature, pH,
   and diversity (p < 0.01), suggesting a decrease in habitat variability
   and a need for conservation measures, including mitigating measures
   related to dam construction for water extraction. As such, further
   follow-up is highly recommended for the sustainable development and
   environmental protection of this unique archipelago.},

Abstract = {Resilience has increasingly become the principal management priority and
   planning goal for cities, especially for climate change adaptation. Yet
   few studies have evaluated whether and how well resilience are
   integrated into climate change adaptation planning. In this study, we
   first conceptualized resilience as five key elements (i.e., system,
   collaboration, uncertainty, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity) and
   developed a coding protocol based on these key elements. We then used it
   to evaluate a sample of 50 climate change plans in the United States
   (US) that has a major adaptation component. We found that the concept of
   resilience has not been adequately embedded in US climate change plans
   and that the predominant notions of resilience has limited influence on
   how well plans integrate resilience. We also found that standalone
   adaptation plans outperform hybrid plans in addressing uncertainty and
   fostering systems thinking. Ultimately, major barriers exist in
   translating the concept of resilience into climate change planning
   practice. We further offer implications for cities to more effectively
   plan for climate resilience.},

Title = {Heat waves and urban heat islands in Europe: A review of relevant

Abstract = {The climate change and the proceeding urbanization create future health
   challenges. Consequently, more people around the globe will be impaired
   by extreme weather events, such as heat waves. This study investigates
   the causes for the emergence of surface urban heat islands and its
   change during heat waves in 70 European cities. A newly created climate
   class indicator, a set of meaningful landscape metrics, and two
   population-related parameters were applied to describe the Surface Urban
   Heat Island Magnitude (SUHIM) - the mean temperature increase within the
   urban heat island compared to its surrounding, as well as the Heat
   Magnitude (HM) - the extra heat load added to the average summer SUHIM
   during heat waves. We evaluated the relevance of varying urban
   parameters within linear models. The exemplary European-wide heat wave
   in July 2006 was chosen and compared to the average summer conditions
   using MODIS land surface temperature with an improved spatial resolution
   of 250 m. The results revealed that the initial size of the urban heat
   island had significant influence on SUHIM. For the explanation of HM the
   size of the heat island, the regional climate and the share of central
   urban green spaces showed to be critical. Interestingly, cities of
   cooler climates and cities with higher shares of urban green spaces were
   more affected by additional heat during heat waves. Accordingly, cooler
   northern European cities seem to be more vulnerable to heat waves,
   whereas southern European cities appear to be better adapted. Within the
   ascertained population and climate clusters more detailed explanations
   were found. Our findings improve the understanding of the urban heat
   island effect across European cities and its behavior under heat waves.
   Also, they provide some indications for urban planners on case-specific
   adaptation strategies to adverse urban heat caused by heat waves. (C)

Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {79},
Number = {3},
Pages = {633-647},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Tropical fisheries tend to be multispecies and require management
   approaches adapted to high diversity but scarce and poorly informative
   data. Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis-PSA is particularly
   useful where catch or biological data are incomplete, aggregated across
   species or insufficient for quantitative stock assessment. We applied
   PSA to estimate vulnerability and potential risk to target and
   non-target species caught by the small-scale shrimp fishery in northeast
   Brazil, adapting the method to regional conditions and incorporating an
   assessment of uncertainties caused by its subjective choices. Our
   findings suggest that non-target species can be more vulnerable than
   target ones. Bagre marinus, Pseudobatos percellens, Micropogonias
   furnieri, Hypanus guttatus, Macrodon ancylodon, Polydactylus virginicus,
   Rhizoprionodon porosus, Cynoscion virescens, Larimus breviceps, and
   Menticirrhus americanus, were the top 10 species potentially at risk due
   to their low productivity (long lifespans, low spawning), high capture
   rates of juveniles and overlap of feeding and breeding grounds with
   fishing areas. Most species (76\%) maintained the same risk category
   (low, moderate, or high) regardless of the score weighting or
   productivity and susceptibility attribute boundaries applied. Overall,
   the target species are not currently the main ones threatened, but
   bycatch such as elasmobranchs, catfishes and Scianidae should be
   prioritized for assessment and data collection.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This communication discusses climate change adaptation efforts underway
   in Vanuatu. In particular, it uncovers why community-based approaches to
   adaptation are more likely to bear fruit than ones driven from the
   top-down at the national level. The authors make this claim based on
   early evidence that small-scale projects (a) support community ownership
   over adaptation, (b) provide ongoing technical learning lessons (c)
   relieve pressure from capacity constraints at national administrative
   bodies, and (d) expedite implementation by avoiding cumbersome
   multilateral procedures. The first section discusses its research
   methods and presents important characteristics of the Vanuatu economy,
   people and geography. The communication then moves on to discuss
   Vanuatu's vulnerability to the effects of climate change. It
   specifically investigates on-going efforts to adapt to natural climatic
   hazards in Vanuatu. Early evidence and analysis reveals lessons salient
   for energy and climate policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Arctic roads and railways: social and environmental consequences of
   transport infrastructure in the circumpolar North},
Journal = {ARCTIC SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Land-based transport corridors and related infrastructure are
   increasingly extending into and across the Arctic in support of resource
   development and population growth, causing large-scale cumulative
   changes to northern socio-ecological systems. These changes include the
   increased mobility of people, goods and resources, and environmental
   impacts on landscapes and ecosystems as the human footprint reaches
   remote, unindustrialized regions. Arctic climate change is also
   generating new challenges for the construction and maintenance of these
   transport systems, requiring adaptive engineering solutions as well as
   community resilience. In this review article, we consider the complex
   entanglements between humans, the environment, and land transportation
   infrastructure in the North and illustrate these interrelations by way
   of seven case studies: the Baikal- Railway, and proposed railways on
   Baffin Island, Canada. As new infrastructure is built and anticipated
   across the circumpolar North, there is an urgent need for an integrated
   socio-ecological approach to impact assessment. This would include full
   consideration of Indigenous knowledge and concerns, collaboration with
   local communities and user groups in assessment, planning and
   monitoring, and evaluation of alternative engineering designs to contend
   with the impacts of climate change in the decades ahead.},

Title = {Future losses of ecosystem services due to coastal erosion in Europe},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {760},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion is a major issue facing Europe that will only worsen
   under future climate change and the resulting sea level rise. One effect
   of erosion is the loss of ecosystem services, which are provided by
   coastal areas, such as provisioning, regulating, habitat, and cultural
   services. These services can be quantified in monetary terms. Here, we
   present comprehensive estimates of future decline in coastal ecosystem
   services due to the erosion of sandy coastlines. We used datasets
   derived from remote sensing products: a pan-European land cover/use
   dataset (Corine Land Cover) and new global probabilistic coastal erosion
   projections constrained by artificial and topographical barriers to
   erosion. The results include historical changes (2000-2018) and
   projections under two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 2050
   and 2100 together with uncertainty bounds. We estimate that in 2018, the
   coastal zone (excluding open sea) included 579,700 km(2) of habitats
   generating 494 billion euros of services annually. The future sea-level
   rise could erode 1.0\% {[}90\% confidence interval 0.7-1.5\%] of the
   2018 area under RCP4.5, and 1.2\% {[}0.7-2.2\%] under RCP8.5. The
   decline in services would be even greater: 4.2\% {[}3.0-6.1\%] under
   RCP4.5, and 5.1\% {[}3.3-8.5\%] under RCP8.5. The highest absolute
   losses would be sustained by salt marshes, while relative losses would
   be highest in beaches, sands, and dunes. The most affected countries in
   relative economic terms would be Denmark, Albania, Greece, Estonia, and
   Finland, but countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and France
   would be among those losing the largest share of their coastal ecosystem
   services. Regional analysis using NUTS 3 regions shows high diversity of
   the impacts, with many regions along the North Sea and eastern
   Mediterranean Sea that are heavily affected by coastal erosion-induced
   loss of ecosystem services. The study highlights the urgency of
   undertaking mitigation actions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The importance of calibrating climate change projections to local
   conditions at aquaculture sites},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {514},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Future climate projections are usually only available at global or
   coarse scale and the focus is often on long-term global or regional
   averages. Though useful to analyse general trends and identify potential
   risks and opportunities internationally, these resolutions are unable to
   capture the complexity of coastal areas where aquaculture is located,
   and poorly represent the environmental variabilities to which cultured
   organisms are subjected. Consequently, most aquaculture planning and
   management decisions require information at a much finer scale. If
   climate projections do not adequately represent conditions experienced
   at aquaculture sites, potential impacts could be missed, adaptation
   strategies may be inappropriate, and time and resources could be spent
   implementing ineffective measures. To demonstrate this, we focus on sea
   temperature and the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in
   Norway, the world's leading salmon producer and a country with a
   latitudinal range that exemplifies the challenges related to
   generalization of farming practises. The results show that if coarse
   resolution climate model temperatures were used directly, then impacts
   on salmon culture could be severely over or underestimated. For
   overlapping reference periods, the average daily modelled temperatures
   at selected sites frequently differed by several degrees, with the
   largest differences being over 6 degrees C, when compared to daily
   average farm measurements. This has serious biological and economic
   implications as potential risks to production could be underestimated
   unless corrected. Here two bias-correction techniques were used to
   calibrate the climate projections to farm scale and shown to more
   accurately reflect the conditions experienced. The calibrated future
   projections for RCP4.5 suggest increased temperatures at all sites may
   require adjustments to existing farm management practices, but the
   nature and severity of the impact will vary with location. Our research
   clearly shows that local scale conditions must be considered, using
   locally resolved climate projections, to develop meaningful adaptation
   plans to meet the growing demand for seafood in a changing climate.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) is a global problem and the
   identification of its sources is essential for adequate mitigation
   strategies. Herein we examined whether AMD density and composition
   differed between two countries with contrasting socio-economic
   backgrounds and marine litter sources (i.e. Chile and Germany). In
   nationwide beach litter surveys, we used a citizen science approach with
   schoolchildren and their teachers. Litter densities were substantially
   higher in Chile than in Germany. The different geographic zones surveyed
   in both countries showed strong grouping tendencies according to their
   main economic activities (tourism, shipping, fisheries/aquaculture),
   major litter sources, and AMD composition, in terms of dominance and
   diversity of AMD types. The results suggest that beach litter
   composition can be used as a simple proxy to identify AMD sources, and
   also that law enforcement and education can help mitigate the problem;
   however, for efficient solutions, production and consumption of plastics
   must be reduced.},

Abstract = {Exposure to disturbance is rarely considered in marine protected area
   planning. Typically, representing and replicating the habitat types
   present within protected areas is used to spread the risk of protecting
   frequently disturbed sites. This was the approach used during the 2004
   re-zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) via the
   Representative Areas Program. Over 10 years later, we examine whether
   the risk was spread by mapping exposure of coral reefs in the GBRMP to
   four disturbances that cause coral mortality: bleaching, tropical
   cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and freshwater inundation.
   Our objectives were to: (1) assess whether no-take areas include a range
   of disturbance regimes, and (2) identify coral reef areas with lower
   relative exposure. At least 13\% and an average of 31\% of reef
   locations in each of 11 exposure classes are included within no-take
   areas. A greater proportion of low-exposure areas are within no-take
   areas than high-exposure areas (34.2\% vs. 28.3\%). The results
   demonstrate the value of risk spreading when exposure data are not
   available while also showing that regularly assessing exposure increases
   capacity for adaptive, resilience-based reef management.},

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities coupled to power plants
   provide a climate change mitigation strategy that potentially permits
   the continued use of fossil fuels whilst reducing the carbon dioxide
   (CO2) emissions. This process involves three basic stages: capture and
   compression of CO2 from power stations, transport of CO2, and storage
   away from the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. Potential
   routes for the capture, transport and storage of CO2 from United Kingdom
   (UK) power plants are examined. Six indicative options are evaluated,
   based on `Pulverised Coal', `Natural Gas Combined Cycle', and
   `Integrated (coal) Gasification Combined Cycle' power stations. Chemical
   and physical CO2 absorption capture techniques are employed with
   realistic transport possibilities to `Enhanced Oil Recovery' sites or
   depleted gas fields in the North Sea. The selected options are
   quantitatively assessed against well-established economic and
   energy-related criteria. Results show that CO2 capture can reduce
   emissions by over 90\%. However, this will reduce the efficiency of the
   power plants concerned, incurring energy penalties between 14 and 30\%
   compared to reference plants without capture. Costs of capture,
   transport and storage are concatenated to show that the whole CCS chain
   `cost of electricity' (COE) rises by 27-142\% depending on the option
   adopted. This is a significant cost increase, although calculations show
   that the average `cost of CO2 captured' is 15 pound/tCO(2) in 2005
   prices {[}the current base year for official UK producer price indices'.
   If potential governmental carbon penalties were introduced at this
   level, then the COE would equate to the same as the reference plant, and
   make CCS a viable option to help mitigate large-scale climate change.

Abstract = {Contexts Urban green infrastructure (UGI) has been recognized as a
   promising approach to mitigating urban heat island (UHI); however, most
   of the previous studies are case-based and explore the effects of the
   existent landscape and its spatial configuration on UHI mitigation
   rather than modeling an optimized spatial pattern. Objectives We aimed
   to transcend the existing research logic (from case studies to obtain
   the patterns of the cooling effect of UGI, then propose implications for
   UHI mitigation) and established a hypothetical idealized urban thermal
   security pattern model (TSPurban). Methods Based on two basic concepts
   deduced from the physical property of UGI-(threshold) size and cooling
   distance, as well as the simplifying assumptions we defined. Then, three
   proposed conceptual UGI types (ecological, efficient, and elementary-3E)
   and subtypes were used to frame the model. Results We deduced that the
   idealized TSPurban model conforms to a hierarchical hexagonal structure
   in theory and it can be calculated and applied, although it generally
   cannot be seen in the real world. Conclusions The idealized TSPurban
   model can help us better-understanding UGI cooling effects when
   considering climate adaption planning and decision-making; it also
   serves as a novel pathway to study the cooling effects of UGI and
   mitigate the UHI effect.},

Abstract = {Kune - Vaini Lagoon System (KVLS), located within the Drini Mati River
   Delta in the Lezha region of Albania, provides a wide range of valuable
   goods and services to nearby communities. A rapid increase in population
   size and widespread poverty in the area have led to an increase in
   pressure on the lagoon for ecosystem goods and services, and to
   unplanned alterations in the buffer zone surrounding the lagoon.
   Unsustainable resources use within the KVLS is also causing a reduction
   in quality and quantity of water in the KVLS affecting lagoon
   productivity, increased coastal flooding and increased sand dune
   erosion. In order to address this problem. Kune Vaini Lagoons System is
   vulnerable to the effects of climate change and is expected to
   experience more intense and frequent floods and storm surges {[}1].
   This study was realised in the framework of ongoing project ``Climate
   changes adaption interventions of the Kune-Vaini lagoon system (Lezha,
   Albania) - ecological approach{''}. Field work was done from July 2018
   to July 2019. with an interval of approximately of two month. Sampling
   took place in five station wich were selected to represent the water
   quality of Kune-Vaini lagoon system.
   This study aimed to evaluate seasonal variation of the TSI reported by
   Lamparelli, using specific TSI values of the total phosphorus (TP) and
   chlorophyll a (Chl a).},

Title = {Consistency in coastal climate adaption planning in Australia and the
   importance of understanding local political barriers to implementation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {131-138},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The discipline of coastal climate adaptation in Australia has been
   increasingly practiced as communities become more aware of the likely
   future impacts of sea level rise. As a result, a number of coastal
   adaptation plans, strategies and guidelines and have been developed for
   coastal urban communities around the Australian coastline over the last
   decade. Given that a number of plans have been developed for different
   communities facing the same issues, it is timely to compare and contrast
   these plans. To this end a set of these coastal adaptation plans
   developed for Australian communities were compared in order to consider
   the variability in the recommended adaptation responses and general
   consistency of the plans. The adaptation responses proposed in the plans
   were also assessed for their ability to be implemented. Despite the
   similarity in the cities and towns considered in the analysis and the
   commonality of risk arising from sea level rise, no consistent set of
   adaptation recommendations arose that was common across the communities.
   This lack of consistency suggests a lack of understanding of the
   effectiveness and implement-ability of many of the proposed adaptation
   responses. This lack of consistency is explored here and it appears that
   many, if not most of the plans considered contained adaptation
   recommendations which will be difficult to implement.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {24},
Pages = {13787-13807},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Made up of calcareous coralline algae, maerl beds play a major role as
   ecosystem engineers in coastal areas throughout the world. They undergo
   strong anthropogenic pressures, which may threaten their survival. The
   aim of this study was to gain insight into the future of maerl beds in
   the context of global and local changes. We examined the effects of
   rising temperatures (+3 degrees C) and ocean acidification (-0.3 pH
   units) according to temperature and pH projections (i.e., the RCP 8.5
   scenario), and nutrient (N and P) availability on three temperate maerl
   species (Lithothamnion corallioides, Phymatolithon calcareum, and
   Lithophyllum incrustans) in the laboratory in winter and summer
   conditions. Physiological rates of primary production, respiration, and
   calcification were measured on all three species in each treatment and
   season. The physiological response of maerl to global climate change was
   species-specific and influenced by seawater nutrient concentrations.
   Future temperature-pH scenario enhanced maximal gross primary production
   rates in P. calcareum in winter and in L. corallioides in both seasons.
   Nevertheless, both species suffered an impairment of light harvesting
   and photoprotective mechanisms in winter. Calcification rates at ambient
   light intensity were negatively affected by the future temperature-pH
   scenario in winter, with net dissolution observed in the dark in L.
   corallioides and P. calcareum under low nutrient concentrations.
   Nutrient enrichment avoided dissolution under future scenarios in winter
   and had a positive effect on L. incrustans calcification rate in the
   dark in summer. In winter conditions, maximal calcification rates were
   enhanced by the future temperature-pH scenario on the three species, but
   P. calcareum suffered inhibition at high irradiances. In summer
   conditions, the maximal calcification rate dropped in L. corallioides
   under the future global climate change scenario, with a potential
   negative impact on CaCO3 budget for maerl beds in the Bay of Brest where
   this species is dominant. Our results highlight how local changes in
   nutrient availability or irradiance levels impact the response of maerl
   species to global climate change and thus point out how it is important
   to consider other abiotic parameters in order to develop management
   policies capable to increase the resilience of maerl beds under the
   future global climate change scenario.},

Abstract = {Urban heat islands (UHIs) exacerbate the risk of heat-related mortality
   associated with global climate change. The intensity of UHIs varies with
   population size and mean annual precipitation, but a unifying
   explanation for this variation is lacking, and there are no
   geographically targeted guidelines for heat mitigation. Here we analyse
   summertime differences between urban and rural surface temperatures
   (Delta T-s) worldwide and find a nonlinear increase in Delta T-s with
   precipitation that is controlled by water or energy limitations on
   evapotranspiration and that modulates the scaling of Delta T-s with city
   size. We introduce a coarse-grained model that links population,
   background climate, and UHI intensity, and show that urban-rural
   differences in evapotranspiration and convection efficiency are the main
   determinants of warming. The direct implication of these nonlinearities
   is that mitigation strategies aimed at increasing green cover and albedo
   are more efficient in dry regions, whereas the challenge of cooling
   tropical cities will require innovative solutions.},

Title = {Mediterranean habitat loss under future climate conditions: Assessing
   impacts on the Natura 2000 protected area network},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {83-92},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean basin is a global hotspot of biological diversity and
   the most rich biodiversity region in Europe. Nevertheless,
   climate-driven habitat loss is one of the most serious concerns for
   biodiversity conservation in this region. We assess Mediterranean
   habitat loss and conversion into arid habitat under scenarios of climate
   change and evaluate protected areas, including Natura 2000 sites, which
   will be affected by these changes. We mapped shifts of Mediterranean and
   arid domains using four bias corrected simulations from Regional Climate
   Models for two emission scenarios over this century, dis-aggregated to a
   1 km grid size. Our results indicate that by the end of the century the
   Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to shift into other climatic
   domains by an area equivalent to 53 -121\% of its current size. However
   it is projected to lose 11-25\% of its current extent, which represents
   an area close to the size of Greece and Portugal combined. The loss is
   entirely due to shifts of the arid domain. Additionally, our results
   indicate that the extent of the arid domain is projected to increase by
   228-450\% of its current size in the European region. The shrinking of
   the current Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to affect 15-23\% of
   the Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites, and the loss in these sites is
   projected at 13-30\% of its current area. Loss is projected to occur in
   central and southern areas of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and
   the island of Sicily, south-eastern Greece, Cyprus, Malta and central
   Turkey. Computed changes in projected climatic parameters indicate that
   current areas of the Euro-Mediterranean domain will be hotter and drier.
   Temperature increase and precipitation decrease are projected to be more
   marked in the summer half of the year. As early as in the 2020s annual
   temperature is projected to increase by 0.9-1.4 degrees C with respect
   to the present reference climate, reaching an increase of 2.2-3.6
   degrees C by the end of the century. By this period, summer
   precipitation is projected to decrease by 24-46\% and annual
   precipitation by 14-23\%. We provide insight into several aspects of
   adaptation and management of Mediterranean protected areas. A proactive
   approach taking into consideration landscape connectivity and the
   concomitant threats triggered by climate change is a priority. Proactive
   adaptation and management promoting investments in Green Infrastructure
   and a denser network of interconnected protected areas are necessary
   instruments for preserving Mediterranean biodiversity from the threats
   of habitat loss. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Dimensions of transboundary legal coherence needed to foster
   ecosystem-based governance in the Arctic},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {110},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Arctic is a complex geographical area to govern sustainably due to
   strong geopolitical and socio-economic interests, high ecological
   vulnerability and importance, and significant legal and institutional
   fragmentation. Intensifying human pressures in this area necessitate an
   ecosystem-based and adaptive governance approach, an approach that
   enables managing socio-ecological resilience in the Arctic. As the
   Arctic is a large geographic area crossing multiple national
   jurisdictions and maritime zones, including high seas areas, regionally
   coordinated and coherent governance approaches would be desirable. This
   paper assesses the status quo for ecosystem-based governance (EBG) in
   the Arctic, suggests a focus on three core components of EBG, and
   proposes three forms of legal coherence to foster these core components.
   The paper concludes with examining what role the Arctic Council plays
   and could play to strengthen EBG in the Arctic.},

Abstract = {With the global acceleration of urbanization, temperatures in cities are
   rising continuously with global climate change, creating an imminent
   risk of urban heat islands and urban heating. Although much research has
   attempted to analyze urban heating from various perspectives, a
   comprehensive approach to urban planning that addresses the problem is
   just beginning. This study suggests a conceptual framework for
   multidisciplinary understanding of urban heating by reviewing 147
   selected articles from various fields, published between 2007 and 2021,
   that discuss urban heating mitigation. From these, we identified several
   outdoor and indoor temperature-reduction factors and proposed
   area-based, zoning-based, and point-based approaches to mitigate urban

Abstract = {Climate change is real and has been causing significant effects on
   livelihood activities of coastal communities of Tanzania. Nevertheless,
   coastal communities have been resorting to various response options in
   trying to address such effects. Hitherto, diminutive consideration has
   been paid on the resulting effects of autonomous, anticipatory, or
   reactive adaptation strategies in practice on coastal and marine
   resources, which is a gap this article addressed. A total of 150 survey
   respondents were randomly selected from village registers for household
   survey. Purposive sampling procedures were used to identify key
   informants, discussants for focus group discussions, and selection of
   the study area. Findings showed that communities have been changing and
   diversifying their livelihood activities significantly as reported by
   71\% and 64\% (p<0.0001) of respondents from Mlingotini and Kondo
   villages respectively. Most respondents acknowledged that their
   responses to adverse impacts of climate change was a problem to coastal
   and marine resources (p<0.041). Respondents affirmed to have been
   involved in decision-making on the use, conservation and management of
   aquatic ecosystems (p<0.0001). Despite their participation, degradation
   of ecosystems was increasing, signifying ineffective resource
   conservation and management. Thus, care should be taken when choosing
   responses to climate change impacts in coastal areas to avoid
   maladaptation practices.},

Abstract = {Climate change scenarios and recent studies on climate variability refer
   to important low-frequency variations of precipitation regimes for the
   northern regions of Mexico. Data on precipitation, streamflow, and water
   levels in storage reservoirs are used to analyze tendencies and changes
   in water availability during the last 30 years. El Nino/Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) events become of particular interest since El Nino
   boreal winters generally result in more precipitation and increased
   water availability in northwestern Mexico. However, summer precipitation
   in the region does not show a clear El Nino signal. Furthermore, the
   interannual variability of precipitation associated with the Mexican
   monsoon does not appear to be modulated by sea surface temperature (SST)
   variations.
   Historically, the economic development of the state of Sonora has been
   constrained by inequitable distribution of transboundary freshwater
   resources, a condition that may seriously worsen in the future. This
   issue will be particularly important in the design of strategies to
   adapt to or ameliorate the negative impacts of climate change. The
   predicted decline in water availability may exacerbate the trend toward
   increasing competition for water resources, namely, between productive
   activities, such as agriculture and industry (particularly
   maquiladoras), and domestic consumption by the increasing population in
   urban areas. These conditions make northern Mexico one of the most
   vulnerable regions in the country to climate changes.},

Title = {Adaptive capacity of Arctic communities in the context of climate change
   and shipping growth: A review of Russian and Western literature},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Abstract = {Throughout the past two decades, the number of studies examining the
   adaptive capacity of Arctic communities in the context of climate change
   has been increasing; however, little is known about Arctic communities'
   ability to adapt to certain emerging changes, such as increased shipping
   activity. To address this knowledge gap, this study systematically
   analyses published scientific articles on community adaptive capacity in
   circumpolar Arctic, including articles published in Russian which may
   not be captured in English-only reviews. Throughout this review, the
   study focuses on three areas: the development of the adaptive capacity
   framework; the conditions that enable community adaption abilities; and
   the extent to which shipping developments are addressed in the
   literature. This study demonstrates that the adaptive capacity framework
   has been significantly developed both theoretically and methodologically
   and is broadly used to address new types of climatic and non-climatic
   changes. Though the impacts from the shipping development are discussed
   in some studies, there is a clear need for further examination of
   coastal communities' ability to adapt to such changes. Additionally, the
   study reveals limitations in the application of the Western conceptual
   terminology when exploring community-based research by Russian scholars.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {288},
Number = {1964},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {There are numerous examples of phenological shifts that are recognized
   both as indicators of climate change and drivers of ecosystem change. A
   pressing challenge is to understand the causal mechanisms by which
   climate affects phenology. We combined annual population census data and
   individual longitudinal data (1992-2018) on grey seals, Halicheorus
   grypus, to quantify the relationship between pupping season phenology
   and sea surface temperature. A temperature increase of 2 degrees C was
   associated with a pupping season advance of approximately seven days at
   the population level. However, we found that maternal age, rather than
   sea temperature, accounted for changes in pupping date by individuals.
   Warmer years were associated with an older average age of mothers,
   allowing us to explain phenological observations in terms of a changing
   population age structure. Finally, we developed a matrix population
   model to test whether our observations were consistent with changes to
   the stable age distribution. This could not fully account for observed
   phenological shift, strongly suggesting transient modification of
   population age structure, for example owing to immigration. We
   demonstrate a novel mechanism for phenological shifts under climate
   change in long-lived, age- or stage-structured species with broad
   implications for dynamics and resilience, as well as population
   management.},

Abstract = {Cholera is a severe diarrhoeal disease affecting vulnerable communities.
   A long-term solution to cholera transmission is improved access to and
   uptake of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Climate change threatens
   WASH. A systematic review and meta-analysis determined five overarching
   WASH factors incorporating 17 specific WASH factors associated with
   cholera transmission, focussing upon community cases. Eight WASH factors
   showed lower odds and six showed higher odds for cholera transmission.
   These results were combined with findings in the climate change and WASH
   literature, to propose a health impact pathway illustrating potential
   routes through which climate change dynamics (e.g. drought, flooding)
   impact on WASH and cholera transmission. A causal process diagram
   visualising links between climate change dynamics, WASH factors, and
   cholera transmission was developed. Climate change dynamics can
   potentially affect multiple WASH factors (e.g. drought-induced
   reductions in handwashing and rainwater use). Multiple climate change
   dynamics can influence WASH factors (e.g. flooding and sea-level rise
   affect piped water usage). The influence of climate change dynamics on
   WASH factors can be negative or positive for cholera transmission (e.g.
   drought could increase pathogen desiccation but reduce rainwater
   harvesting). Identifying risk pathways helps policymakers focus on
   cholera risk mitigation, now and in the future.},

Title = {Varying Inundation Regimes Differentially Affect Natural and
   Sand-Amended Marsh Sediments},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Climate change is altering sea level rise rates and precipitation
   patterns worldwide. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes.
   System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and
   environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin
   layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is
   one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and
   below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water
   constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended
   sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea
   level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field
   experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA).
   Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium
   were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural
   sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing
   salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments
   the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing
   elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high
   inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e.,
   at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were
   measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the
   sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and
   no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the
   lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water
   ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended
   mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and
   rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were
   detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended
   treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate
   and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient
   concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome
   morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments,
   similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the
   end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports
   organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results
   suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate
   adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially
   in areas with low natural sediment supplies.},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) caused by the pelagophyte Aureococcus
   anophagefferens have spread globally and are a threat to coastal
   ecosystems. Although some HAB mitigation techniques such as algal
   biocides can be effective, many such approaches can have negative
   consequences on the environment. Therefore, it is important to
   investigate alternative HAB mitigation approaches that are ecologically
   safe and commercially viable. Here, we examine the effects of two
   rhodophyte seaweeds, Gracilaria tikvahiae and Dasysiphonia japonica, on
   A. anophagefferens. During experiments, multiple A. anophagefferens
   strains were co-cultured with densities of seaweed encompassing a range
   of environmental and aquaculture settings (0.25-3.00 g L-1). The
   co-effects of nutrients, heterotrophic bacteria and pH were also
   assessed, and A. anophagefferens cell concentrations and photosynthetic
   efficiency were quantified. In nearly all experiments, G. tikvahiae and
   D. japonica significantly reduced A. anophagefferens cell concentrations
   in a dose-dependent manner, with the effectiveness of each seaweed
   depending primarily on both A. anophagefferens and seaweed densities.
   The algicidal effects of D. japonica were significantly stronger than G.
   tikvahiae and other algicidal seaweeds (e.g., Ulva spp.). Allelopathy
   was the most potent mechanism for inhibition of A. anophagefferens;
   heterotrophic bacteria, nutrient limitation and elevated pH appeared to
   have lesser co-effects. These findings, in conjunction with the
   well-known nutrient removal capacity of seaweeds, suggest that the
   temporal and spatial dynamics of these rhodophytes may influence brown
   tides in shallow estuaries and that the use of seaweeds such as G.
   tikvahiae in aquaculture may be a promising mitigation strategy for this
   and other HABs in coastal ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise is one of the consequences of global warming that has the
   potential to affect the infrastructure of coastal urban areas. In this
   context, it is important to perform vulnerability assessments in order
   to understand how this infrastructure may be at risk, and, if necessary,
   adapt and maintain functionality of infrastructure systems. This study
   investigates the vulnerability of the wastewater collection and disposal
   infrastructure (i.e. pipelines and manholes, pumping stations and
   wastewater treatment plants) to sea-level rise in eThekwini
   Municipality, South Africa. By using geographical information systems
   (GIS) and a multi-criteria analysis considering elevation, operational
   capacity and connectivity, a scale of vulnerability was established and
   the most vulnerable infrastructural elements were identified in the
   municipality. These should be prioritised for detailed monitoring and
   adaptive interventions in order to maintain the functionality of the
   wastewater system as sea level is predicted to rise. As such this study
   presents a model of how vulnerability of wastewater systems can be
   evaluated in coastal cities.},

Abstract = {We discuss coastal shellfisheries management and governance models in
   Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) at different scales. Self-imposed
   governance with spatial property rights, internal rules and
   co-management resulted in successful local shellfisheries. At the
   national level, the long-term Chilean governability system, which
   included sea-zoning for artisanal and industrial fleets and exclusive
   allocation of rights to artisanal shellfish communities, successfully
   tamed wicked management problems. However, the combination of weak
   governance, globalization of markets, fishing pressure and climate
   change exacerbated depletion patterns in most LAC shellfisheries.
   Increasing market prices exceed the low costs of harvesting low
   abundance coastal shellfish, and together with illegal trade, have
   driven some species to levels close to extinction (anthropogenic Allee
   effect). Mass shellfish mortalities driven by climate variability are
   threatening stocks and may swamp management and governance schemes.
   Coastal shellfisheries urgently require the implementation of resilient
   management and effective long-term governance schemes under pressing
   conditions of change and uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The coastal regions are prone to natural disasters, but the impact
   varies with the geographical location and adaptive capacity of the
   individual countries to cope with the post-disaster situations.
   Historical records show that cyclonic storm and flooding are the major
   disasters experienced, and these inflict heavy loss to agriculture and
   allied sectors. One of the main reasons for poor productivity and
   services of agro-ecosystem is due to uncertain weather and its
   associated natural disasters. On an average, the agriculture
   sector-including crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry-absorbs
   approximately 22\% of the economic impact caused by medium- and
   large-scale natural hazards and disasters. The high impact of natural
   hazards and disasters on agriculture calls for enhanced mainstreaming of
   disaster risk reduction and resilience building within the agricultural
   sectors. Adaptation options such as protective and production measures
   besides proper policy supports are discussed in this chapter.},

Abstract = {With its introduction of large uncertainties, climate change may appear
   to be the ultimate nightmare to a planning system that aims for
   certainty through lines on maps. Recent changes to the planning system
   in England include the adoption of a spatial approach that is wider than
   conventional land-use planning and the placing of sustainable
   development as a core principle of planning. As a result regional and
   local development plans can more readily take account of climate change.
   Policy guidance is available and we know what is likely to happen as a
   result of climate change, though not the scale on which things will
   happen. This personal evaluation of the planning response to climate
   change concludes that measures to mitigate climate change and to adapt
   to the urban heat island have multiple benefits in terms of amenity and
   the environment and basically represent what is already good planning.
   Flooding, coastal erosion and landsliding are now firmly within the
   planner's horizon. Implementation of current policy, to consider these
   weather-related issues as they are now and to test the sensitivity of
   development design against likely changes should lead to an appropriate
   planning response to the need to adapt to climate change.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Introduction: Daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures and
   Diurnal temperature range (DTR) profoundly affect the ecological
   environment and socioeconomic systems. In this study, we project future
   changes in Tmax, Tmin and DTR for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 using
   fine-resolution downscaled data from the 18global coupled models over
   the main regions of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Outcomes: The
   Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) mean projections show that future warming is
   stronger in Tmax than in Tmin, leading to the increased DTR over central
   and southern Europe, many areas surrounding the Black Sea and the
   Caspian Sea, and southeastern China. By contrast, the DTR is projected
   to decline over the regions north of 55 degrees N and other some areas
   due to the more rapid increase in Tmin than in Tmax. As a whole, the
   diurnal asymmetry of projected future temperature changes is found to
   mainly occur from November to March. Conclusions: Our findings
   contribute to the knowledgebase on climate change over the main BRI
   regions. Regarding uneven spatiotemporal changes in Tmax, Tmin and DTR,
   appropriate climate change adaptation strategies, and options should be
   adopted to reduce or avoid disadvantaged consequences to the natural
   system and human society over specific regions.},

Title = {Deep uncertainties in shoreline change projections: an
   extra-probabilistic approach applied to sandy beaches},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2257-2276},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Global mean sea level rise and its acceleration are projected to
   aggravate coastal erosion over the 21st century, which constitutes a
   major challenge for coastal adaptation. Projections of shoreline retreat
   are highly uncertain, however, namely due to deeply uncertain mean sea
   level projections and the absence of consensus on a coastal impact
   model. An improved understanding and a better quantification of these
   sources of deep uncertainty are hence required to improve coastal risk
   management and inform adaptation decisions. In this work we present and
   apply a new extraprobabilistic framework to develop shoreline change
   projections of sandy coasts that allows consideration of intrinsic (or
   aleatory) and knowledge-based (or epistemic) uncertainties exhaustively
   and transparently. This framework builds upon an empirical shoreline
   change model to which we ascribe possibility functions to represent
   deeply uncertain variables. The model is applied to two local sites in
   Aquitaine (France) and Castellon (Spain). First, we validate the
   framework against historical shoreline observations and then develop
   shoreline change projections that account for possible (although
   unlikely) low-end and high-end mean sea level scenarios. Our high-end
   projections show for instance that shoreline retreats of up to 200 m in
   Aquitaine and 130 m in Castellon are plausible by 2100, while low-end
   projections revealed that 58 and 37 m modest shoreline retreats,
   respectively, are also plausible. Such extended intervals of possible
   future shoreline changes reflect an ambiguity in the probabilistic
   description of shoreline change projections, which could be
   substantially reduced by better constraining sea level rise (SLR)
   projections and improving coastal impact models. We found for instance
   that if mean sea level by 2100 does not exceed 1 m, the ambiguity can be
   reduced by more than 50 \%. This could be achieved through an ambitious
   climate mitigation policy and improved knowledge on ice sheets.},

Title = {HERA: A dynamic web application for visualizing community exposure to

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {124-133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Hazard Exposure Reporting and Analytics (HERA) dynamic web
   application was created to provide a platform that makes research on
   community exposure to coastal-flooding hazards influenced by sea level
   rise accessible to planners, decision makers, and the public in a manner
   that is both easy to use and easily accessible. HERA allows users to (a)
   choose flood-hazard scenarios based on sea level rise and storm
   assumptions, (b) appreciate the modeling uncertainty behind a chosen
   hazard zone, (c) select one or several communities to examine exposure,
   (d) select the category of population or societal asset, and (e) choose
   how to look at results. The application is designed to highlight
   comparisons between (a) varying levels of sea level rise and coastal
   storms, (b) communities, (c) societal asset categories, and (d) spatial
   scales. Through a combination of spatial and graphical visualizations,
   HERA aims to help individuals and organizations to craft more informed
   mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate-driven coastal hazards.
   This paper summarizes the technologies used to maximize the user
   experience, in terms of interface design, visualization approaches, and
   data processing.},

Title = {Projected Changes in Precipitation Extremes Over Jiulongjiang River
   Basin in Coastal Southeast China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {The southeast coastal region of China is susceptible to challenges
   related to extreme precipitation events; hence, projection of future
   climate extremes changes is crucial for sustainable development in the
   region. Using the Regional Climate Model Version 4 (RegCM4), the future
   changes of summer precipitation extremes have been investigated over the
   Jiulongjiang River Basin (JRB), a coastal watershed in Southeast China.
   Comparison between the RegCM4 simulated and observed rainy season
   precipitation over JRB suggests that the RegCM4 can reasonably reproduce
   the seasonal precipitation cycle, the frequency distribution of
   precipitation intensity, and the 50-year return levels of precipitation
   extremes over JRB. Furthermore, the model projects an increase in daily
   maximum rainfall (RX1day) mostly over the northern part of the basin and
   a decrease over other parts of the basin, while projecting a widespread
   decrease for maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation amount (RX5day)
   relative to the present day. In terms of the 50-year return level of
   RX1day (RL50yr\_RX1day), a general increase is projected over most parts
   of the basin in the near and far future of the 21st century, but a
   decrease can be found in the northeast and southwest parts of the JRB in
   the mid-21st century. The future change of the 50-year return level of
   RX5day (RL50yr\_RX5day) shows a similar spatial pattern with that of
   RL50yr\_RX1day in the near and mid-21st century, but with a larger
   magnitude. However, a remarkable decrease in RL50yr\_RX5day is found in
   the south basin in the far future. Meanwhile, the projected changes in
   the 50-year return level for both RX1day and RX5day differ between the
   first and second rainy seasons in JRB. Specifically, the future increase
   in RL50yr\_RX5day over the north basin is mainly contributed by the
   changes during the first-half rainy season, while the decrease of
   RL50yr\_RX5day in the south is mostly ascribed to the future changes
   during the second-half rainy season. All above results indicate that the
   future changes of precipitation extremes in JRB are complicated, which
   might differ from extreme indices, seasons, and future projected
   periods. These will thus be of practical significance for flood risk
   management, mitigation, and adaptation measures in Jiulongjiang River
   Basin.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Resilience of food systems is key to ensuring food security through
   crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented shock that
   reveals varying levels of resilience of increasingly interconnected food
   systems across the globe. We contribute to the ongoing debate about
   whether increased connectivity reduces or enhances resilience in the
   context of rural Pacific food systems, while examining how communities
   have adapted to the global shocks associated with the pandemic to ensure
   food security. We conducted 609 interviews across 199 coastal villages
   from May to October 2020 in Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Palau,
   Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu to understand
   community-level impacts and adaptations during the first 5-10 months of
   the COVID-19 crisis. We found that local food production practices and
   food sharing conferred resilience, and that imported foods could aid or
   inhibit resilience. Communities in countries more reliant on imports
   were almost twice as likely to report food insecurity compared to those
   least reliant. However, in places dealing with a concurrent cyclone,
   local food systems were impaired, and imported foods proved critical.
   Our findings suggest that policy in the Pacific should bolster
   sustainable local food production and practices. Pacific states should
   avoid becoming overly reliant on food imports, while having measures in
   place to support food security after disasters, supplementing locally
   produced and preserved foods with imported foods when necessary.
   Developing policies that promote resilient food systems can help prepare
   communities for future shocks, including those anticipated with climate
   change.},

Title = {The contribution of historical information to flood risk management in

Abstract = {Estuarine areas are often affected by flood episodes with significant
   infrastructural and human damages caused by the overlap of different
   triggering factors. Currently flood risk management practices are
   subject to increased scrutiny by the public and relevant stakeholders
   requiring rigorous justification by flood risk managers and careful
   validation of the technical options and human and financial resources
   allocated to the management practice. Therefore, flood risk diagnosis
   through historical sources might constitute an important and effective
   first approach to public policies validation.
   In this paper is presented an estuarine flood damage database based on
   historical information and discussed as to the extent these types of
   sources can contribute to improve estuarine flood risk management in the
   Tagus estuary (Portugal). The paper discusses the methodological
   findings and limitations and highlights the usefulness of historical
   information integrating the results into the International Risk
   Governance Council (IRGC) risk management framework.},

   Australia},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The trend to a hotter and drier climate, with more extended droughts,
   has been observed in recent decades in southern Australia and is
   projected to continue under climate change. This paper reviews studies
   on the projected impacts of climate change on groundwater and associated
   environmental assets in southern Australia, and describes groundwater
   planning frameworks and management responses. High-risk areas are
   spatially patchy due to highly saline groundwater or low-transmissivity
   aquifers. The proportional reduction in rainfall is amplified in the
   groundwater recharge and some groundwater discharge fluxes. This leads
   to issues of deteriorating groundwater-dependent ecosystems, streamflow
   depletion, reduced submarine discharge, groundwater inundation and
   intrusion in coastal regions and reduced groundwater supply for
   extraction. Recent water reforms in Australia support the mitigation of
   these impacts, but groundwater adaptation is still at its infancy. Risk
   management is being incorporated in regional water and groundwater
   management plans to support a shift to a more sustainable level of use
   and more climate-resilient water resources in affected areas. The
   emerging strategies of groundwater trade and managed aquifer recharge
   are described, as is the need for a national water-focused climate
   change planning process.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {We address the question of how to provide meaningful scientific
   information to support environmental decision making at the regional
   scale and at the temporal scale of several decades in a network of
   marine parks in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Where
   environmental sustainability is affected by slow-dynamics climate change
   processes and one-off investments in large infrastructure which can
   affect a region for decades to come, both strategic and reactive
   planning is necessary and prediction becomes as urgent as standard
   adaptive management. At the interface between future studies,
   socio-economic modelling and environmental modelling, we define 18
   scenarios of economic development and climate change impacts and five
   management strategies. We explore these potential futures using coupled
   models of terrestrial and marine ecosystem dynamics. We obtain a
   projection of the Kimberley marine system to the year 2050, conditional
   on the chosen scenarios and management strategies. Our results suggest
   that climate change, not economic development, is the largest factor
   affecting the future of marine ecosystems in the Kimberley region, with
   site-attached species such as reef fish at greatest risk. These same
   species also benefit most from more stringent management strategies,
   especially expansion of sanctuary zones and Marine Protected Areas.},

   Accident},
Journal = {CORROSION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {74},
Number = {5},
Pages = {577-587},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This synopsis describes corrosion issues and mitigation activities
   shortly after the Fukushima Dauchi Nuclear Power Station accident. An
   earthquake of magnitude 9.0 occurred on March 11, 2011; the subsequent
   tsunami removed the cooling capacity of fuels in both the reactors and
   spent fuel pools (SFPs). Seawater was temporarily used for emergency
   fuel cooling, which induced various corrosion issues. Just after the
   accident, the temperatures within the reactors of Units 1 to 3 increased
   to several hundred degrees Celsius and the water quality of the cooling
   water seems to have become similar to that of concentrated seawater. To
   stabilize the fuel cooling, corrosion mitigation actions were required
   for mainly carbon steel components. The following corrosion mitigation
   measures were applied to the reactors: (a) temperature decreases, (b)
   dissolved oxygen removal from feedwater via deaeration, (c) dissolved
   oxygen removal from cooling water in the reactors via nitrogen gas
   injection, (d) salt removal from cooling water, and (e) sterilization of
   feedwater by hydrazine addition. The temperatures of SFP water in Units
   1 to 4 were between 47 degrees C and 93 degrees C just after the
   accident. The maximum chloride ion concentration was approximately 2,000
   ppm and the pH was in the range from 7.5 to 11.2. The mitigation of
   localized corrosion of the stainless steel pool liners and alkaline
   corrosion of the aluminum fuel racks was the top priority. In addition
   to (a), b), and (d) listed above, (f) dissolved oxygen removal and
   sterilization by hydrazine addition and (g) pH control were applied to
   the SFPs. In the six years since the accident, no major corrosion
   problems have yet arisen. However, continued efforts to increase plant
   stability are underway for the longterm goal of decommissioning.},

Title = {Future changes to drought characteristics over the Canadian Prairie
   Provinces based on NARCCAP multi-RCM ensemble},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {2685-2705},

Abstract = {This study assesses projected changes to drought characteristics in
   Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the prairie provinces of Canada,
   using a multi-regional climate model (RCM) ensemble available through
   the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program.
   Simulations considered include those performed with six RCMs driven by
   National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis II for the
   1981-2003 period and those driven by four Atmosphere-Ocean General
   Circulation Models for the 1970-1999 and 2041-2070 periods (i.e. eleven
   current and the same number of corresponding future period simulations).
   Drought characteristics are extracted using two drought indices, namely
   the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized
   Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Regional frequency
   analysis is used to project changes to selected 20- and 50-year regional
   return levels of drought characteristics for fifteen homogeneous
   regions, covering the study area. In addition, multivariate analyses of
   drought characteristics, derived on the basis of 6-month SPI and SPEI
   values, are developed using the copula approach for each region.
   Analysis of multi-RCM ensemble-averaged projected changes to mean and
   selected return levels of drought characteristics show increases over
   the southern and south-western parts of the study area. Based on bi- and
   trivariate joint occurrence probabilities of drought characteristics,
   the southern regions along with the central regions are found highly
   drought vulnerable, followed by the southwestern and southeastern
   regions. Compared to the SPI-based analysis, the results based on SPEI
   suggest drier conditions over many regions in the future, indicating
   potential effects of rising temperatures on drought risks. These
   projections will be useful in the development of appropriate adaptation
   strategies for the water and agricultural sectors, which play an
   important role in the economy of the study area.},

Title = {The tropical Pacific Oceanscape: Current issues, solutions and future
   possibilities},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {166},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Marine ecosystems across the world's largest ocean - the Pacific Ocean -
   are being increasingly affected by stressors such as pollution,
   overfishing, ocean acidification, coastal development and warming events
   coupled with rising sea levels and increasing frequency of extreme
   weather. These anthropogenic-driven stressors, which operate
   cumulatively at varying spatial and temporal scales, are leading to
   ongoing and pervasive degradation of many marine ecosystems in the
   Pacific Island region. The effects of global warming and ocean
   acidification threaten much of the region and impact on the
   socio-cultural, environmental, economic and human health components of
   many Pacific Island nations. Simultaneously, resilience to climate
   change is being reduced as systems are overburdened by other stressors,
   such as marine and land-based pollution and unsustainable fishing.
   Consequently, it is important to understand the vulnerability of this
   region to future environmental scenarios and determine to what extent
   management actions can help protect, and rebuild ecosystem resilience
   and maintain ecosystem service provision.
   This Special Issue of papers explores many of these pressures through
   case studies across the Pacific Island region, and the impacts of
   individual and cumulative pressures on the condition, resilience and
   survival of ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. The
   papers represent original work from across the tropical Pacific
   oceanscape, an area that includes 22 Pacific Island countries and
   territories plus Hawaii and the Philippines. The 39 papers within
   provide insights on anthropogenic pressures and habitat responses at
   local, national, and regional scales. The themes range from coastal
   water quality and human health, assessment of status and trends for
   marine habitats (e.g. seagrass and coral reefs), and the interaction of
   local pressures (pollution, overfishing) with increasing temperatures
   and climate variability. Studies within the Special Issue highlight how
   local actions, monitoring, tourism values, management, policy and
   incentives can encourage adaptation to anthropogenic impacts.
   Conclusions identify possible solutions to support sustainable and
   harmonious environment and social systems in the unique Pacific Island
   oceanscape.},

Title = {Impacts, Systemic Risk and National Response Measures Concerning
   COVID-19-The Island Case Studies of Iceland and Greenland},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The Arctic is a remote region that has become increasingly globalized,
   yet it remains extremely vulnerable to many risks. The COVID-19 pandemic
   presented new challenges to the region. Using the search, appraisal,
   synthesis and analysis (SALSA) approach to conduct a meta-synthesis of
   the academic and grey literature on the impacts of the pandemic, an
   assessment is conducted of the types of risks that have been presented
   by the COVID-19 pandemic, the scales, and the national response
   strategies for mitigating the risks. Two case studies are explored:
   Iceland and Greenland, island nations that exemplify the extremes of the
   Arctic and reliance on tourism, a sector that was nearly entirely
   suspended by the pandemic. An evaluative matrix is employed which
   combines five different scales of risk-nano, micro, meso, macro and
   cosmic-with a sustainability categorization of impacts. The risks of the
   pandemic cut across the respective scale and categories, with the
   potential for macro-scale events (systemic risk) to unfold linked to
   economic spillover effects driven by the curtailment of tourism and
   various supply chain delays. Both Iceland and Greenland have exemplified
   risk mitigation strategies that prioritize health over wealth, very
   strictly in the case of the latter. Strict border controls and domestic
   restrictions have enabled Iceland and Greenland to have much lower case
   and death numbers than most nations. In addition, Iceland has led the
   way, globally, in terms of testing and accumulating scientific knowledge
   through genetic sequencing of the virus. The academic contribution of
   the paper concerns its broadening of understanding concerning systemic
   risk, which extends beyond financial implications to includes
   sustainability dimensions. For policymakers and practitioners, the paper
   highlights successful risk mitigation and science-based measures that
   will be useful for any nation tackling a future pandemic, regardless of
   whether they are island states, Arctic nations or another country.},

Abstract = {AQUO is a Collaborative European Research Project of the 7th Framework
   Program, in the scope of theme ``Sustainable Surface Transport{''},
   topic coordinated with the ``Oceans of Tomorrow{''}. The project started
   in October 2012 for three years duration (see the website www.aquo.eu).
   The final goal is to provide policy makers with practical guidelines and
   solutions, in order to mitigate shipping underwater noise that can have
   negative consequences on marine fauna. The AQUO project addressed it by
   adopting a multi-disciplinary approach bringing together experts of
   naval industry, underwater acoustics and bioacoustics. After a general
   presentation of the project, the goal here is to synthesize the
   guidelines produced by AQUO project. Different types of solutions (ship
   design, ship operational parameters settings, ship traffic control) are
   assessed using three criteria: underwater radiated noise reduction, fuel
   efficiency and impact on marine fauna. For this last topic, an
   underwater noise footprint predictive model has been developed by
   Quiet-Oceans. This methodology allows identifying the most promising
   strategies for the mitigation of the impact of shipping noise on the
   marine fauna, and also the subjacent technical solutions. The results
   show that imposing a limit of underwater radiated noise to the noisiest
   ships seems to be the most effective solution, which is consistent with
   the recent Bureau Veritas notation NR614. After a presentation of some
   examples of concrete results, some conclusions on the main guidelines
   will be given with a proposal of actions plan.},

Title = {The Impact of Possible Decadal-Scale Cold Waves on Viticulture over
   Europe in a Context of Global Warming},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of all the possible impacts of future climate
   change is crucial for strategic plans of adaptation for viticulture.
   Assessments of future climate are generally based on the ensemble mean
   of state-of-the-art climate model projections, which prefigures a
   gradual warming over Europe for the 21st century. However, a few models
   project single or multiple O(10) year temperature drops over the North
   Atlantic due to a collapsing subpolar gyre (SPG) oceanic convection. The
   occurrence of these decadal-scale ``cold waves{''} may have strong
   repercussions over the continent, yet their actual impact is ruled out
   in a multi-model ensemble mean analysis. Here, we investigate these
   potential implications for viticulture over Europe by coupling dynamical
   downscaled EUR-CORDEX temperature projections for the representative
   concentration pathways (RCP)4.5 scenario from seven different climate
   models-including CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 exhibiting a SPG convection collapse-with
   three different phenological models simulating the main developmental
   stages of the grapevine. The 21st century temperature increase projected
   by all the models leads to an anticipation of all the developmental
   stages of the grapevine, shifting the optimal region for a given
   grapevine variety northward, and making climatic conditions suitable for
   high-quality wine production in some European regions that are currently
   not. However, in the CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 model, this long-term warming trend
   is suddenly interrupted by decadal-scale cold waves, abruptly pushing
   the suitability pattern back to conditions that are very similar to the
   present. These findings are crucial for winemakers in the evaluation of
   proper strategies to face climate change, and, overall, provide
   additional information for long-term plans of adaptation, which, so far,
   are mainly oriented towards the possibility of continuous warming
   conditions.},

Abstract = {To enhance the capability of models in better characterizing the urban
   water cycle, physical parameterizations of urban hydrological processes
   have been implemented into the single-layer urban canopy model in the
   widely used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. While the new
   model has been evaluated offline against field measurements at various
   cities, its performance in online settings via coupling to atmospheric
   dynamics requires further examination. In this study, the impact of
   urban hydrological processes on regional hydrometeorology of the fully
   integrated WRF-urban modeling system for two major cities in the United
   States, namely, Phoenix and Houston, is assessed. Results show that
   including hydrological processes improves prediction of the 2-m dewpoint
   temperature, an indicative measure of coupled thermal and hydrological
   processes. The implementation of green roof systems as an urban
   mitigation strategy is then tested at the annual scale. The reduction of
   environmental temperature and increase of humidity by green roofs
   indicate strong diurnal and seasonal variations and are significantly
   affected by geographical and climatic conditions. Comparison with
   offline studies reveals that land-atmosphere interactions play a crucial
   role in determining the effect of green roofs.},

Title = {Double Effects of Age and Environment on Resource Allocation Trade-offs
   of Salix psammophila in Different Microtopographic Habitats of a Sand
   Dune},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {544-552},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Adjustments to the allocation of aboveground biomass allocation are an
   important component of the adaptive strategies of plant growth. Plants
   can modify their biomass allocation patterns to adapt to various
   environmental conditions. Sandy areas vary widely in topography,
   generating a diversity of microenvironments. However, knowledge about
   biomass allocation patterns of shrubs in different microtopographic
   areas in sandy habitats remains limited. Moreover, most studies have not
   considered the effect of age on plant biomass allocation responses to
   habitat differences. In August 2017, we measured the age, height,
   ground-level diameter, and leaf and stem matter of Salix psammophila, a
   species that overwhelmingly dominates a wide range of habitats in China.
   Biomass allocation patterns (leaf vs. stem biomass, biomass vs.
   diameter) were compared between two sandy vegetation environments in an
   area of the Mu Us Sandy Land. The results indicated that the rate of
   biomass accumulation decreased with age and, as shoots aged, they tended
   to allocate more biomass to stems, which provide support and transport
   functions, than to leaves (assimilatory organs). Soil moisture was the
   main environmental factor influencing the allocation strategy of S.
   psammophila. Favorable moisture habitats increased the overall biomass
   accumulation rate by promoting the allocation of biomass to leaf tissue.
   Habitat and age had an interactive effect on biomass accumulation and
   allocation, and larger plants were more likely to suffer from resource
   limitation. This study contributes to a better understanding of the
   life-history strategies of shrubs under frequently changing sandy
   conditions, which can contribute to efforts in vegetation recovery
   management.},

Abstract = {National governments have failed spectacularly to mitigate anthropogenic
   climate change and a sustainable approach to mitigation remains out of
   sight. This circumstance alone demonstrates the need for institutional
   reform. However, climate change is causing and will continue to cause
   large-scale loss and damage. Perhaps the most striking kind of that loss
   is territorial. Climate change induced sea level rise threatens not only
   vast coastal areas but also entire states. Therefore, mitigation is no
   longer sufficient. From the collective failure to mitigate climate
   change arises the collective duty to compensate. Compensating for
   territorial loss puts the spotlight on institutional deficiencies-which
   is why I explore them here. Specifically, I argue that (i) providing
   compensation for territorial loss is both morally required and
   politically advantageous and that (ii) it cannot be implemented
   effectively or efficiently without creating a global institution in
   charge of coordinating the process. Further, I (iii) make design
   recommendations for creating a global compensatory climate fund, (iv)
   situate my proposal within the debate on ideal and non-ideal theory, and
   (v) contend that the proposed institution would be a tool of world
   governance rather than a form of world government.},

   coastal storm surge dynamics that influence regional inundation and can
   help guide surge mitigation strategies for semi-enclosed bay systems. In
   this study, a suite of 80 synthetic tropical cyclones were simulated to
   characterize the volume of surge that flows across Galveston Bays
   complex 98 km coastline, which is made up of tidal inlets, intermittent
   barrier islands, and existing surge defenses along the Upper Texas Gulf
   Coast. Tropical cyclone characteristics analyzed in this study include
   the wide variety of tropical cyclone intensity (V-max) and size (R-max)
   combinations possible for the region, with the storm surge response of
   each tropical cyclone simulated using the ADCIRC + SWAN model. In-depth
   analysis of coastal and in bay storm surge responses was performed for
   baseline or existing conditions as well as scenarios representing severe
   barrier island erosion and future conditions based on intermediate sea
   level projections for the year 2050 and 2 100. Findings demonstrate that
   while the majority of surge may flow across tidal inlets for smaller,
   weaker storms, a storm intensity and size threshold exists that results
   in greater flow across barrier islands, having important implications
   for surge mitigation strategies. Analysis demonstrates that while this
   threshold may occur for extreme tropical cyclones under baseline
   conditions, this transition can occur for relatively, significantly
   weaker and smaller storms under the erosion and sea level rise scenarios
   evaluated.},

   Injection with Surface Dissolution},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) geological storage traditionally involves capturing
   a CO2 stream from a point source such as a power station or from cement,
   steel, or natural gas processing plant, transporting it and compressing
   it, prior to injection as a supercritical phase into a suitable
   geological reservoir overlain by a cap-rock or seal. One of the main
   perceived risks in CO2 geological storage is migration or leakage of the
   buoyant CO2 stream through the seal, via faults or fractures, or other
   migration out of the storage complex. Injection of CO2 dissolved in
   water may be one solution to mitigate the leakage risk. This approach
   could take advantage of large volumes of wastewater already being
   reinjected into saline aquifers worldwide but particularly in North
   America, thus reducing costs. This study examines the potential to
   ``piggyback{''} off the existing wastewater injection industry as a
   novel carbon storage option.},

Abstract = {Small islands are among regions most affected by the impacts of global
   climate change. They are regarded as particularly vulnerable, but from a
   different point of view, island societies also feature a particular
   sociocultural resilience, which distinguishes them from continental
   societies. How do social structures increase the adaptive capacity of
   small islands towards sea-level rise? I consider the concept of social
   capital as applicable in order to understand the role of communities and
   collective action in a context of vulnerability and resilience. In this
   paper, I present results from a case study on the Isles of Scilly, UK. A
   mixed methods qualitative approach has been applied to analyse the
   various roles of social capital for the adaptation to climate change
   impacts on this small archipelago, which is representative of European
   small islands in an economically advanced, but isolated context. The
   Isles of Scilly are among the most vulnerable island regions in Europe.
   The results of the research contribute to the general discussion on
   social capital and the relevance of collective action for the adaptation
   to global climate change. How useful is the concept? And how relevant is
   it for small islands, such as the Isles of Scilly?},

Title = {On the assessment of alternatives for building cooling load reductions
   for a tropical coastal city},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Volume = {182},
Pages = {131-143},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Our goal in this contribution is to study and formulate different
   scenarios that will aid in identifying opportunities to increase
   environmental and energy sustainability of the urban environment of a
   tropical coastal city. These cities are among the most vulnerable to
   climate change and impacts on the energy infrastructures are
   particularly concerning. For this effort, the Weather Research and
   Forecast (WRF) model, with the Building Effect Parameterization and
   Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) schemes are applied to the tropical
   coastal San Juan Metropolitan Area (SJMA) in Puerto Rico. SJMA has a
   total population of 2.0 million inhabitants in a total area of 750
   km(2). Building use and heights required for BEP-BEM are estimated from
   the World Urban Database Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT), Local Climate
   Zones (LCZs) classification, which partitions the urban landscape into
   ten different urban classes. WUDAPT output was compared with
   observations from the NASA ATLAS Mission and NASA Landsat 8 imagery, and
   was found to be in good resemblance for their urban built up class. To
   test energy use and mitigation strategies for SJMA, we consider the heat
   wave event from 09-29-2014 to 10-02-2014. The new modeling methodology
   (BEP-BEM-WUDAPT) was found to improve results from non-urbanized
   versions when compared with observations from a network of weather
   stations. Air conditioning (AC) demand from urban WRF was found to be in
   good agreement with EnergyPlus (TM) simulations and available records
   from the local power utility company. The work explored building energy
   sustainability and mitigating options to include energy efficient
   building materials, white roofs, increase of indoor AC temperature set
   points, and use of high efficiency AC equipment. Among mitigating
   alternatives explored, results show that white roofs, target indoor
   temperatures and high efficient AC systems reduce the total energy
   demand by 6.9\%, 9.9\% and 16.15\%, respectively. Furthermore, when
   considering all alternatives simultaneously, the peak demand decreased
   by 40\% during a tropical heat wave event. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Title = {The climate change double whammy: Flood damage and the determinants of
   flood insurance coverage, the case of post-Katrina New Orleans},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {This paper advances scholarly debate on the contradictions of
   environmental risk management measures by analyzing the determinants of
   flood insurance coverage among a sample of 403 residents in New Orleans,
   a city undergoing rapid transformation due to post-Katrina rebuilding
   efforts and anthropogenic modifications of climate, hydrology, and
   ecology. The paper focuses on several predictors including subjective
   flood risk perception, trust in government officials, sociodemographic
   characteristics, and experience with flood damage. Using binary logistic
   regression, the results show that the likelihood of having flood
   insurance coverage is associated with past flood damage and
   socioeconomic status. Older people (over age 65) are more likely to have
   flood insurance than younger residents. Race, gender, trust, and
   perceived flood risk are not statistically significant predictors of
   flood insurance. We connect our findings to the paradoxes and
   conflictual dynamics of flood insurance, a major risk mitigation
   measure. As we point out, in flood-prone cities like New Orleans, flood
   insurance operates as a double whammy: uninsured or underinsured homes
   face pervasive risk of both flooding and rising insurance premiums under
   the conditions of global climate change.},

Title = {Value of traditional oral narratives in building climate-change
   resilience: insights from rural communities in Fiji},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In the interests of improving engagement with Pacific Island communities
   to enable development of effective and sustainable adaptation strategies
   to climate change, we looked at how traditional oral narratives in
   rural/peripheral Fiji communities might be used to inform such
   strategies. Interviews were undertaken and observations made in 27
   communities; because the custodians of traditional knowledge were
   targeted, most interviewees were 70-79 years old.
   The view that oral traditions, particularly those referring to
   environmental history and the observations/precursors of environmental
   change, were endangered was widespread and regretted. Interviewees'
   personal experiences of extreme events (natural disasters) were
   commonplace but no narratives of historical (unwitnessed by
   interviewees) events were found. In contrast, experiences of previous
   village relocations attributable (mainly) to environmental change were
   recorded in five communities while awareness of environmentally driven
   migration was more common. Questions about climate change elicited views
   dominated by religious/fatalist beliefs but included some more pragmatic
   ones; the confusion of climate change with climate variability, which is
   part of traditional knowledge, was widespread.
   The erosion of traditional environmental knowledge in the survey
   communities over recent decades has been severe and is likely to
   continue apace, which will reduce community self-sufficiency and
   resilience. Ways of conserving such knowledge and incorporating it into
   adaptation planning for Pacific Island communities in rural/peripheral
   locations should be explored.},

Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The IPCC 1.5 degrees C Report lists identifying local capacity needs as
   key for enabling multi-level governance to effectively respond to
   climate change. Mauritius, as a Small Island State, is
   disproportionately affected by climate change, primarily due to its
   exposure to impacts, as well as various constraints in size and
   resources. Identifying and integrating local capacity needs into
   recommendations for policy measures is therefore urgently required to
   support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and
   its National Adaptation Plan process. This study carries out a local
   governance assessment based on evaluative criteria to identify local
   capacity needs for implementing climate change adaptation in Mauritius.
   Results from the assessment indicate that local governance suffers from
   issues inherent to Small Island States, such as lack of technical
   know-how, financial and human resources, stringent legislation and
   effective monitoring mechanisms, preventing effective climate change
   adaptation. Through participatory, bottom-up stakeholder engagement with
   local and national government representatives, eight recommendations for
   policy formulation were then co-developed to address the identified
   capacity needs, and to improve cooperation between local and national
   institutions for more effective implementation of climate change
   adaptation. Key policy insights
   Local climate change adaptation needs have to be integrated into policy
   formulation for an effective response to climate change impacts. Roles
   and responsibilities of government levels for climate change adaptation
   in Mauritius are currently in need of clarification. Capacity building
   measures at the local level for implementing climate change actions from
   national government are urgently required. Stringent legislation and
   effective monitoring mechanisms need to be implemented to ensure
   planning regulations are adhered to. Increased collaboration between
   local and national levels of government in Mauritius is necessary for
   synthesizing a common approach to climate change adaptation.},

Abstract = {River managers worldwide are increasingly addressing flow needs for
   ecosystem processes and services in their management plans for dams and
   reservoirs. However, while planning and scientific assessments have
   advanced substantially, successful re-operation of infrastructure to
   achieve environmental benefits has been more limited. The Sustainable
   Rivers Project (SRP) was formalized in 2002, as a national partnership
   between the United States Army Corps of Engineers and The Nature
   Conservancy to define and implement environmental flows through adaptive
   reservoir management. The Project has focused on eight demonstration
   basins containing 36 Corps dams, but is designed to direct the
   collective experience from these sites to help guide agency-wide
   operational changes for as many as 600 dams to benefit up to 80,000
   river kilometres and tens of thousands of hectares of related floodplain
   and estuarine habitat. This paper summarizes the progress to date on
   defining and implementing environmental flows through the SRP, and
   evaluates the technical, social, legal, and institutional factors that
   act as dominant enabling conditions and constraints to implementation.},

Title = {Climate change affects us in the tropics: local perspectives on
   ecosystem services and well-being sensitivity in Southeast Brazil},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Inequalities in benefits from ecosystem services (ES) challenge the
   achievement of sustainability goals, because they increase the
   vulnerability of socio-ecological systems to climate hazards. Yet the
   unequal effects of changes in ES, and of climate change more generally,
   on human well-being (HWB) are still poorly accounted for in
   decision-making around adaptation, particularly in tropical countries.
   Here, we investigate these dynamics through the lens of local peoples'
   perceptions of ES in relation to human well-being (HWB), and how these
   are affected by climate change in three distinct regional case studies
   in the Atlantic Forest in Southeast of Brazil. Through structured
   questionnaires, we found that the local perceptions of important ES are
   region-dependent, particularly identifying services regulating local
   climate and air quality, water flow and quality, food provisioning, and
   cultural services of landscape esthetics related to forest regeneration.
   HWB was expressed through material (e.g., economic security,
   environmental conditions) and higher accounts of non-material (e.g.,
   feelings, health and social connections) dimensions. Specific
   environmental changes were identified by 95\% of those responding, 40\%
   of whom included climate change as one of these. When asked about
   climate directly, 97\% of those responding identified relevant changes
   in regionally relevant ways. Rising temperatures, unbalanced seasons,
   altered rainfall patterns, drought, increase of extreme events, and sea
   level rise are negatively affecting both material and non-material
   dimensions of HWB across regions. These perceived changes aligned with
   observed and projected climate changes in the regions. Benefits from ES
   accrue for HWB at different scales depending on the specific ES and
   region. For example, crop production by small farmers or exported in
   sugar cane, water captured for agricultural irrigation or used for urban
   supplies, and fish resources for local consumption and lifestyle or as a
   recreational attraction for visitors. Policy choices about such balances
   will affect local vulnerabilities to the expected future climate and
   other environmental changes in the region. This place fine-scale
   observations and the empowerment of local knowledge at the core of
   policy decisions about adaptation to support a climate-resilient future
   for traditional communities and small farmers.},

Title = {Using a Statistical Crop Model to Predict Maize Yield by the
   End-Of-Century for the Azuero Region in Panama},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this article, we evaluate the impact of temperature and precipitation
   at the end of the 21st century (2075-2099) on the yield of maize in the
   Azuero Region in Panama. Using projected data from an atmospheric
   climate model, MRI-ACGM 3.2S, the study variables are related to maize
   yield (t ha-1) under four different sea surface Temperature (SST)
   Ensembles (C0, C1, C2, and C3) and in three different planting dates (21
   August, 23 September, and 23 October). In terms climate, results confirm
   the increase in temperatures and precipitation intensity that has been
   projected for the region at the end of the century. Moreover,
   differences are found in the average precipitation patterns of each
   SST-ensemble, which leads to difference in maize yield. SST-Ensembles
   C0, C1, and C3 predict a doubling of the yield observed from baseline
   period (1990-2003), while in C1, the yield is reduced around 5\%. Yield
   doubling is attributed to the increase in rainfall, while yield decrease
   is related to the selection of a later planting date, which is
   indistinct to the SST-ensembles used for the calculation. Moreover,
   lower yields are related to years in which El Nino Southerm Oscilation
   (ENSO) are projected to occur at the end of century. The results are
   important as they provide a mitigation strategy for maize producers
   under rainfed model on the Azuero region, which is responsible for over
   95\% of the production of the country.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Under many circumstances, the global rural-to-urban migration trend may
   be increasingly adopted as a short-term coping strategy to shifting
   ecologies and natural disasters. While offering certain benefits from
   macro-level economic and public health perspectives, these migrations
   may also have unintended psychological consequences that are not easily
   understood through traditional disaster studies or cost-benefit
   analyses. If the goal of disaster and climate change research is to
   promote successful adaptation, then the long-term psychological
   well-being of people who have survived disaster and either adapted in
   situ or migrated into urban environments, is paramount. This article
   integrates research on disasters and climate change-induced migration
   with emerging perspectives from environmental psychology and the
   psychology of natural disasters to consider the potential costs of
   particular migration scenarios. We apply this analysis to the case of
   Shishmaref, Alaska, a rural Iupiat community on the northwest coast of
   Alaska facing habitual flooding disasters linked to climate change.
   Findings from Shishmaref illustrate the cultural vitality of subsistence
   landscapes and the potential health risks of compromised
   human-ecological relationships due to migration and/or displacement.
   Recommendations for policy makers and researchers are offered for
   promoting long-term well-being among affected individuals and
   communities.},

Title = {Ecological consequences of shoreline armoring on littoral fish and
   benthic macroinvertebrate communities in an Eastern Ontario lake},
Journal = {AQUATIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Shoreline erosion in lakes is a pressing issue for many landowners, yet
   common erosion mitigation practices that involve armoring can alter
   littoral habitat and potentially diminish near-shore biodiversity. We
   studied the effects of two armoring methods (i.e., riprap, retaining
   walls) on habitat, taxonomic richness, relative abundance, and total
   abundance of fishes and benthic macroinvertebrates at shorelines on Big
   Rideau Lake in eastern Ontario, Canada. Snorkel surveys were conducted
   to assess aquatic habitat characteristics and fish diversity, and
   benthic infauna were sampled using kick-nets. Submergent and emergent
   macrophytes were more abundant at natural rocky shorelines compared to
   shorelines modified with riprap or retaining walls. Coarse woody debris
   was also more abundant at natural shorelines compared to riprap and
   retaining wall shorelines. Relative abundances of some fish species
   varied between shoreline types, but overall species richness and total
   abundance did not. Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) were more
   abundant at natural sites than armored sites. Conversely, Rock Bass
   (Ambloplites rupestris), Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), Bluegill
   (Lepomis macrochirus), Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens), and baitfish
   from the family Cyprinidae were more abundant at both types of armored
   sites compared to natural sites. Taxonomic richness of benthic
   macroinvertebrates did not vary among shoreline types, however abundance
   of Amphipoda, Isopoda, Ephemeroptera, and Cladocera was greater at
   armored shorelines. These results suggest that human modification of
   shorelines is altering littoral ecosystems and potentially leading to
   shifts in the community structure of littoral nekton. More study is
   needed to fully understand the community level effects of shoreline
   erosion mitigation involving armoring in freshwater lakes and determine
   the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies that preserve
   natural habitat features.},

Title = {APPRAISING AND SELECTING STRATEGIES TO COMBAT AND MITIGATE
   DESERTIFICATION BASED ON STAKEHOLDER KNOWLEDGE AND GLOBAL BEST PRACTICES

Abstract = {Desertification is the most disturbing and detrimental cause of rural
   vulnerability in Cape Verde, affecting families' material and
   environmental resources. Combating desertification in Cape Verde is
   complex because it involves addressing a mixture of endogenous (manual
   agriculture, fuel wood and fodder extraction, land tenure and steep
   slopes) and exogenous drivers (high rainfall variability, climate
   change, prolonged drought or heavy rainfall). To address and mitigate
   the adverse effects of desertification, it is necessary to develop an
   approach that identifies and brings together all the key stakeholders
   affected by and acting on the desertification issue, including land
   users, policy makers, managers, researchers and rural development
   technicians. This paper presents a hybrid methodology based on global
   best practices, applied in Cape Verde. It combines experiences and
   skills of local stakeholders (farmers, local association of land users
   and local non-governmental organizations) with scientific knowledge of
   external stakeholders such as technicians of the Ministry of Rural
   Development, environmental advisors of Municipalities and researchers.
   Integration takes place following a participatory process of appraising
   and selecting desertification control strategies. The paper presents the
   first results obtained from application of the hybrid methodology to
   Ribeira Seca, the largest watershed of Santiago Island. The approach was
   evaluated with local and external stakeholders. Both groups appreciated
   that they could voice their views and discuss ways to overcome barriers
   and also to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by jointly
   selected promising desertification mitigation options. Copyright (c)

Title = {Resilience strategies in the face of short- and long-term change:
   out-migration and fisheries regulation in Alaskan fishing communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Historically, communities persisted in remote, isolated areas of Alaska
   in large part because of the abundance of marine and terrestrial
   resources, as well as the ability of local people to opportunistically
   access those resources as they became available. Species switching and
   the ability to shift effort away from fisheries during poor years
   allowed local residents to diversify their livelihoods in the face of
   uncertainties and ecological change. The advent of modern fisheries
   management, which views Alaskan fisheries as the property of all
   citizens of the United States, has fundamentally altered the
   relationship of place-based communities to fishery resources. Local
   access to fisheries has been particularly affected by the development of
   transferable fishing privileges, making it possible for fishing rights
   to leave place-based communities through the choices of individual
   community members to sell or to move away. When fishing communities in
   Alaska lose active fishing businesses, over time the loss of various
   types of community capital will follow, including human, social,
   cultural, technical, and financial capital. In some cases, communities
   are able to adapt or transform through diversification of their local
   economies. In other cases, no alternatives to a fishery-based economy
   are accessible. We have used resilience theory to explore drivers of
   change affecting Alaskan fishing communities. Emphasis was placed on two
   primary change drivers, the regulatory environment and rural
   out-migration, as well as their interconnections and their impacts on
   individuals, communities, and the larger social-ecological system. We
   summarized several government programs that have been implemented to
   support the continued participation of communities in Alaskan fisheries.
   In addition, we reviewed informal and private-sector efforts to generate
   resilience strategies that can facilitate new entry into fisheries or
   retain fishing businesses and fishing rights within communities, as well
   as respond to increasing uncertainty related to the global market and
   climate changes.},

Title = {The Environmental Impact of Cattle Access to Watercourses: A Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {340-351},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {The degradation of freshwater resources and loss of freshwater
   biodiversity by anthropogenic activities, including agriculture, are of
   major global concern. Together with diffuse pollutants, point sources,
   such as where cattle have direct access to riparian margins and
   watercourses, can potentially present significant environmental
   challenges. These can include impacts on stream morphology, increased
   sedimentation, nutrient additions, microbial contamination, and impacts
   on aquatic biota. Mitigation measures aimed at reducing these frequently
   include reducing the amount of time cattle spend in riparian margins and
   watercourses. This is often accomplished through the provision of an
   alternative water supply and grazing management, or even cattle
   exclusion measures. Although a number of studies refer to potential
   negative impacts, there has been little attempt to review previous
   research on this topic. The key aim of this paper is to collate and
   review these disparate studies, as well as those relating to the
   effectiveness of mitigation measures. Although it is difficult to draw
   generalizations from studies due to the inherent variability between and
   within catchments, evidence pertaining to impacts in relation to
   sedimentation, pathogens, and riparian margin vegetation were strong.
   Conclusions in relation to impacts on stream morphology and nutrient
   parameters were less clear, whereas studies on responses of
   macroinvertebrate communities were particularly variable, with
   differences due to cattle access difficult to separate from catchment
   scale effects. A greater understanding of the impact of cattle access on
   watercourses under varying conditions will help inform policymakers on
   the cost effectiveness of existing management criteria and will help in
   revising existing measures.},

Title = {The evolution of sea lamprey control in the St. Marys River: 1997-2019},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},

Pages = {S479-S491},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The St. Marys River was historically the single largest sea lamprey
   (Petromyzon marinus) producer in the Great Lakes. Rehabilitation of the
   once thriving Lake Huron fishery that had collapsed due to overfishing
   and habitat degradation was significantly inhibited by this uncontrolled
   source of sea lamprey. In 1997, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission
   implemented an integrated control strategy that incorporated lampricide
   control (granular Bayluscide spot treatments), sterile male release
   technique (SMRT), and enhanced trapping during the spawning migration. A
   decrease in the abundance of juvenile sea lamprey in the St. Marys River
   and a decline in lake trout wounding rates in Lake Huron following
   large-scale granular Bayluscide treatments in 1998, 1999, 2010 and 2011
   indicated that lampricide control was most effective in controlling
   larval sea lamprey abundance in the river. The effects from the SMRT and
   adult trapping, however, could not be fully determined. Uncertainty in
   the efficacy of these alternative control techniques and in
   stock-recruitment relationships, ultimately led to the termination of
   the integrated control strategy. Since 2012, sea lamprey in the St.
   Marys River have been controlled exclusively with granular Bayluscide to
   treat areas with high densities of larvae. An adaptive management
   approach that considers the best available data has been incorporated to
   monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of ongoing control strategies.
   The evolution of sea lamprey control in the St. Marys River has resulted
   in a 90\% reduction in sea lamprey from the river and contributed to
   recovery of the Lake Huron fish community. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Title = {Impact of seagrass loss and subsequent revegetation on carbon
   sequestration and stocks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Number = {2},
Pages = {296-302},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows are sites of high rates of carbon sequestration and
   they potentially support blue carbon' strategies to mitigate
   anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Current uncertainties on the fate of carbon
   stocks following the loss or revegetation of seagrass meadows prevent
   the deployment of blue carbon' strategies. Here, we reconstruct the
   trajectories of carbon stocks associated with one of the longest
   monitored seagrass restoration projects globally. We demonstrate that
   sediment carbon stocks erode following seagrass loss and that
   revegetation projects effectively restore seagrass carbon sequestration
   capacity. We combine carbon chronosequences with Pb-210 dating of
   seagrass sediments in a meadow that experienced losses until the end of
   1980s and subsequent serial revegetation efforts. Inventories of excess
   Pb-210 in seagrass sediments revealed that its accumulation, and thus
   sediments, coincided with the presence of seagrass vegetation. They also
   showed that the upper sediments eroded in areas that remained devoid of
   vegetation after seagrass loss. Seagrass revegetation enhanced
   autochthonous and allochthonous carbon deposition and burial. Carbon
   burial rates increased with the age of the restored sites, and 18years
   after planting, they were similar to that in continuously vegetated
   meadows (26.40.8 gC(org) m(-2)year(-1)).Synthesis. The results presented
   here demonstrate that loss of seagrass triggers the erosion of historic
   carbon deposits and that revegetation effectively restores seagrass
   carbon sequestration capacity. Thus, conservation and restoration of
   seagrass meadows are effective strategies for climate change mitigation.},

Title = {Environmental change and the livelihood resilience of coffee farmers in
   Jamaica: A case study of the Cedar Valley farming region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {220-234},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rapid socio-ecological changes are transforming coffee production
   systems causing hardship and uncertainty among farmers across the
   Caribbean. The uncertainty and magnitude of environmental change have
   been superimposed on longstanding issues of marginalization and
   multidimensional poverty among rural farmers. The combined and
   interactive effects of these conditions create complex trade-offs that
   hinder the uptake of effective climate action. In the last two decades
   or so, Jamaica's coffee sector has been severely affected by
   socioeconomic, environmental and institutional stressors resulting in
   rapid declines in the production and livelihood conditions of thousands
   of farmers across the island. To address these challenges, multilateral
   donors, government and non-government agencies have advanced several
   climate resilience programs in the last decade. Yet, there is a paucity
   of research on the livelihood resilience of farmers to socio-ecological
   change, and effective metrics to monitor and evaluate adaptation
   responses. In this paper, the experience and knowledge of coffee farmers
   (n = 219) in the Cedar Valley region of Jamaica are used to examine the
   factors shaping patterns of livelihood resilience within the context of
   socio-ecological changes. Quantitative survey data are combined with
   qualitative information from focus group discussions and key informant
   interviews to develop storylines around the domains of livelihood
   resilience. The results provide baseline information on the livelihood
   resilience of local coffee farmers and within the context of changing
   social, agronomic and environmental conditions. Understanding how these
   factors shape local livelihood resilience processes can strengthen local
   response options, identify possible entry points for improving climate
   action and establish monitoring and evaluation metrics to track progress
   and outcomes of climate resilience interventions.},

Abstract = {Climate Change effects can be analysed from different points of view. As
   far as harbour and coastal engineering are concerned, the most worrying
   effect is the sea level rise, having been observed over the whole planet
   during the 20th century, reaching figures up to 1 or 2 millimetres per
   year. Lately, it has been seen an acceleration of the process,
   developing an annual rise rate of 3 millimetres in the period between
   1993 and 2003. In Spain, this rise in sea level can be estimated between
   3 and 5 millimetres a year, although this value is not uniform along the
   whole coastline. The prediction for the first half of the 21st century
   forecasts a sea level rise of more than 3 centimetres in the Cantabrian
   coast, between 15 and 20 centimetres in the Mediterranean Sea and 10 in
   the Gulf of Cadiz, South West of Spain, in the Atlantic Ocean. This
   means that beaches will shrink between 10 and 15 metres in the
   Cantabrian, between 8 and 10 metres in the Mediterranean and 8 metres in
   the Gulf of Cadiz. These movements may affect structures and properties
   located on the coast and create concerns amongst people living there,
   particularly when facing extreme climate events. This research reflects
   on these phenomena and proposes an action strategy to achieve resilient
   coastal and harbour structures, in order to make them able to cope with
   any extreme events that may occur.},

Title = {Assessing the management effectiveness of China's marine protected
   areas: Challenges and recommendations},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {224},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Rapid population growth is putting enormous pressure on fragile marine
   ecosystems. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a widely adopted
   management tool to address these challenges, but their conservation
   effectiveness is uncertain, especially in developing countries such as
   China. Management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) is an efficient method
   for assessing MPA outcomes and identifying key impact factors. However,
   only a limited number of MEEs have been conducted for China's MPAs in
   the past two decades, thus largely limiting their improvement of
   management. In this context, we conducted a comprehensive review of MPAs
   status and existing MEEs in China. We found that despite the significant
   increase in the number and coverage of China's MPAs, their conservation
   effectiveness might be impacted by the lack of systematic planning,
   adequate funding, appropriate zoning, long-term monitoring, and sound
   laws. Major challenges to the evaluation of MPA management
   effec-tiveness in China include the lack of a standardized framework,
   limited survey data, financial support, and public engagement. To
   address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive framework based
   on the common objectives of China's MPAs and existing MEE frameworks. We
   also recommend based on the developed frame-work: 1) establishing
   long-term monitoring pilots in national MPAs; 2) providing sustained
   funding support for MEE, monitoring and capacity building from
   government, social capital, and ecotourism; and 3) promoting public
   participation in MPA management and evaluation through advocacy,
   incentive mechanisms, and estab-lishment of committees. Adopting our
   recommendations can strengthen adaptive management and provide new
   insights into evidence-based decision-making for MPAs in China.},

Title = {Lessons learned from investing in marine and coastal management
   initiatives in the East Asian Seas},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {355-364},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The concept that underlies the interventions of the Global Environment
   Facility (GEF) International Waters Program is adaptive management at
   the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) scale across the sequence of
   interventions from assessment and analysis to development of regional
   strategic action programs and national implementation of action plans to
   address transboundary environmental concerns. The GEF has provided
   grants to recipient countries in the East Asian Seas region covering
   five LMEs since the early 1990s and amounting to about US\$200 million.
   This paper analyses GEF support to the Seas of the East Asian Region to
   draw lessons for future investments in LME management. To identify
   investment gaps and the overarching drivers of environmental degradation
   across scales, transboundary diagnostic analysis of LMEs need to be
   linked to analysis of existing investment flows. Most funding for
   implementation of strategic action programs should be targeted at the
   national level, as interventions at this level are on average leveraging
   much more co-financing to GEF projects than regional interventions.
   Better coordination and agreed procedures and methodologies among
   different regional entities, programs and projects are necessary in
   regions, such as the EAS, with multiple regional initiatives at
   different scales. Better coordination of financial support to programs
   and projects operating at different scales would also strengthen the
   extent to which ecosystem-based management could be applied through
   better harmonization of management frameworks and tools for marine and
   coastal management from local to national to regional levels. Strategies
   towards achieving sustainable financing should be encouraged and
   implemented to ensure adaptive management and achievement of goals and
   targets under SAPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aquifers of Oum Er Rbia basin show a significant imbalance between
   the groundwater input and output because of their overexploitation for
   agriculture and drinking water uses. Indeed, in 2012, groundwater
   extractions reached 608 million m(3) while groundwater potential was
   only 347 million m(3), yielding a deficit of nearly 300 million m(3).
   Moreover, climate change will have a certain impact on the future of
   these resources. Recent studies predicted an increase in the mean annual
   temperature ranging between 0.1 and 1.4 degrees C by the period
   2010-2030, and a decrease in the average annual rainfall of about 200 mm
   The demand for irrigation water and drinking water will yet increase
   given the population growth coupled with progressive economic
   development. Climate change will adversely have an impact on aquifers
   recharge and the level of their water table, and consequently, the gap
   between supply and demand will increasingly rise. Groundwater models
   that take into account regional climate scenarios, are necessary to
   predict the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater resources
   sustainability. In this work, a reflection on a more efficient and
   sustainable management of groundwater resources in the Oum Er Rabia
   basin will be presented. The primary goal is to fill the gap between
   water supply and demand through climate change adaptation actions, in
   particular, the use of non-conventional water resources such as
   desalination of sea water, reuse of treated wastewater, rainwater
   harvesting, optimization of irrigation infrastructures and the adoption
   of projects of water transfer from other national basins with excess
   water.},

Abstract = {The Grey-headed Flying-fox, Pteropus poliocephalus, is listed as a
   threatened species in NSW, Victoria and nationally. The Grey-headed
   Flying-fox is a key species in maintaining forest ecosystems through the
   pollination of native trees and the dispersal of rainforest seeds. This
   threatened species is unique in that it is also recognised as a
   horticultural pest, predominantly in coastal orchards of south-eastern
   Australia. In times of native resource (pollen, nectar and rainforest
   fruits) shortage, flying-foxes are known to utilise commercial fruit
   crops. As such, the species is affected by control techniques employed
   by horticulturists to mitigate flying-fox damage, including shooting and
   netting.
   The NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change and the NSW
   Department of Primary Industries are working collaboratively to
   investigate flying-fox damage to commercial crops, quantify the levels
   of flying-fox damage (temporally and spatially), determine the factors
   contributing to trends in crop damage, and assess the effectiveness of
   mitigative measures employed by horticulturists to reduce flying-fox
   damage. The project is funded for two financial years through the
   Australian Government's Natural Heritage Trust Strategic Reserve funding
   and State Government contributions (cash and in-kind), and addresses
   several recovery actions of the draft National Recovery Plan for the
   Grey-headed Flying-fox. The project proposal was also strongly supported
   by the NSW Flying-fox Consultative Committee.
   The project commenced in October 2006 and focuses on commercial crops in
   the western Sydney Basin. To date (May 2007), preliminary evaluations
   have been conducted, including total yield loss, damaged fruit
   (including that specifically attributable to flying-foxes and birds),
   flying-fox crop visitation indices and crop architecture. These
   parameters will be compared throughout the fruit season across different
   stone fruit and apple crop types and between netted and un-netted crops
   to examine spatial and temporal trends. The process of establishing and
   implementing the collaborative project is discussed, within the
   framework of flying-fox conservation and management in NSW.},

Abstract = {Increasing coastal flooding threatens urban centers worldwide.
   Projections of physical damages to structures and their contents can
   characterize the monetary scale of risk, but they lack relevant
   socioeconomic context. The impact of coastal flooding on communities
   hinges not only on the cost, but on the ability of households to pay for
   the damages. Here, we repurpose probabilistic risk assessment to analyze
   the monetary and social risk associated with coastal flooding in the San
   Francisco Bay Area for 2020-2060. We show that future coastal flooding
   could financially ruin a substantial number of households by burdening
   them with flood damage costs that exceed discretionary household income.
   We quantify these impacts at the census block group scale by computing
   the percentage of households without discretionary income, before and
   after coastal flooding costs. We find that for several coastal
   communities in San Mateo County more than 50\% of households will be
   facing financial instability, highlighting the need for immediate policy
   interventions that target existing, socially produced risk rather than
   waiting for potentially elusive certainty in sea level rise projections.
   We emphasize that the percentage of financially unstable households is
   particularly high in racially diverse and historically disadvantaged
   communities, highlighting the connection between financial instability
   and inequity. While our estimates are specific to the San Francisco Bay
   Area, our granular, household-level perspective is transferable to other
   urban centers and can help identify the specific challenges that
   different communities face and inform appropriate adaptation
   interventions.},

Title = {Anticipating ocean acidification's economic consequences for commercial
   fisheries},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification, a consequence of rising anthropogenic CO2
   emissions, is poised to change marine ecosystems profoundly by
   increasing dissolved CO2 and decreasing ocean pH, carbonate ion
   concentration, and calcium carbonate mineral saturation state worldwide.
   These conditions hinder growth of calcium carbonate shells and skeletons
   by many marine plants and animals. The first direct impact on humans may
   be through declining harvests and fishery revenues from shellfish, their
   predators, and coral reef habitats. In a case study of US commercial
   fishery revenues, we begin to constrain the economic effects of ocean
   acidification over the next 50 years using atmospheric CO2 trajectories
   and laboratory studies of its effects, focusing especially on mollusks.
   In 2007, the \$3.8 billion US annual domestic ex-vessel commercial
   harvest ultimately contributed \$34 billion to the US gross national
   product. Mollusks contributed 19\%, or \$748 million, of the ex-vessel
   revenues that year. Substantial revenue declines, job losses, and
   indirect economic costs may occur if ocean acidification broadly damages
   marine habitats, alters marine resource availability, and disrupts other
   ecosystem services. We review the implications for marine resource
   management and propose possible adaptation strategies designed to
   support fisheries and marine-resource-dependent communities, many of
   which already possess little economic resilience.},

Title = {Enhancing socioeconomic resilience and climate adaptation through value
   chain development of mountain products in Hindu Kush Himalayas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},

Volume = {23},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine and understand the dynamics of
   households' income in Hindu Kush Himalayan region in the face of
   changing climate and to explore the value chain development of two
   unique mountain products (yak and sea buckthorn) as potential strategies
   to increase socioeconomic resilience for enhanced adaptive capacity. The
   study seeks to answer that how local people perceive climate change and
   its impact on their household income and to what extent value chain
   development of mountain products prove to be a potential strategy for
   building climate resilience among local people? This study contributes
   to the existing scholarship on climate adaptation by proposing
   non-conventional and innovative livelihood strategies for enhancing
   climate resilience of local communities in four valleys of northern
   Pakistan. The research relies on both primary and secondary data. A
   field survey was carried out to collect data from 443 households using a
   structured questionnaire. This study shows that the mountain communities
   consider climate-induced natural hazards as major causes of change in
   households' income. To enhance the socioeconomic resilience against
   these climate vulnerabilities, cultivating sea buckthorn, breeding yak
   and developing value chains for related products has been suggested.
   Breeding yaks are both less labor intensive and climate resilient.
   Products made from yak hair and dung have the potential for high return
   if their value chains are established. Likewise, sea buckthorn is also
   considered less labor intensive and insensitive to extreme weather
   conditions. It could generate by-products used for food, medicine,
   cosmetics and construction. In order to improve socioeconomic resilience
   of local communities and enhance their adaptive capacity against effects
   of climate change, a value chain approach for yak and sea-buckthorn
   products has been proposed.},

Journal = {BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Amsterwarm project investigates the urban heat island of Amsterdam,
   the vulnerability of its population, the energy efficiency of its
   buildings and landuse. A novel mapping approach provides insights into
   the questions of what causes the urban heat island and who will be
   affected by it. Landuse does affect the surface temperature. The
   difference between the areas in the city with the least and the greatest
   impervious surface coverage accounts for an average land surface
   temperature difference of 11.6? per hectare. The study demonstrates
   furthermore that the vulnerability of people and buildings to the urban
   heat island effect is a local condition in which the energy efficiency
   of buildings, quality of life and demographic factors should all be
   considered in an approach that is sensitive to place. Practical
   application: The typological maps will allow local authorities to
   prioritise adaptive actions in urban planning in response to the urban
   heat island, an emerging climate-related challenge that has a
   significant impact on the comfort and health of its citizens and on the
   (future) energy use required for cooling buildings. Raising the albedo
   in those areas of the city that are dominated by impervious surface
   cover seems an effective adaptation strategy, suitable to a city such as
   Amsterdam that no longer builds on green field sites but only builds as
   possible within the envelope of the existing city. Improving the quality
   of life in neighbourhoods and the energy efficiency/climate proofing of
   the building stock could also be prioritised in the identified
   neighbourhoods.},

   Mekong Delta, Vietnam},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rice paddy fields, considered as a human-made wetland ecosystems, play
   important roles in food production and ecosystem conservation. Nowadays,
   rice cultivation in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, is under severe threat
   from climate changes, yet there is a shortage of documented information
   and research on rice production under future climate. Hence, the present
   study investigates the impacts of climate change on rice cultivation in
   the MD using an ensemble-modelling approach, implemented by biomod2
   platform in R software. Rice cultivation occurrence points,
   eco-physiological and bioclimatic data were utilised to model habitat
   suitability for rice cultivation under current and future climate, RCP
   4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios of the year 2050. The ensemble model obtained
   acceptable accuracy with scores of 0.880, 0.993 and 0.960 for KAPPA,
   ROC/AUC and TSS, respectively. Simulation results show that the mean
   loss of suitable land and mean gain of unsuitable land were 31.4\% and
   64.6\%, respectively, for the year 2050 compared to the present.
   Salinity intrusion, increases in precipitation during rainy season and
   decreases in precipitation during dry season were key factors driving
   the loss of suitable habitat. The findings of this study critically
   support policy makers and planners in developing appropriate strategies
   for adaptation and mitigation in response to climate change for
   sustainable rice cultivation.},

Title = {Real Options in flood risk management decision making},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Effective flood risk management involves the quantification of flood
   risk and the implementation of cost-effective, sustainable, and
   environmentally and socially acceptable measures that reduce flood risk.
   However, making decisions on the most appropriate long-term intervention
   investments can be challenging; this is primarily because of the
   uncertainties associated with future climate change and socioeconomic
   development. Real Options analysis is a widely recognised approach for
   encouraging appropriate climate change adaptation and mitigation
   investment decisions. To date, however, there has only been limited use
   of Real Options Analysis Techniques within the Flood and Coastal Erosion
   Risk Management community. In this paper, a methodology is described
   that has the capability to assess the most appropriate set of
   interventions to make in a flood system, given the future uncertainties.
   The methodology captures the concepts of Real Options and has the
   capability to value the flexibility associated with potential flood risk
   management intervention options across a range of future climate change
   and socioeconomic scenarios. The novel Real Options approach has been
   tested and verified on a real-life case study situated in the Thamesmead
   area of the Thames Estuary. The results obtained demonstrate the
   potential for substantial cost savings under future uncertainties when
   Real Options are used instead of more traditional, precautionary
   approaches.},

Title = {Poleward bound: adapting to climate-driven species redistribution},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},

Volume = {32},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {231-251},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {One of the most pronounced effects of climate change on the world's
   oceans is the (generally) poleward movement of species and fishery
   stocks in response to increasing water temperatures. In some regions,
   such redistributions are already causing dramatic shifts in marine
   socioecological systems, profoundly altering ecosystem structure and
   function, challenging domestic and international fisheries, and
   impacting on human communities. Such effects are expected to become
   increasingly widespread as waters continue to warm and species ranges
   continue to shift. Actions taken over the coming decade (2021-2030) can
   help us adapt to species redistributions and minimise negative impacts
   on ecosystems and human communities, achieving a more sustainable future
   in the face of ecosystem change. We describe key drivers related to
   climate-driven species redistributions that are likely to have a high
   impact and influence on whether a sustainable future is achievable by
   2030. We posit two different futures-a `business as usual' future and a
   technically achievable and more sustainable future, aligned with the
   Sustainable Development Goals. We then identify concrete actions that
   provide a pathway towards the more sustainable 2030 and that acknowledge
   and include Indigenous perspectives. Achieving this sustainable future
   will depend on improved monitoring and detection, and on adaptive,
   cooperative management to proactively respond to the challenge of
   species redistribution. We synthesise examples of such actions as the
   basis of a strategic approach to tackle this global-scale challenge for
   the benefit of humanity and ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Taiwan surrounded by water and has abundant and diversified marine
   environment and resources, so that Taiwanese life closely depends on
   marine and coast. However, with the increase of population and the
   change of economic structure led to the pressures on the coastal zone
   increase sharply in recent years. Meanwhile, owing to lack of
   comprehensive coastal development planning and the negative impact of
   climate change, the coastal environment and ecosystem have been affected
   seriously. Moreover, the impacts of climate change on the coastal zone
   not only affect the marine environment, ecology, and community of
   livelihood in marine activities but also have a strong effect for the
   sustainable development of national economics. Therefore, it is
   essential to develop social vulnerability assessment and establish
   adaptation measures in order to strengthen climate change adaptive
   ability. This study had carried out the social vulnerability assessment
   in Pingtung County to understand the exposure, self-protection capacity,
   and resilience to climate change in township level. The result shows
   that Jiadong Township (3.78), Checheng Township (3.67) and Manzhou
   Township (2.77) are the most vulnerable townships in Pingtung County due
   to the high exposure value (7.03, 6.74, 6.12). The results show the
   self-protection capability is the main factor of social vulnerability to
   disaster and the second is exposure. The effect of resilience is limited
   due to the value of different townships are similar. Therefore,
   Taiwanese government needs to improve and strengthen local disaster
   prevention system and self-protection capability, for example,
   informational system, mobilization system and inter-organization
   cooperation.},

Title = {Realities of bridge resilience in Small Island Developing States},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are acknowledged as particularly
   vulnerable to extreme climate events; however, the realities for
   transport infrastructure and bridges are still poorly studied. Assessing
   bridges in this context can be challenging due to data scarcity, a lack
   of local standards, and uncertainty due to climate change. While bridges
   are designed to connect transport networks, they also carry energy,
   water, and communication networks, making them critical cascading
   failure points worthy of special attention in terms of risk assessment
   and resilience measures. We explore what resilience actually means for
   the design and management of SIDS bridge infrastructure by applying a
   post disaster forensics and systems approach that is not reliant on
   complex methods or large amounts of data. To demonstrate the
   practicality of our approach, we apply it to the island of Dominica,
   which is regularly impacted by both tropical storms and hurricanes. Our
   results document the extreme conditions for infrastructure and nearby
   settlements and the complex interrelated physical processes that occur
   during these events. We reflect on the implications for design
   approaches for bridges under these conditions and detail specific
   recommendations on how the resilience of existing and new bridges can be
   enhanced through practical measures that are achievable, even within the
   constraints experienced by those managing bridge infrastructure in SIDS
   contexts. This work adds to the growing number of studies exploring
   forensic disaster investigation and systems thinking, but is the first
   to explore bridge resilience in SIDS.},

Title = {Surface heat assessment for developed environments: Probabilistic urban
   temperature modeling},
Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {53-64},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Extreme heat waves, exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, have
   major impacts on the lives and health of city residents. Projected
   future temperature increases for many urban areas of the United States
   will further exacerbate these impacts. Accurate predictions of the
   spatial and temporal distribution of risk associated with such heat
   waves can support the optimal implementation of strategies to mitigate
   these risks, such as the issuance of heat advisories and the activation
   of cooling centers. In this paper, we describe how fine resolution
   simulations of historic extreme heat events are generated and used to
   train a probabilistic spatio-temporal model of the temperature
   distribution in an urban area. We further demonstrate how this model can
   be used to combine temperature data from various sources and downscale
   regional predictions in order to provide accurate fine resolution
   temperature forecasts. Applications of this model are presented for two
   urban areas: New York City, NY and Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Based on
   simulated temperature data from fine resolution forecasting models, we
   find that this probabilistic method can improve the prediction
   accuracies of urban temperatures, locally and especially in the
   short-term, with respect to other temperature forecasting and
   interpolation methods, such as the use of average city-wide temperature
   predictions and estimates at discrete weather stations. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The recent re-emergence of industrial policy as a legitimate pursuit of
   governments in Europe and the US has the potential to open up a new
   realm of policy action for climate change mitigation. This would aim to
   align efforts to secure national industrial opportunities with the
   development of low carbon industrial systems, so as to generate both
   socio-economic and environmental benefits. The paper discusses the role

Title = {Potential benefits of a spatially targeted regulation based on detailed
   N-reduction maps to decrease N-load from agriculture in a small
   groundwater dominated catchment},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {325-336},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Denmark must further decrease the N-load to coastal waters from
   agricultural areas to comply with the Baltic Sea Action Plan and the EU
   Water Framework Directive. A new spatially targeted regulation is under
   development that focuses on locating N-mitigation measures in areas with
   low natural reduction of nitrate (N-reduction). A key tool in this
   respect is N-reduction maps showing how much N is removed by natural
   reduction processes, i.e. the ratio between the N-load out of the
   catchment and the N-leaching from the root zone for each spatial unit
   within the catchment. For the 85 km(2) groundwater dominated Norsminde
   catchment in Denmark we have analysed the potential benefits of a
   spatially targeted regulation and how its efficiency is affected by
   uncertainty in the N-reduction map. Our results suggest that there are
   potential benefits of implementing a spatially targeted regulation
   compared to a spatially uniform regulation. The total N-load at the
   catchment outlet can be decreased up to 8\% by relocating the existing
   agricultural practice according to the N-reduction map and thus without
   decrease fertilization inputs. A further decrease in N-load can be
   obtained by identifying target areas with low N-reduction where
   N-mitigation measures must be applied. Uncertainty on the N-reduction
   map is found to lower the efficiency of spatially targeted regulation.
   This uncertainty can be lowered substantially by using the mean of an
   ensemble of N-reduction maps. The uncertainty decreases with coarser
   spatial resolution of the N-reduction map, but this will at the same
   time decrease the benefit from spatially targeted regulation. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Global climate change and rising sea levels are impacting the
   sustainability and vitality of coastal communities, making identifying
   vulnerable areas particularly important to minimize the population and
   infrastructure at risk. In this paper, we expand the classic overlay
   method developed by Ian McHarg by incorporating sea level rise
   projections for the 2020s and 2050s into a GIS-based land use
   suitability analysis of New York City. This analysis considers
   elevation, slope, distance to coast, rock type, land cover, and sea
   level rise, which was modeled using a bathtub model. We use the
   analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to produce weights for the criteria
   considered. Our results suggest that Eastern Staten Island and the
   southern shore of Brooklyn and Queens are especially unsuitable for
   future development without major adaptation measures. We also offer
   recommendations for improving this analysis through improved
   hydrological connectivity measures in modeling sea level rise, as well
   as better methods of accounting for policies influencing the manner of
   development in flood zones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a spatial rural economy model of adaptation to
   climate change that accounts for a multitude of rural enterprises across
   a diversity of ecosystems in South America using household surveys. We
   model adoptions of crops, livestock, and forests. Both specialized and
   diversified enterprises are modelled. This paper finds that livestock,
   forests, and a diversification into crops, livestock, and forests are
   key adaptation strategies. Under the UKMO (United Kingdom Meteorological
   Office) scenario, a livestock-only enterprise would expand by 4 per
   cent, a crops-livestock-forests by 3 per cent, and a forests-only by 3
   per cent. Adaptation behaviours are closely tied with ecosystem changes
   under global warming. A livestock-only would increase especially in the
   grasslands. A crops-livestock-forests enterprise expands into
   xeromorphic forests. A crops-livestock expands in Andean grasslands and
   tall grasslands. A forests-only expands in the coasts and woody zones. A
   crops-only enterprise decreases across South America.},

Volume = {124},

Abstract = {Uncertainty forms an integral part of climate science, and it is often
   used to argue against mitigative action. This article presents an
   analysis of uncertainty in climate sensitivity that is robust to a range
   of assumptions. We show that increasing uncertainty is necessarily
   associated with greater expected damages from warming, provided the
   function relating warming to damages is convex. This constraint is
   unaffected by subjective or cultural risk-perception factors, it is
   unlikely to be overcome by the discount rate, and it is independent of
   the presumed magnitude of climate sensitivity. The analysis also extends
   to ``second-order{''} uncertainty; that is, situations in which experts
   disagree. Greater disagreement among experts increases the likelihood
   that the risk of exceeding a global temperature threshold is greater.
   Likewise, increasing uncertainty requires increasingly greater
   protective measures against sea level rise. This constraint derives
   directly from the statistical properties of extreme values. We conclude
   that any appeal to uncertainty compels a stronger, rather than weaker,
   concern about unabated warming than in the absence of uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Damage to infrastructure caused by anthropogenic climate change can
   cause dramatic economic loss and social disruption. According to the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change may cause an
   increase in the intensity of droughts, the frequency of floods, and
   increasing coastal vulnerability to tropical cyclones, storm surges and
   sea-level rise. This paper uses the stochastic technique Monte Carlo
   technique to explore the time-dependent damage due to climate change,
   considering the hazard as a stochastic variable. Three different time
   periods were explored: 2010-2035, 2010-2050 and 2010-2100. The analysis
   investigated no climate change and with climate change scenarios that
   affect the probabilistic model of hazard occurrence, and vulnerability
   functions that represent the potential damage for a given hazard. The
   probabilistic model and vulnerability models used in this study are
   relatively simple, but they can help to generate a framework of the
   time-dependent climate change damage and understand its economic
   behaviour. Parametric studies are heavily used in this study to explore
   a range of possible conclusions. The sensitivity of the change of
   parameters such as threshold hT, discount rate r, and time T are
   considered. The results are given in terms of mean cumulative annual
   loss. The discount rate was found to be a key parameter affecting
   cumulative damage prediction. Since damage often only occurs once a
   threshold level of hazard has occurred (such as a flood level exceeding
   the floor level of a house), then the influence of this threshold value
   on damage is significant. Damage/impact models utilising probabilistic
   hazard were used to verify the robustness of results. Results are very
   sensitive to threshold. Time-dependent predictions of damage can help
   decision-makers assess the impact of climate change and the economic
   viability of climate change adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Indicators of marine ecosystem integrity for Canada's Pacific: An
   expert-based hierarchical approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {645},
Pages = {1114-1125},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {There is great interest and rapid progress around the world in
   developing sets of indicators of marine ecosystem integrity for
   assessment and management. However, the complexity of coastal marine
   ecosystems can challenge such efforts. To address this challenge, an
   expert-based, hierarchical, and adaptive approach was developed with the
   objectives of healthy marine ecosystems and community partnerships in
   monitoring and management. Small sets of the top-ranked indicators of
   ecosystem integrity and associated human pressures were derived from
   expert-rankings of lists of identified candidate indicators of the
   status of, and pressures on, each of 17 ecosystem features, organized
   within 8 elements in turn within 3 overlapping aspects of ecosystem
   health. Over 200 experts played a role in rating the relative value of
   1035 candidate indicators. A panel of topic experts was assigned to each
   of the 17 ecosystem features to apply 21 weighted indicator selection
   criteria. Selection criteria and candidate indicators were identified
   through literature reviews, expert panels, and surveys, and they were
   evaluated in terms of the experts' judgements of importance to the
   health of Canada's Pacific marine ecosystems. This produced a flexible,
   robust, and adaptable approach to identifying representative sets of
   indicators for any scale and for any management unit within Canada's
   Pacific. At the broadest scale, it produced a top 20 list of ecosystem
   state and pressure indicators. These top indicators, or other sets
   selected for smaller regions, can then guide the development of both
   regional and nested local monitoring programs in a way that maximizes
   continuity while including locally unique values. This hierarchical
   expert-based approach was designed to address challenges of complexity
   and scale and to enable efficient selection of useful and representative
   sets of indicators of ecosystem integrity while also enabling the
   participation of broad government and stakeholder communities. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Coastal regions have long been settled by humans due to their abundant
   resources for livelihoods, including agriculture, transportation, and
   rich biodiversity. However, natural and anthropogenic factors, such as
   climate change and sea-level rise, and land subsidence, population
   pressure, developmental activities, pose threats to coastal
   sustainability. Natural hazards, such as fluvial or coastal floods,
   impact poorer and more vulnerable communities greater than more affluent
   communities. Quantitative assessments of how natural hazards affect
   vulnerable communities in deltaic regions are still limited, hampering
   the design of effective management strategies to increase household and
   community resilience. Drawing from Driving
   Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR), we quantify the
   associations between household poverty and the likelihood of material
   and human loss following a natural hazard using new survey data from 783
   households within Indian Sundarban Delta community. The results suggest
   that the poorest households are significantly more likely to endure
   material and human losses following a natural hazard and repeated losses
   of livelihood make them more vulnerable to future risk. The results
   further suggest that salinization, tidal surge, erosion, and household
   location are also significant predictors of economic and human losses.
   Given the current and projected impact of climate change and importance
   of delta regions as the world's food baskets, poverty reduction and
   increase societal resilience should be a primary pathway to strengthen
   the resilience of the poorest populations inhabiting deltas.},

Title = {Pedestrian Single and Multi-Risk Assessment to SLODs in Urban Built
   Environment: A Mesoscale Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Pedestrians are increasingly exposed to slow-onset disasters (SLODs),
   such as air pollution and increasing temperatures in urban built
   environments (BEs). Pedestrians also face risks that arise from the
   combination of the BE features, the effects of SLODs on the
   microclimate, their own characteristics (e.g., health and ability), and
   the way they move and behave in indoor and outdoor BE areas. Thus, the
   effectiveness of sustainable risk-mitigation solutions for the health of
   the exposed pedestrians should be defined by considering the overlapping
   of such factors in critical operational scenarios in which such
   emergency conditions can appear. This work provides an innovative method
   to define a BE-oriented pedestrian risk index through a dynamic
   meso-scale approach that considers the daily variation of risk
   conditions. The method is ensured by a quick-to-apply approach, which
   also takes advantage of open-source repositories and tools to collect
   and manage input data, without the need for time-consuming in situ
   surveys. The resulting risk conditions are represented through
   meso-scale maps, which highlight the risk differences between BEs by
   focusing on their open spaces as fundamental parts of the urban road
   network. The method is applied to a significant case study (in Milan,
   Italy). The results demonstrate the ability of the approach to identify
   key input scenarios for risk assessment and mapping. The proposed
   methodology can: (1) provide insights for simulation activities in
   critical BE conditions, thanks to the identification of critical daily
   conditions for each of the factors and for single and multiple risks and
   (2) support the development of design and regeneration strategies in
   SLOD-prone urban BEs, as well as the identification of priority areas in
   the urban BE.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to sea level rise (SLR) requires coordination among local,
   state, and federal entities and collaboration across governments,
   nonprofits, businesses, and residents. This coordination and
   collaboration are reflected in institutional arrangements associated
   with a whole-of-government and whole-of-community approach to regional
   adaptation. This study analyzes the development of an interlocal
   agreement (ILA), the Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Preparedness and
   Resilience Intergovernmental Planning Pilot Project (the Pilot Project),
   as an example of such an arrangement. This study assesses how factors
   throughout three phases of ILA development (initiation, implementation,
   and execution) influence outcomes and effectiveness. Drawing upon
   participant observation, document analysis, survey of participants, and
   interviews with key informants this study identifies factors that
   facilitate effective regional adaptation to SLR (impetus, agreement) and
   factors that hamper adaptation efforts (funding, ease of delivery), and
   offers insight into the complexities of institutional collective action
   to address contentious and challenging issues such as SLR.},

Title = {Classification of Typha-dominated wetlands using airborne hyperspectral

Journal = {AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Shoreline wetlands along Lake Ontario are valuable, multi-functional
   resources that have historically provided large numbers of important
   ecosystem goods and services. However, alterations to the lake's natural
   hydrologic regime have impacted traditional meadow marsh in the
   wetlands, resulting in competition and colonization by dense and
   aggressive Typha angustifolia and Typha x glauca (Cattails). The shift
   to a Typha-dominated landscape resulted in an array of negative impacts,
   including increased Typha density, substantial decreases in plant
   species richness and diversity, and altered habitat and changes in
   associated ecosystem services. Successful long-term adaptive management
   of these wetland resources requires timely and accurate monitoring.
   Historically, wetland landscapes have been surveyed and mapped using
   field-based surveys and/or photointerpretation. However, given their
   resource- and cost-intensive nature, these methods are often
   prohibitively time- and labor-consuming or geographically limited. Other
   remote sensing applications can provide more rapid and efficient
   assessments when evaluating wetland change trajectories or analyzing
   direct and indirect impacts across larger spatial and temporal scales.
   The primary goal of this study was to develop and describe methodology
   using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Coastal Mapping Program
   hyperspectral imagery, light detection and ranging data, and
   high-spatial resolution true-color imagery to provide updated wetland
   classifications for Lake Ontario coastal wetlands. This study used
   existing field-collected vegetation survey data (Great Lakes Coastal
   Wetland Monitoring Program), ancillary imagery, and existing
   classification information as training data for a supervised
   classification approach. These data were used along with a generalized
   wetland schema (classes based on physical and biological gradients:
   elevation, Typha, meadow marsh, mixed emergent, upland vegetation) to
   generate wetland classification data with Kappa values near 0.85.
   Ultimately, these data and methods provide helpful knowledge elements
   that will allow for more efficient inventorying and monitoring of Great
   Lake resources, forecasting of resource condition and stability, and
   adaptive management strategies.},

Abstract = {Catania covers an area of 180 km(2), with a population of 313,000
   inhabitants, and a density of 1,733 inhabitants km(-2), but it provides
   services for all city-users who enter the city every day (the
   conurbation size is about 800,000). Undoubtedly, in the next few
   decades, urban communities will be the main actors for mitigation and
   adaptation activities since city areas are the places where climate
   change strikes in the most extreme way, with challenging weather
   conditions, pollution, congestion, etc. Unfortunately, to date most
   Italian municipalities have not finalised any strategies to prevent
   and/or mitigate the new events related to climatic changes and too often
   they continue to adopt interventions in emergency situations after the
   damage has occurred. The present study, following some good practices of
   an integrated approach, involves the metropolitan area of Catania, based
   on cooperation between the University and Municipality of Catania, with
   the view to evaluate the main risks associated with climate change
   (desertification, soil erosion, urban heat island effect, flooding,
   etc.) and to develop new policies for urban landscape planning based on
   a green infrastructure. Drawing on great sources of biodiversity (Nature
   2000 sites, including the Mt. Etna National Park and the Simeto River
   estuary and reserve) the study suggests building an urban green LID
   network in order to increase the resilience, the efficiency and the
   sustainability of the Catania metropolitan area. Additionally, by
   linking the city to the Nature 2000 sites by a peri-urban agro-forestry
   belt these goals can also be met.},

Abstract = {Climate change is threatening to displace millions of people by the
   middle of this century, some of the most vulnerable countries being
   Small Island States (SISs) in the Pacific. Kiribati's historical
   `Migration With Dignity' (MWD) relocation scheme has been abandoned as
   an official government strategy, replaced instead by an approach based
   on economic prosperity, climate change adaptation and mitigation.
   Through a human rights perspective aimed at securing the minimally good
   life for those affected by climate change, this article seeks to explore
   and contrast in detail the potentials and limitations of cross-border
   relocation with the new adaptation strategy, exemplified in the ongoing
   urban and land development project in Temaiku Bight on the capital
   island of South Tarawa. It further considers increased quotas for labour
   migration and the creation of humanitarian visas and argues that while
   adaptation and economic growth may bide some time and regional
   cross-border relocations give no precedent for best practice, the best
   solution is a combination of options which cannot exist in isolation. It
   sums up the numerous policy issues which as a minimum must be addressed
   for there to be any hope of migration and dignity for the people of
   Kiribati in the years to come.},

Title = {Estimating the costs and benefits of protecting a coastal amenity from
   climate change-related hazards: Nature based solutions via oyster reef
   restoration versus grey infrastructure},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},

Abstract = {This paper examines the recreational use values associated with a
   coastal walking trail under threat from increased episodes of storm
   surges and coastal erosion, and the cost of alternative grey and nature
   based infrastructure options that could protect it. These options
   involve restoring an oyster reef bar that would act as a natural
   breakwater versus an impermeable revetment. The results of an on-site
   survey of users of the amenity and a negative binomial travel cost model
   demonstrate that the coastal trail has considerable recreational use
   value to local communities. In terms of a cost benefit analysis it was
   found that both protection options resulted in a positive net benefit
   over a 20 year time horizon but the nature based solution had a benefit
   cost ratio multiple times larger than the grey infrastructure
   alternative. The conclusions of the analysis remain valid under
   sensitivity analysis. The results suggest a compelling case for
   embedding nature based solutions in climate adaption and flood
   management planning for low lying coastal areas where recreational
   resources are under threat as it can be not only more cost effective but
   may also offer other ecosystem benefits to coastal communities.},

Title = {Predicting the distribution of the two bark beetles Tomicus destruens
   and Tomicus piniperda in Europe and the Mediterranean region},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {358-366},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1 Various factors such as climate and resource availability influence
   the geographical distributions of organisms. Species sensitive to small
   temperature variations are known to experience rapid distribution shifts
   as a result of current global warming, sometimes leading to new threats
   to agriculture and forests. Tomicus piniperda and Tomicus destruens
   (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) cause economic damage to pines
   in Europe and around the Mediterranean Basin. However, their respective
   potential distributions have not yet been studied at a large scale. The
   present study aimed to investigate the influence of climatic and host
   factors on the geographical distributions of both Tomicus species in
   Europe and around the Mediterranean Sea, and to establish maps of
   suitable areas. 2 Using 114 published localities where the presence or
   absence of both species was unambiguously recorded, we gathered
   WorldClim meteorological records to correlate the occurrence of insects
   with bioclimatic variables and to build potential distribution maps. 3
   The two studied Tomicus species presented parapatric distributions and
   opposite climate demands, with T. destruens occurring in locations with
   warmer temperatures, whereas T. piniperda occurs under a colder climate.
   Amongst the investigated climate variables, temperature appeared to be
   most correlated with both species distributions. 4 The potential ranges
   of both species were further restricted by the availability of pine
   hosts. It appeared that setting new pine plantations in regions where T.
   destruens or T. piniperda are still absent could favour a rapid
   expansion of their distributions. Our data will be useful when aiming to
   apply management strategies adapted to each species, and to forecast
   their potential range expansions/contractions as a result of climate
   warming.},

Title = {Historical shoreline trend analysis and drivers of coastal change along
   the Ravenna coast, NE Adriatic},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {77},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {One of the most important aspects of coastal zone management is the
   analysis of shoreline dynamics. Over the last years, beaches of the
   Ravenna coast (NE Italy) experienced large modifications, in some places
   narrowing or even being completely lost, thus threatening tourism,
   coastal assets and nature. Coastal erosion has direct consequences for
   Ravenna tourist-based economy, which largely depends on the attraction
   provided by sandy beaches. In this study, long-term (>50years) coastal
   analysis was used to identify the sectors along the coast where the
   shoreline position has changed, either advancing or retreating.
   Shoreline changes were measured on GIS environment by means of Digital
   Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) extension. Net Shoreline Movement (NSM)
   and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) strategies were employed to examine
   shoreline variability and reveal erosional/accretional trends. The
   results show that significant shoreline changes affected the entire
   coastal region, with most of the study area under retreat, mainly in the
   most valuable tourist assets of the littoral. The effects were found to
   be worsened by impacts of land subsidence, presence of harbor
   infrastructure and deficit in sediment budget. A simple shoreline
   classification was performed over the DSAS results and cross-checked
   with local knowledge of the area. The measurement of erosion or
   accretion rates in each studied segment is found to be useful for land
   use planning and coastal management plans, especially regarding the
   prediction of future shoreline positions. Especially important is the
   potential of the classification to identify areas of significant
   position change, with current and future implications for the design of
   sustainable shoreline management and mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {With regional variations, climate change has a significant impact on
   water quality deterioration and scarcity, which are serious challenges
   in developing countries and emerging economies. Often, effective
   projects to improve water management in the light of climate change are
   difficult to develop because of the complex interrelations between
   direct and indirect climate impacts and local perceptions of
   vulnerabilities and needs. Adaptation projects can be developed through
   a combination of participatory, bottom-up needs assessments and top-down
   analyses. Climate change impact chains can help to display the causal
   chain of climate signals and resulting impacts and thereby establish a
   system map as a basis for stakeholder discussions. This article aims to
   develop specific climate change impact chains for the water management
   sector in rural coastal India that combine bottom-up and top-down
   perspectives. Case studies from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, India,
   provide a basis for the impact chains developed. Bottom-up data were
   gathered through a vulnerability and needs assessment in 18 villages
   complemented with top-down research data. The article is divided into
   four steps: (1) system of interest; (2) data on climate change signals;
   (3) climate change impacts based on top-down as well as bottom-up
   information; (4) specific impact chains complemented by initial climate
   change adaptation options.},

Abstract = {This paper intends to discuss landscape resilience as a way of reducing
   disaster risk in the island of Madeira. Maderia is a Portuguese
   Macaronesian island that is located in the Atlantic Ocean and frequently
   affected by natural hazards. Here, the concept of resilience is
   discussed as a dichotomous and place-based concept and as a way of
   achieving sustainability, sustainability being one of the main solutions
   for climate change. This paper will discuss the complexity of defining
   ``resilience{''}, the contradictions involved in its use and its
   positive and negative applications. In order to make resilience an
   operative concept, it is investigated within landscape research, in
   which landscape is considered to be the result of human and natural
   actions and their interaction. Here, landscape is considered as a
   holistic, place-based, bottomup concept that can be used as a unit of
   measure for community resilience. As a consequence of the kind of
   relationship that a community builds with the landscape in which it
   lives, we can encounter different kinds of lansdscapes: riskscapes,
   hazardscapes, resilientscapes, sustainable landscapes, etc. These
   landscapes are investigated in the context of the island of Madeira in
   order to identify the resilient actions of its community. To conclude,
   today, Madeira is a riskscape and often a hazardscape. The most recent
   incidents were the fires of 2013 and the flash flood of 2010, which was
   one of the worst events in the history of the archipelago. However, the
   first signs of resilience have been identified, which represent
   interesting examples of increasing awareness in both top-down and
   bottom-up ways. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

Abstract = {Aquatic species are threatened by climate change but have received
   comparatively less attention than terrestrial species. We gleaned key
   strategies for scientists and managers seeking to address climate change
   in aquatic conservation planning from the literature and existing
   knowledge. We address 3 categories of conservation effort that rely on
   scientific analysis and have particular application under the U.S.
   Endangered Species Act (ESA): assessment of overall risk to a species;
   long-term recovery planning; and evaluation of effects of specific
   actions or perturbations. Fewer data are available for aquatic species
   to support these analyses, and climate effects on aquatic systems are
   poorly characterized. Thus, we recommend scientists conducting analyses
   supporting ESA decisions develop a conceptual model that links climate,
   habitat, ecosystem, and species response to changing conditions and use
   this model to organize analyses and future research. We recommend that
   current climate conditions are not appropriate for projections used in
   ESA analyses and that long-term projections of climate-change effects
   provide temporal context as a species-wide assessment provides spatial
   context. In these projections, climate change should not be discounted
   solely because the magnitude of projected change at a particular time is
   uncertain when directionality of climate change is clear. Identifying
   likely future habitat at the species scale will indicate key refuges and
   potential range shifts. However, the risks and benefits associated with
   errors in modeling future habitat are not equivalent. The ESA offers
   mechanisms for increasing the overall resilience and resistance of
   species to climate changes, including establishing recovery goals
   requiring increased genetic and phenotypic diversity, specifying
   critical habitat in areas not currently occupied but likely to become
   important, and using adaptive management.},

Abstract = {Regions with a Mediterranean climate are generally predicted to become
   warmer and drier with climate change. Estuaries in these regions are
   influenced by a broad range of climate drivers and are particularly
   vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We examine observed and
   predicted effects of climate change on the estuaries of south-western
   Australia (SWA), where sustained warming and drying trends have caused
   dramatic declines in freshwater flows of up to 70\% since the 1970s, as
   a case study of the impacts that might be expected in other
   Mediterranean regions. Current and projected impacts of climate change
   in SWA include progressive warming and `marinisation' of estuaries;
   extended closure of periodically open systems; an increased frequency
   and severity of hypersaline conditions; enhanced water column
   stratification and hypoxia; and reduced flushing and greater retention
   of nutrients. We document the effects of these environmental changes on
   the habitats, biota and ecology of SWA estuaries, including
   phytoplankton, macrophytes, invertebrates and fish. For example,
   decreasing river flows will cause periodically open estuaries across SWA
   to remain closed for longer periods, inhibiting the extent to which
   marine taxa can access these systems, thus reducing species diversity,
   whereas marinisation of permanently open systems will increase species
   diversity. We discuss the broader relevance of our findings, placing
   them in a global context and highlighting implications for ecosystem
   services and human populations. Finally, we consider the adaptation
   options that could be implemented to reduce the impacts of climate
   change in Mediterranean climate regions.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of Symbiodinium identity on coral host
   transcriptional profiles across latitudes},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {15},
Pages = {3103-3115},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals can increase their resistance to heat-induced
   bleaching through adaptation and acclimatization and/or by associating
   with a more thermo-tolerant strain of algal symbiont (Symbiodinium sp.).
   Here, we show that these two adaptive pathways interact. We collected
   Acropora millepora corals from two contrasting thermal environments on
   the Great Barrier Reef: cooler, mid-latitude Orpheus Island, where all
   corals hosted a heat-sensitive clade C Symbiodinium, and warmer,
   low-latitude Wilkie Island, where corals hosted either a clade C or a
   more thermo-tolerant clade D. Corals were kept in a benign common garden
   to reveal differences in baseline gene expression, reflecting prior
   adaptation/long-term acclimatization. Model-based analysis identified
   gene expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus corals that were
   negatively correlated with previously described transcriptome-wide
   signatures of heat stress, signifying generally elevated thermotolerance
   of Wilkie corals. Yet, model-free analyses of gene expression revealed
   that Wilkie corals hosting clade C were distinct from Wilkie corals
   hosting clade D, whereas Orpheus corals were more variable. Wilkie
   corals hosting clade C symbionts exhibited unique functional signatures,
   including downregulation of histone proteins and ion channels and
   upregulation of chaperones and RNA processing genes, putatively
   representing constitutive frontloading of stress response genes.
   Furthermore, clade C Symbiodinium exhibited constitutive expression
   differences between Wilkie and Orpheus, indicative of contrasting life
   history strategies. Our results demonstrate that hosting alternative
   Symbiodinium types is associated with different pathways of local
   adaptation for the coral host. These interactions could play a
   significant role in setting the direction of genetic adaptation to
   global warming in the two symbiotic partners.},

Abstract = {This article describes and analyzes the reintroduction of the ``wide
   green dike{''} in the Netherlands. It is a noteworthy example of
   implementation of an innovation in long-term strategic delta planning.
   The Dutch Delta Program was central herein. Pursuing its ambition to
   make the Netherlands climate-proof, the Delta Program invited a diverse
   set of actors to participate in developing a long-term adaptation plan,
   and also to propose innovative short-term measures to help realize that
   plan. The wide green dike was actively promoted by a local water board,
   with involvement of scientists and nature conservation organizations. A
   stepwise participatory process resulted in national-level recognition of
   the potential of the wide green dike, particularly due to its
   ``green{''} and ``adaptability{''} characteristics. Alignment of flood
   protection and climate adaptation goals with nature conservation
   objectives, as well as collaboration with new actors, were all crucial
   in the reintroduction of this innovation.},

Year = {2013},

Pages = {611-637},
Abstract = {Recent investigations have demonstrated global sea level rise as being
   due to climate change impact. Probable changes in sea level rise need to
   be evaluated so that appropriate adaptive strategies can be implemented.
   This study evaluates the impact of climate change on sea level rise
   along the Iranian south coast. Climatic data simulated by a GCM (General
   Circulation Model) named CGCM3 under two-climate change scenarios A1b
   and A2 are used to investigate the impact of climate change. Among the
   different variables simulated by this model, those of maximum
   correlation with sea level changes in the study region and least
   redundancy among themselves are selected for predicting sea level rise
   by using stepwise regression. Two Discrete Wavelet artificial Neural
   Network (DWNN) models and a Discrete Wavelet Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
   Inference System (DWANFIS) are developed to explore the relationship
   between selected climatic variables and sea level changes. In these
   models, wavelets are used to disaggregate the time series of input and
   output data into different components. ANFIS/ANN are then used to relate
   the disaggregated components of predictors and predictand (sea level) to
   each other. The results show a significant rise in sea level in the
   study region under climate change impact, which should be incorporated
   into coastal area management.},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Chronic and acute coastal flood risks in Miami-Dade County are assessed
   over the range of sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios for the coming decades.
   The HAZUS-MH coastal flood hazard modeling and loss estimation tool are
   used to determine flood extent and depth and corresponding monetary
   losses to buildings associated with different sea water levels (SWLs).
   The frequency of SWLs is estimated using a nonstationary mixture
   normal-generalized Pareto distribution under current condition and
   future SLR scenarios. Also, the least adaptation level to cope with
   SLR-induced amplification of coastal flooding is assessed in terms of an
   increase in flood threshold. The results indicate that under current
   sea-level conditions, coastal flood risks are predominantly from
   exposure to acute extreme events. However, chronic risks from repetitive
   nonextreme flooding may exceed those from extreme floods under future
   SLR scenarios. Therefore, adaptation strategies may incorporate
   consideration about chronic flooding to avoid increasing cumulative
   losses under future SLR scenarios.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {The study applies vulnerability index models to appraise livelihood
   vulnerability to climate change of human communities living in coastal
   fronts of some selectedmouzasof Namkhana Block part of the Indian
   Sundarbans. Primary household surveys (528 households in sevenmouzas)
   are carried out to procure data on indicators of socio-demographic
   profile, livelihood strategies, health, food, water, social networks,
   natural disaster and climatic fluctuations. The data then have been
   processed by indices like livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and
   livelihood vulnerability index-intergovernmental panel on climate change
   (LVI-IPCC) to evaluate and compare vulnerabilities ofmouzascurrently
   suffering from physical processes like coastal erosion, embankment
   breaching and flood events. The research outcome implies that Baliara
   and Iswaripurmouzasare highly vulnerable (LVI score > 0.600 and LVI-IPCC
   score > 0.170); Narayanpur, Mousuni, Kusumtalamouzasare moderately
   vulnerable (LVI score 0.540-0.600 and LVI-IPCC score 0.060-0.170); and
   Bagdanga, Patibaniamouzasare least vulnerable (LVI score > 0.540 and
   LVI-IPCC score < 0.060) to changing climate phenomena. The foremost
   reasons behind higher vulnerability are greater exposure to climatic
   fluctuation, natural hazards and higher sensitivity to improper access
   to food, health, water and finally lower adaptive capacity in terms of
   poor socio-demographic profile and livelihood security. Findings of the
   study provide a deeper understanding of people's perception, adaptation
   and their ever-increasing vulnerability to changing climate. This
   approach based on indicators emphasizes sectors that necessitate
   particular intercession to design management plans for threatened
   communities. Such type of pragmatic approach of study formulates
   reliable methodology to quantify vulnerability and develop disaster
   management strategies to increase the resilience of vulnerable coastal
   people to climate change.},

Title = {Should we adapt nature to climate change? Weighing the risks of
   selective breeding in Pacific salmon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY},
Abstract = {This paper uses the case of genomics-assisted selective breeding in
   Pacific salmon hatcheries to investigate how people weigh the risks of
   adapting nature to changing climate conditions. Drawing on 105
   interviews with people involved in salmon management, this study embeds
   risk assessments of selective breeding in the context of present
   interventions into salmon life cycles. While responses to novel
   technologies are frequently plotted along a support-opposition
   continuum, the debate over selective breeding Pacific salmon is
   multivalent, with respondents supporting selective breeding in some
   contexts while opposing it in others. Nearly half of respondents
   supported selective breeding to fix the mistakes of past interventions
   and rewild salmon. Given that past problems have stemmed from
   technological responses, these findings paradoxically suggest that
   further interventions may not necessarily be perceived as violating
   values of naturalness or wildness. Genomic technologies offer new
   pathways for climate adaptation. In doing so, they expand ethical
   debates about the role of humans and novel technologies in conserving
   and managing wildlife.},

Abstract = {Climate change and anticipated impacts of sea level rise such as
   increased coastal erosion, inundation, flooding due to storm surges and
   salt water intrusion to freshwater resources will affect all countries
   but mostly small island countries of oceans and low-lying lands along
   coastlines. Turkey having 8333 km of coastline including physically,
   ecologically and socio-economically important low-lying deltas should
   also prepare for the impacts of sea level rise as well as other impacts
   of climate change while participating in mitigation efforts. Thus, a
   coastal vulnerability assessment of Turkey to sea level rise is needed
   both as a part of coastal zone management policies for sustainable
   development and as a guideline for resource allocation for preparation
   of adaptation options for upcoming problems due to sea level rise. As a
   scientific approach to coastal vulnerability assessment a coastal
   vulnerability matrix and a corresponding coastal vulnerability index of
   a region to sea level rise are developed. In the development of the
   matrix and the index, indicators of impacts of sea level rise which use
   commonly available data are used. The developed coastal vulnerability
   assessment model is used to determine the vulnerability of three
   different coastal areas or Turkey; Goksu Delta (Specially Protected
   Area), Gocek (Specially Protected Area) and Amasra to present the
   sensitivity of the model to regional properties.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion and landslides have been a constant threat to Lyme Regis
   in West Dorset, UK for over 250 years. By the 1980s, the frequency and
   scale of coastal erosion and land instability had reached a point
   whereby the local council realised that a change from the previous ad
   hoc repair and protection approach was needed to secure the long-term
   future of the town. An environmental improvements initiative was
   developed from then onwards to provide a strategic and integrated
   programme of coast protection and cliff stabilisation measures designed
   to mitigate the increasing threat of climate change, coastal erosion and
   landslides, while respecting the site's unique heritage and
   environmental interests. This paper outlines the background and
   principal phases of the project that have been successfully delivered
   over the period 1990-2015.},

Number = {5},
Pages = {657-674},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the development of greenways/car-free trails as an
   alternative environmentally friendly communication system and assesses
   their strengths and weaknesses. It gives the results of a questionnaire
   survey of 1261 users along a 106-km greenway in Spain linking the
   Pyrenees with the Mediterranean Sea. Unlike previous studies, sampling
   was random and unequal probabilities of selection were properly
   accounted for. The results show a complex range of user profiles,
   tourist and non-tourist, their perceptions of the trail and some of the
   direct and indirect impacts of the greenway on the communities through
   which it passes. Management recommendations flowing from the survey are
   presented with the aim of increasing the use of accommodation services
   and businesses in the towns and villages near the greenway and helping
   create a more sustainable tourism system. The paper illustrates the
   potential importance of greenways in a future low-carbon tourism
   strategy adapting to climate change.},

Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {293-305},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {In the literature, the power of material deprivation in fostering the
   vulnerability of marginal urban areas is well documented. However, other
   forms of power that drive and underlie the exercise of material
   deprivation are rarely examined. The recent call for a more politicized
   view of adaptation reiterates the need to highlight and pay attention to
   the influence of other sources of power that drives vulnerability and
   underlie material deprivation. In response, this paper, through a
   discourse analysis of statements from urban actors at different levels
   and from documents/literature, examines the power of discursive
   constructions in fostering adaptation deficits and entrenching the
   vulnerability of residents of informal spaces. Through the lens of
   Lagos, the paper draws attention to how the imbued power relations
   emanating from dominant discourses fosters `misrecognition' and
   facilitates `adaptation deficit'. It highlights the discursive
   constructions on residents of urban informal areas as underlying and
   exacerbating the people's vulnerability to climate change impacts like
   flooding. The paper suggests that addressing this subtle but potent
   power through recognition and `un-naming' will facilitate viable
   development and adaptation policies that promote the inclusion
   objectives of the sustainable development goals.},

Volume = {25},

Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Tropical cyclone associated storm surges and their disastrous influences
   are becoming a major concern amongst the worldwide coastal community.
   The detailed risk modelling study seems an urgent need to support the
   storm surge mitigation actions. Using a Geographic Information System
   (GIS) based risk model, this study attempted to obtain both present and
   future storm surge wave heights in the Cox's Bazar Sadar Upazilla in
   Bangladesh. Linear storm surge model setup was done for the different
   return periods includes 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 years. Also, to assess
   climate change effects, a 0.34 m sea-level rise in 2050 was tested using
   the regional scale surge models. The simulated storm surge model
   provided a time series dataset for the risk model and obtained risk maps
   comprised of the relationship among risk zone and the return periods.
   With the present inundation depth trend, the acquired risk maps of 50
   and 100 year return period showed that 10.13\% and 36.4\% of the study
   area belongs to very high-risk zone respectively. Conversely, for future
   inundation depth conditions 30.83\% and 49.9\% of the study area would
   be within a very high-risk zone in 50 and 100 year return period
   respectively. This is envisaged that a detailed historical inundation
   dataset could enrich the adopted approach considering both present and
   future storm surge risk modelling for the Decision Support System (DSS).
   Also, this approach might be adopted for other identical coastal
   environments to aid mitigation programs and strategies.},

Title = {Public perceptions of cultural ecosystem services provided by beach
   nourishment and eelgrass restoration in southern Sweden},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Abstract = {Ecosystem-based protection is becoming a viable adaptation option to
   conventional engineered solutions to rising sea levels and coastal
   erosion. While the environmental and biological ecosystem services
   provided by ecosystem-based adaptation measures such as beach
   nourishment and/or seagrass plantations are being acknowledged and
   analysed, less attention has been paid to the social or cultural
   dimensions of these services. This paper builds upon the emerging body
   of research that explores cultural ecosystem services in coastal areas
   and how they are perceived by the people who live, work and recreate in
   these areas. The aim of the paper is to take stock of and understand
   public and stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services
   that may accrue through eelgrass Zostera marina restoration in tandem
   with beach nourishment in southern Sweden. The empirical research is
   based on an on-line open-ended questionnaire in the coastal
   municipalities of Bastad, Trelleborg, Ystad and Kristianstad. The
   results demonstrate that virtually all respondents had noticed a change
   in the coastline in recent years, mainly that the coastline had
   retreated. While beach nourishment measures were recognized among
   respondents to counter the shoreline erosion, there was very little
   understanding of the role that eelgrass plantations can play in creating
   biodiversity and benefits for society. Still, most acknowledged the
   importance of making room for water and biodiversity at the coast
   stating how the coastline was valued for primarily health and spiritual
   reasons. This knowledge will help local, regional and national
   decision-makers and regulatory authorities to make evidence-based
   choices for coastal protection, by complementing the analysis of
   environmental and physical ecosystem-services with cultural and
   socio-economic considerations. Nature-based solutions such as eelgrass
   reintroduction or beach nourishment should be tailored to the values,
   perspectives and perceptions of the local communities to help ensure
   their continued contribution to biodiversity.},

Abstract = {This article identifies ways to overcome impediments to restoring
   natural features on developed shores where human-use functions are the
   dominant driving forces. Suggestions are made for (1) incorporating
   natural features and natural dynamism into beach nourishment projects;
   (2) addressing constraints in size and space; (3) reducing the impact of
   human actions and elements in the landscape; (4) integrating endangered
   species programmes; (5) overcoming impediments to implementing
   restoration projects; (6) conducting post-construction evaluations and
   actions; (7) obtaining public support; and (8) addressing regulatory
   issues. Beach nourishment projects can better mimic natural landforms,
   while protecting infrastructure and habitat, creating space for dunes,
   and providing sediment for dune building. Dunes can have more value as
   habitat if sub-environments representative of natural gradients are
   accommodated. Greater human effort will be required to maintain both
   dynamic and stable zones for habitat, and these zones may be restricted
   to smaller scales. Controls can be placed on human actions, such as
   raking the beach, driving on the beach, walking through the dune,
   emplacing more structures than necessary and introducing exotic
   vegetation for landscaping. Regulatory restrictions that now prevent
   environmentally friendly actions can be eased, and adaptive management
   and education programmes can be implemented.},

Abstract = {Food-energy-water (FEW) systems are increasingly vulnerable to natural
   hazards and climate change risks, yet humans depend on these systems for
   their daily needs, wellbeing, and survival. We investigated how
   adaptations related to FEW vulnerabilities are occurring and what the
   global community can learn about the interactions across these
   adaptations. We conducted a global analysis of a data set derived from
   scientific literature to present the first large scale assessment (n =
   1,204) of evidence-based FEW-related climate adaptations. We found that
   the most frequently reported adaptations to FEW vulnerabilities by
   continent occurred in Africa (n = 495) and Asia (n = 492). Adaptations
   targeting food security were more robustly documented than those
   relevant to water and energy security, suggesting a greater global
   demand to address food security. Determining statistically significant
   associations, we found a network of connections between variables
   characterizing FEW-related adaptations and showed interconnectedness
   between a variety of natural hazards, exposures, sectors, actors,
   cross-cutting topics and geographic locations. Connectivity was found
   between the vulnerabilities food security, water, community
   sustainability, and response to sea level rise across cities,
   settlements, and key infrastructure sectors. Additionally, generalized
   linear regression models revealed potential synergies and tradeoffs
   among FEW adaptations, such as a necessity to synergistically adapt
   systems to protect food and water security and tradeoffs when
   simultaneously addressing exposures of consumption and production vs.
   poverty. Results from qualitative thematic coding showcased that
   adaptations documented as targeting multiple exposures are still limited
   in considering interconnectivity of systems and applying a nexus
   approach in their responses. These results suggest that adopting a nexus
   approach to future FEW-related adaptations can have profound benefits in
   the management of scarce resources and with financial constraints.},

Abstract = {The Eastern Nile Rivers (ENR), within the countries of Ethiopia, Sudan
   and Egypt, comprises the basins of the three major tributaries of the
   Blue Nile (Abbay), the Atbara River (Tekezze), and the Sobat (Baro-Akobo
   ), all originating from the Ethiopian highlands in the East. All three
   rivers meet with the White Nile in Sudan to form the main Nile which
   ends at the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt. Degradation and sedimentation
   (aggradation) processes or phenomena are the major environmental
   concerns of the watersheds or the basins of these tributaries as well as
   their impact on irrigation and other related hydraulic activities. This
   paper is intended to give highlights on the magnitude of the watershed
   degradation and sedimentation in the eastern Nile rivers problem,
   factors contributing to those phenomena, investigates watershed
   degradation and sedimentation management experiences in Eastern Nile
   Basin and recommends the best technique to be used to alleviate their
   adverse impact.
   The paper indicates that factors contributing to the problem include:
   wind and water erosion, and human activities. Wind and water erosion are
   the serious form of land degradation that leads to desertification and
   sedimentation of infrastructures. Watershed degradation and
   sedimentation is also caused by human activities particularly
   construction of reservoirs, pumps installation along river banks for
   water withdrawals, etc. Watershed degradation in the investigated area
   is mainly resulted from the clearance of vast areas in the upper basins
   of forested lands for cultivation, fuel wood, brick making, and over
   grazing. Bank erosion along the rivers has contributed to increased
   sedimentation elsewhere. This is because degradation is always
   associated with aggradation, which is sediment deposition. During flood
   period the Blue Nile and Atbara river transport respectively as high as
   2.6\% and 3.5\% by weight. In one hand, for the Blue Nile it is found
   that sediment concentration increased from about 700 ppm in early 1940s
   to more than 6, 000 ppm in 2003. The consequences of that is aggravation
   of sediment deposition in Roscires and Sennar reservoirs. The annual
   silt deposits behind the Roseires Dam (Sudan-Ethiopia border) have
   increased since 1967 indicating close correlation between watershed
   degradation and high sediment rate. The annual sediment rate at Aswan
   High Dam increased to more than 140 million tons. Girba The
   investigation shows that Roseires, Sennar and Girba reservoirs have lost
   30\%, 40\% and 60\% of their original capacities, respectively. On the
   other hand the paper shows that irrigation canals networks have
   witnessed high sediment disposition. For example, about 60\% of the
   annual sediment entering Gezira scheme-Sudan (880,000 ha) deposited in
   distributaries and fields. Another impact is that sediment deposition
   encourages die growth of weeds in channels with the consequences of
   decreasing water ways capacities and loss of water through the process
   of Evapotranspiration.
   The paper identifies that there are various mitigation measures used in
   the region to control the degradation and sedimentation processes. The
   most effective mitigation measures adopted to reduce sedimentation in
   reservoirs is by operational management and maintaining lower levels
   during flood season and by dredging of the inlets and irrigation canals.
   The paper concludes with recommendations to help improve managing,
   monitoring and suggest sustainable mitigation structural and
   non-structural measures.},

Abstract = {Sandy beach habitat where sea turtles nest will be affected by multiple
   climate change impacts. Before these impacts occur, knowledge of how
   nest site selection and hatching success vary with beach microhabitats
   is needed to inform managers on how to protect suitable habitats and
   prepare for scientifically valid mitigation measures at beaches around
   the world. At a highly successful green turtle (Chelonia mydas) rookery
   at Akumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico, we measured microhabitat
   characteristics along the beach crawl (rejected sites) and related nest
   site conditions (selected sites) to subsequent hatching success rates
   for 64 nesting events. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   report environmental data along the nesting crawl for a green turtle
   population and the first to use natural breaks in the data to describe
   their preferred habitat ranges. Our results indicate that turtles were
   likely using a combination of cues to find nest sites, mainly higher
   elevations and lower sand surface temperatures (Kruskal-Wallis test, H =
   19.84, p < 0.001; H = 10.78, p < 0.001). Hatching success was
   significantly and negatively correlated to sand temperature at cloaca
   depth (Spearman's rho = -0.27, p = 0.04). Indeed, the preferred range
   for cloaca sand temperatures at the nest site (26.3-27.5 A degrees C)
   had significantly higher hatching success rates compared to the highest
   temperature range (Tukey HSD = 0.47, p = 0.05). Sand temperatures at
   various depths were intercorrelated, and surface and cloaca depth sand
   temperatures were correlated to air temperature (rho = 0.70, p = 0.00;
   rho = 0.26, p = 0.04). Therefore, rising air temperatures could alter
   sand temperature cues for suitable nest sites, preferred nest site
   ranges, and produce uneven sex ratios or lethal incubating temperatures.
   Elevation cues and preferred ranges (1.4-2.5 m) may also be affected by
   sea level rise, risking inundation of nests.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) is believed to be the most dangerous impact of
   climate change in coastal regions. Adapting to its impacts has become
   imperative since SLR is now considered inevitable. Lack of local
   economic analysis of SLR impacts is one of the major obstacles impeding
   adaptation. To address this gap, this study employs a spatiotemporal
   approach to estimate the economic costs of future SLR as well as the
   benefits of coastal protection, a principal adaptation strategy, under
   four local SLR projection scenarios in the mainland Miami-Dade County,
   Florida. Our findings indicate that SLR impacts are nonlinear and
   coastal protection, while costly, can significantly reduce future
   potential losses. A novel spatial fishnet approach is also proposed to
   help local decision makers identify areas that should be prioritized for
   protection. Findings of this study aim to support local adaptation
   planning, and call for integrating adaptation for SLR and its
   uncertainties into local planning frameworks to achieve long-term
   sustainability and well-being of our precious coastal communities.},

Title = {Measuring climate change adaptation in Pacific small island states:
   nissology and success},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Pacific small island states (PSIS) currently experience harsh impacts of
   a changing climate: sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, internal
   migration and displacement. Are adaptation strategies based upon
   island-centric principles more successful than those originating from a
   more continental point of view? This research examined the principles of
   island-centric thinking using an island-centric lens by which to
   determine `successful' climate adaptation planning. The findings
   illustrate a statistically significant relationship between PSIS that
   have higher nissological (island-centric) levels displayed within their
   climate change action plans (CCAPs) and CCAPs that were found to be more
   successful. In other words, highly nissological states are forecasted to
   be more successful in planning for the current and future impacts of
   climate change than those with lower nissological scores. In total,
   nissology explains approximately 28.37\% of a PSIS's success. The policy
   relevance is rooted in the unique cultural, geographical, and social
   aspects of islands. Findings are applicable to other islands as well
   countries that share islander-based qualities. The methodological and
   quantitative-based areas of the study assist in forming policy-relevant
   determinations for island societies based on the climate-related
   parameters and metrics tested and evaluated herein.},

Title = {A Flood Risk Management Model to Identify Optimal Defence Policies in
   Coastal Areas Considering Uncertainties in Climate Projections},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to flooding from heavy
   rainfall, sea storm surge, or a combination of the two. Recent studies
   project higher intensity and frequency of heavy rains, and progressive
   sea level rise continuing over the next decades. Pre-emptive and optimal
   flood defense policies that adaptively address climate change are
   needed. However, future climate projections have significant uncertainty
   due to multiple factors: (a) future CO2 emission scenarios; (b)
   uncertainties in climate modelling; (c) discount factor changes due to
   market fluctuations; (d) uncertain migration and population growth
   dynamics. Here, a methodology is proposed to identify the optimal design
   and timing of flood defense structures in which uncertainties in 21st
   century climate projections are explicitly considered probabilistically.
   A multi-objective optimization model is developed to minimize both the
   cost of the flood defence infrastructure system and the flooding
   hydraulic risk expressed by Expected Annual Damage (EAD). The decision
   variables of the multi-objective optimization problem are the size of
   defence system and the timing of implementation. The model accounts for
   the joint probability density functions of extreme rainfall, storm surge
   and sea level rise, as well as the damages, which are determined
   dynamically by the defence system state considering the probability and
   consequences of system failure, using a water depth-damage curve related
   to the land use (Corine Land Cover); water depth due to flooding are
   calculated by hydraulic model. A new dominant sorting genetic algorithm
   (NSGAII) is used to solve the multi-objective problem optimization. A
   case study is presented for the Pontina Plain (Lazio Italy), a coastal
   region, originally a swamp reclaimed about a hundred years ago, that is
   rich in urban centers and farms. A set of optimal adaptation policies,
   quantifying size and timing of flood defence constructions for different
   climate scenarios and belonging to the Pareto curve obtained by the
   NSGAII are identified for such a case study to mitigate the risk of
   flooding and to aid decision makers.},

Title = {CoastAdapt: an adaptation decision support framework for Australia's

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Volume = {153},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {491-507},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Australia's coastline is exposed to climate change and sea-level rise
   impacts from erosion, inundation, and changes to storm tracks and
   intensity. It accommodates about 80\% of the population. Around 250
   local councils are responsible for coastal management, with very
   different capacities to undertake adaptation. A decision support
   framework was developed to support coastal managers seeking to
   understand present-day and future climate change, its impacts and
   possible response options. Extensive engagement was undertaken with
   practitioners before commencing the design and at all stages of the
   build, in order to ensure usefulness and usability. The resulting
   framework, CoastAdapt (coastadapt.com.au), provides comprehensive
   guidance and support, including understanding of climate change science,
   expected impacts, and adaptation options. It contains datasets on
   historical flooding; present-day coastal sensitivity to erosion; and
   future climate extremes, sea-level rise, and inundation for each coastal
   council. A risk management framework supports users through the six
   stages of adaptation from identifying the challenges through to
   monitoring and evaluation. The performance of CoastAdapt has been
   evaluated through 11 6-week test cases with coastal managers in the
   public and private sectors. In future, if CoastAdapt is to remain a
   useful resource, it must be seen by practitioners as dynamic, relevant,
   and current, and on-going resources will be needed to achieve this.},

Title = {Transformational adaptations to climatic hazards: Insights from
   mangroves-based coastal fisheries dependent communities of Bangladesh},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite having potential to tackle climatic impacts, transformational
   (also known as transformative) adaptation to climate change suffers from
   limited evidence. To partly fill this gap, this study empirically
   assesses the transformational adaptation to climatic hazards in two
   mangrove-dependent coastal fishing communities in Bangladesh: Mathurapur
   near the Sundarbans, and Batayan near Nijhum Dwip. The study uses data
   collected by semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and key
   informant interviews in 2018-2019. Results show that cyclones, floods,
   salinity intrusion and riverbank erosion adversely affect the
   communities. The study identifies five groups of transformational
   adaptation: system-wide (e.g., cyclone shelter), restructuring (e.g.,
   concrete housebuilding and livelihood diversification), path-shifting
   (e.g., migration), innovative (e.g., technological development) and
   multi-scale (e.g., reforestation programmes). The study finds that
   transformational adaptations are more effective to avert the impacts of
   severe climatic hazards than the conventional ones. Effectiveness of the
   transformational adaptation can be improved further by reducing
   uncertainty in climate projections, increasing awareness, building
   sufficient cyclone shelters, technological innovation, relocating people
   from hazardous zones, enhancing coastal reforestation programme and
   providing more fund for the implementation of effective adaptation
   strategies.},

Journal = {PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {104-117},
Abstract = {There is growing interest in using ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to
   maintain or restore ecosystem services to increase human resilience to
   climate change. However, to date, the focus on EbA has been on
   conceptualising the approach and encouraging its use, rather than
   understanding EbA in practice. We review the EbA literature to
   synthesise where, why and how marine and coastal EbA projects have been
   implemented and examine how EbA has been integrated with marine spatial
   planning. We focus specifically on EbA projects in Asia and Oceania,
   where climate variability and dependence on marine and coastal
   ecosystems is high. Most projects were found in the grey literature,
   implemented in developing countries, and targeted extreme events and sea
   level rise. Mangroves, particularly mangrove restoration, was the most
   common ecosystem used, followed by coral reefs. EbA across ecosystems
   commonly targeted capacity building and livelihood enhancement, and
   maintenance of wildlife, alongside shoreline protection for mangroves
   and food security for coral reefs. Integrated EbA and marine spatial
   planning projects were participatory, implemented at local-regional
   scales, displayed adaptive management, and community-based or shared
   governance. Our research helps to build an understanding of EbA in
   practice and a knowledge base to assist coastal communities in adapting
   to climate change.},

Title = {Coastal engineering evolution in low-lying areas and adaptation practice

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {162},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Coastal engineering is an important measure in coping with coastal
   risks. With global warming and sea level rising, the sustainable
   adaptation of the low-lying areas becomes urgent. An in-depth
   understanding of the relationship between coastal engineering and
   environmental changes can help improve the adaptation capability for
   climate change. Here, we use historical documents and synthesis approach
   to examine coastal engineering evolution on the Jiangsu coast, the
   largest lowland area along China's coastlines, and explore its response
   to local sea level and land use changes. The results show that coastal
   engineering here experienced a long-term period centered on sea-dike
   construction, with a shift from primary function of storm surge
   prevention since the eleventh century, towards a green coastal
   engineering approach in recent years. On the century scale, there was a
   close connection between local sea level change and coastal engineering
   change, while on the ten-year scale, population dynamics and land use
   changes were the key driving factors. Since the future climate and sea
   level change magnitude will be beyond what has been observed on the
   Jiangsu coast, it would be sensible to define a ``critical time{''} that
   divides the near future and remote future. On such a basis, a strategic
   plan for the remote future may be formulated to prepare for the critical
   time when inevitable inundation occurs, and a second strategic plan may
   be adopted for the near future, to buy time for the coastal communities
   to make necessary preparations and at the same time to continue to use
   the resources. For the ``near future,{''} a green coastal engineering
   approach (in combination with the experiences gained from the Jiangsu
   coast) should be developed to provide a low cost, high efficiency
   technique for coastal defense schemes. The thoughts outlined above may
   be applicable also to a number of low-lying coastal regions of
   developing countries.},

Abstract = {The ever-increasing anthropogenic activities have adversely impacted
   coral reef ecosystems and their ecological functions. This calls for an
   urgent assessment of the health state of these valuable ecosystems to
   justify the need for mitigation and proper management efforts. In this
   contribution, we used multiple indicators to assess the impact of
   intense oil-related activities on coral reefs in two near-by impacted
   and non-impacted islands in the northwestern Persian Gulf. The efficacy
   of indices was assessed using estimations of the effect size (omega
   squared), precision, and decision trees (Classification and Regression
   Tree (CART)). The results demonstrated that the combination of
   bioaccumulation of PAH in coral tissues, the percent of live coral
   cover, and the Sediment Constituent (SEDCON) Index were the most robust
   proxies reflecting the influence of human activities on reef's health.
   Based on sedimentary PAH concentration, the CART classified most of the
   indicators into two classes consisting of those in impacted and those in
   non-impacted locations, further supporting the feasibility of the
   employed indices. The findings of this study provided a warning of
   degradation in coral reefs of the island subjected to PAH pollution.
   This encourages decision-makers to execute routine monitoring and
   mitigation practices to maintain healthy reefs in the study areas.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Because coastal habitats store large amounts of organic carbon (C-org),
   the conservation and restoration of these habitats are considered to be
   important measures for mitigating global climate change. Although future
   sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these
   habitats, its impact on their rate of C-org sequestration is highly
   uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that
   relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C-org accumulation rates in
   boreal contiguous seagrass-saltmarsh habitats. Age-depth modeling and
   geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C-org
   accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional
   environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C-org accumulation
   rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL
   rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate
   change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact
   of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C-org
   sequestration in coastal habitats.},

Title = {Relevance of a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area to the Bering Strait
   Region: a Policy Analysis Using Resilience-Based Governance Principles},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Bering Strait, separating the North American and Asian continents,
   is a productive social-ecological marine system that is vulnerable to
   increasing maritime traffic. In other parts of the world, the
   International Maritime Organization (IMO), an agency of the United
   Nations, has designated similar marine systems as a Particularly
   Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) in an effort to protect vulnerable resources
   from international shipping. We present information about the 14
   existing PSSAs around the world and the political process by which
   designation is achieved. We examine specific characteristics of the
   Bering Strait system that are relevant to a PSSA application; these
   include vulnerable resources such as marine mammals and their
   contribution to the food and cultural security of indigenous
   communities, threats to these resources from shipping activities, and
   the viable mitigation options to reduce these threats. We then use five
   criteria derived from empirical research on resilience-based governance
   to analyze whether a PSSA designation would promote the resilience of
   marine mammal populations and indigenous communities to increased
   maritime activities. Despite the elusiveness of a definitive answer, we
   conclude that although the designation is not a perfect fit from a
   theoretical standpoint, it still holds the potential to benefit marine
   mammals and indigenous communities in terms of resilience. We conclude
   by identifying critical challenges and trade-offs that practitioners
   would need to negotiate when attempting to apply theoretical governance
   principles via real-world policy tools.},

Title = {Constructing climate change scenarios of urban heat island intensity and

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING \& DESIGN},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {902-919},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As the global population becomes increasingly urbanised, so interest has
   grown in the potential climate change impacts on city infrastructure,
   services, and environmental quality. However, urban areas are only
   beginning to be represented explicitly in the land-surface schemes of
   dynamical climate models through modified energy and moisture budgets.
   This paper summarises recent evidence of urban impacts on climate and
   vice versa. The technique of statistical downscaling is then introduced
   through exemplar studies of London's future urban heat island and peak
   ozone concentrations. Projections of both indices are derived from
   atmospheric variables supplied by four general circulation models,
   driven by a medium-high (A2) emissions scenario for the 2050s. The
   results show further intensification of the nocturnal heat island and
   higher ozone concentrations that are most pronounced in summer. These
   changes reflect sensitivity to variations in regional climate alone, so
   omit other factors such as changes in land use, emissions. climate
   feedbacks, or synergies between air quality and heat islands.
   Nonetheless, the downscaled scenarios are consistent with an emerging
   picture of increasing risks to human health in urban areas unless
   appropriate adaptation measures are taken.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {37-47},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The artisanal fishers from the Pehuen Co and Monte Hermoso (Argentina)
   are aiming for sustainable use of the common pool resource of their
   socio-ecological syStem (SES). However, complex interactions between the
   artisanal fishers and other actors (the industrial fisheries, natural
   reserve managers, fish traders, conservationists and governance
   authorities) are putting the fishing activity at risk. An adaptive
   management plan has been developed to analyse this SES based on the
   results of combining the analysis-orientated Systems Approach Framework
   with the action- oriented multi-Driver-Pressure-System-Impact-Response
   framework. The overarching issue is the sustainability of the fishery,
   although there are a number of sub-issues affecting the fishing
   activities including: restricted access to the sea, damage to the seabed
   integrity, fishing legislation, distribution of the product, and
   conflict of conservation with fishing. The most important pressures are
   overfishing and bottom damage, resulting in habitat deterioration and
   depletion of the stock. The main impacts on human welfare are the loss
   of income, the loss of jobs and the loss of biodiversity. A
   transdisciplinary management plan has been formulated based on common
   responses to these impacts, such as the organisation of the fishers into
   local associations, and the creation of a fishing terminal through the
   synergy of the community with researchers and the governance
   authorities. The long-term objective is to promote community based
   management of the natural resources of Pehuen Co and Monte Hermoso.},

Volume = {1},

Abstract = {Climate change increases not only the vulnerability of cultural
   resources, but also the cultural values that are deeply embedded in
   cultural resources and landscapes. As such, heritage managers are faced
   with imminent preservation challenges that necessitate the consideration
   of place meanings during adaptation planning. This study explores how
   stakeholders perceive the vulnerability of the tangible aspects of
   cultural heritage, and how climate change impacts and adaptation
   strategies may alter the meanings and values that are held within those
   resources. We conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals with
   known connections to the historic buildings located within cultural
   landscapes on the barrier islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore in
   the United States (US). Our findings revealed that community members
   hold deep place connections, and that their cultural resource values are
   heavily tied to the concepts of place attachment (place identity and
   place dependence). Interviews revealed a general acceptance of the
   inevitability of climate impacts and a transition of heritage meanings
   from tangible resources to intangible values. Our findings suggest that
   in the context of climate change, it is important to consider place
   meanings alongside physical considerations for the planning and
   management of vulnerable cultural resources, affirming the need to
   involve community members and their intangible values into the adaptive
   planning for cultural resources.},

Title = {Heritable variation in bleaching responses and its functional genomic

Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {9},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals are highly sensitive to rising ocean temperatures,
   and substantial adaptation will be required for corals and the
   ecosystems they support to persist in changing ocean conditions. Genetic
   variation that might support adaptive responses has been measured in
   larval stages of some corals, but these estimates remain unavailable for
   adult corals and the functional basis of this variation remains unclear.
   In this study, we focused on the potential for adaptation in Orbicella
   faveolata, a dominant reef-builder in the Caribbean. We conducted
   thermal stress experiments using corals collected from natural
   populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama, and used multilocus SNP genotypes
   to estimate genetic relatedness among samples. This allowed us to
   estimate narrow-sense heritability of variation in bleaching responses,
   revealing that variation in these responses was highly heritable (h(2) =
   0.58). This suggests substantial potential for adaptive responses to
   warming by natural populations of O. faveolata in this region. We
   further investigated the functional basis for this variation using
   genomic and transcriptomic approaches. We used a publicly available
   genetic linkage map and genome assembly to map markers associated with
   bleaching responses, identifying twelve markers associated with
   variation in bleaching responses. We also profiled gene expression in
   corals with contrasting bleaching phenotypes, uncovering substantial
   differences in transcriptional stress responses between heat-tolerant
   and heat-susceptible corals. Together, our findings contribute to the
   growing body of evidence that natural populations of corals possess
   genetic variation in thermal stress responses that may potentially
   support adaptive responses to rising ocean temperatures.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we explore integrated modeling (IM) methods and tools
   supporting adaptive management of estuarine and coastal ecosystems,
   particularly focusing on participatory system dynamics-based approaches.
   We describe Mediated Modeling experiences developed in the Guadiana
   estuary and the Ria Formosa coastal wetland in Portugal and present two
   integrated models (GUMBO and MIMES) developed to support the valuation
   of ecosystem services. These cases illustrate a multiscale IM framework
   underlying a progression from scoping to research and management models.
   We draw a set of lessons and suggestions for further research on
   deliberative IM platforms for coastal and estuarine systems.},

Title = {Land subsidence contributions to relative sea level rise at tide gauge
   Galveston Pier 21, Texas},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Relative sea level rise at tide gauge Galveston Pier 21, Texas, is the
   combination of absolute sea level rise and land subsidence. We estimate
   subsidence rates of 3.53 mm/a during 1909-1937, 6.08 mm/a during
   1937-1983, and 3.51 mm/a since 1983. Subsidence attributed to
   aquifer-system compaction accompanying groundwater extraction
   contributed as much as 85\% of the 0.7 m relative sea level rise since
   1909, and an additional 1.9 m is projected by 2100, with contributions
   from land subsidence declining from 30 to 10\% over the projection
   interval. We estimate a uniform absolute sea level rise rate of 1.10 mm
   +/- 0.19/a in the Gulf of Mexico during 1909-1992 and its acceleration
   of 0.270 mm/a(2) at Galveston Pier 21 since 1992. This acceleration is
   87\% of the value for the highest scenario of global mean sea level
   rise. Results indicate that evaluating this extreme scenario would be
   valid for resource-management and flood-hazard-mitigation strategies for
   coastal communities in the Gulf of Mexico, especially those affected by
   subsidence.},
